3515,,,1854-01-19,"This provision was vehemently and pertinaciously opposed, but finally prevailed in the House of Representatives by a decided vote. In the Senate it was rejected, and in consequence of the disagreement between the two Houses, the bill was lost.
At the next session of Congress the controversy was renewed with increased violence. It was terminated at length by a compromise. Missouri was allowed to come into the Union with slavery; but a section was inserted in the act authorizing her admission, excluding slavery forever from all the Territory acquired from France, not included in the new State, lying north of 36° 30'.
We quote the prohibitory section:
It is a strange and ominous fact well calculated to awaken the worst apprehension, and the most fearful forebodings of future calamities, that it is now deliberately purposed to repeal this prohibition, by implication or directly—the latter certainly the manlier way—and thus to subvert this compact, and allow slavery in all the yet unorganized territory.
We cannot, in this address, review the various pretences under which it is attempted to cloak this monstrous wrong; but we must not altogether omit to notice one.
It is said that the Territory of Nebraska sustains the same relations to slavery as did the territory acquired from Mexico prior to 1850, and that the pro-slavery clauses of the bill are necessary to carry into effect the compromises of that year.
No assertion could be more groundless.
Three acquisitions of territory have been made by treaty. The first was from France. Out of this territory have been created the three slave States of Louisiana, Arkansas, and Missouri, and the single free State of Iowa. The controversy which arose in relation to the then unorganized portion of this territory was closed in 1820 by the Missouri act, containing the slavery prohibition as has been already stated. This controversy related only to territory acquired from France. The act by which it was terminated was confined, by its own express terms, to the same territory, and had no relation to any other.
The second acquisition was from Spain. Florida, the territory thus acquired, was yielded to slavery without a struggle, and almost without a murmur.
The third was from Mexico. The controversy which arose from this acquisition is fresh in the remembrance of the American people. Out of it sprung the acts of Congress, commonly known as the compromise measures of 1850, by one of which California was admitted as a free State; while two others, organizing the Territories of New Mexico and Utah, exposed all the residue of the recently acquired territory to the invasion of slavery.
These acts were never supposed to abrogate or touch the existing exclusion of slavery from what is now called Nebraska. They applied to the territory acquired from Mexico, and to that only. They were intended as a settlement of the controversy growing out of that acquisition, and of that controversy only. They must stand or fall by their own merits.
The statesmen whose powerful support carried the Utah and New Mexico acts, never dreamed that their provisions would ever be applied to Nebraska. Even at the last session of Congress, Mr. Atchison, of Missouri, in a speech in favor of taking up the former Nebraska bill, on the morning of the 4th of March, 1853, said
 ""I* evident that the Missouri compromise cannot be repealed. So far as that question is concerned, we might as well agree to the admission of this Territory now as next year, or five or ten years hence.” These words could not have fallen from this watchful guardian of slavery had he supposed that this Territory was embraced by the pro-slavery provisions of the compromise acts. This pretension had not then been set up. It is a palpable afterthought.
The compromise acts themselves refute this pretension. In the third article of the second section of the joint resolution for annexing Texas to the United States, it is expressly declared that “in such State or States as shall be formed out of said territory north of said Missouri compromise line, slavery or involuntary servitude, except for crime, shall be prohibited;” and in the act for organizing New Mexico and settling the boundary of Texas, a proviso was incorporated, on the motion of Mr. Mason, of Virginia, which distinctly preserves this prohibition, and flouts the barefaced pretension that all the territory of the United States, whether south or north of the Missouri compromise line, is to be open to slavery. It is as follows:
 That nothing herein contained shall be construed to impair or qualify anything contained in the third article of the second section of the joint resolution for annexing Texas to the United States, approved March 1, 1845, either as regards the number of States that may hereafter be formed out of the State of Texas, or otherwise.”
Here is proof, beyond controversy, that the principle of the Missouri Act prohibiting slavery north of 36° 30', far from being abrogated by the compromise acts, is expressly affirmed; and that the proposed repeal of this prohibition instead of being an affirmation of the compromise acts, is a repeal of a very prominent provision of the most important act of the series. It is solemnly declared, in the very compromise acts, “that nothing herein contained shall be construed to impair or qualify” the prohibition of slavery north of 36° 30'; and yet, in the face of this declaration, that sacred prohibition is said to be over thrown. Can presumption further go? To all who, in any way, lean upon these compromises, we commend this exposition. -
From the rich lands of this large territory, also, patriotic statesmen have anticipated that a free, industrious, and enlightened population will extract abundant treasures of individual and public wealth. There, it has been expected, freedom-loving emigrants from Europe, and energetic and intelligent laborers from our own land, will find homes of comfort and fields of useful enterprise. If this bill shall become a law, all such expectation will turn to grievous disappointment. The blight of slavery will cover the land. The homestead law, should Congress enact one, will be worthless there. Freemen, unless pressed by a hard and cruel necessity, will not, and should not, work beside slaves. Labor cannot be respected where any class of laborers is held in abject bondage.
We earnestly request the enlightened conductors of newspapers printed in the German and other foreign languages to direct the attention of their readers to this important matter.
It is of immense consequence, also, to scrutinize the geographical character of this project. We beg you, fellow-citizens, to observe that it will sever the East from the West of the United States by a wide slaveholding belt of country, extending from the Gulf of Mexico to British North America. It is a bold scheme against American liberty, worthy of an accomplished architect of ruin. Texas is already slave-holding, and occupies the Gulf region from the Sabine to the Rio Grande, and from the Gulf of Mexico to the Red river. North of the Red river, and extending between Texas and Arkansas, to the parallel of 36° 30', lies the Indian territory, about equal in extent to the latter State, in which slavery was not prohibited by the act of 1820. From 36° 30' to the boundary line between our own country and the British possessions, stretching from west to east through more than eleven degrees of longitude, and from south to north through more than twelve degrees of latitude, extends the great territory, the fate of which is now to be determined by the American Congress. Thus you see, fellow-citizens, that the first operation of the proposed permission of slavery in Nebraska will be to stay the progress of the free States westward, and to cut off the free States of the Pacific from the free States of the Atlantic. It is hoped, doubtless, by compelling the whole commerce and the whole travel between the East and West to pass for hundreds of miles through a slave-holding region in the heart of the continent, and by the influence of a Federal Government controlled by the slave power to extinguish freedom and establish slavery in the States and Territories of the Pacific, and thus permanently subjugate the whole country to the yoke of a slave-holding despotism. Shall a plot against humanity and democracy so monstrous, and so dangerous to the interests of liberty throughout the world, be permitted to succeed?
We appeal to the people. We warn you that the dearest interests of freedom and the Union are in imminent peril. Demagogues may tell you that the Union can be maintained only by submitting to the demands of slavery. We tell you that the safety of the Union can only be insured by the full recognition of the just claims of freedom and man. The Union was formed to establish justice, and secure the blessings of liberty. When it fails to accomplish these ends it will be worthless, and when it becomes worthless it cannot long endure.
We entreat you to be mindful of that fundamental maxim of democracy-equal rights and exact justice for all men. Do not submit to become agents in extending legalized oppression and systematized injustice over a vast territory yet exempt from these terrible evils.
We implore Christians and Christian ministers to interpose. Their divine religion requires them to behold in every man a brother, and to labor for the advancement and regeneration of the human race.
Whatever apologies may be offered for the toleration of slavery in the States, none can be urged for its extension into Territories where it does not exist, and where that extension involves the repeal of ancient law and the violation of solemn compact. Let all protest, earnestly and emphatically, by correspondence, through the press, by memorials, by resolutions of public meetings and legislative bodies, and in whatever other mode may seem expedient, against this enormous crime.
For ourselves, we shall resist it by speech and vote, and with all the abilities which God has given us. Even if overcome in the impending struggle, we shall not submit. We shall go home to our constituents, erect anew the standard of freedom, and call on the people to come to the rescue of the country from the domination of slavery. We will not despair; for the cause of human freedom is the cause of God.

27873,John Quincy Adams,John Quincy Adams Event Timeline,," 
 John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson, Henry Clay, and William H. Crawford are all candidates for the 1824 presidential election. All are “Democrat-Republicans.”  Andrew Jackson receives a plurality of the popular vote (41%) and a plurality of the electoral college (38%). However, no presidential candidate wins a majority of the electoral college. As a result, the presidential election is inconclusive.  Crawford, Secretary of the Treasury, was the last candidate to be selected by a Congressional Caucus.  The others had been nominated by their state legislatures.
As specified in the Twelfth Amendment, the House of Representatives holds a contingent election to elect a president. Only the three candidates in numbers of electoral votes are eligible for the contingent election. These candidates are John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson, and William H. Crawford.
Speaker of the House and former presidential candidate, Henry Clay, formally endorses John Quincy Adams for the contingent election.
The 
 (Philadelphia) 
, allegedly from an anonymous member of Congress, alleging that Henry Clay reached a bargain with John Quincy Adams. This bargain was described as “one of the most disgraceful transactions that ever covered with infamy the republican ranks.”
A letter from 
 that he thinks the letter of 01/25/1825 is a forgery; or that the author is “a base and infamous calumniator. . .”
Adams is elected President by the House of Representatives with 54% of votes.  The Senate majority is comprised of by Jackson & Crawford Republicans;  in the House, Adams Republicans are the largest party. 
.  If the Constitution permitted, he would submit to a second popular vote.  Instead he hopes for “generous support from my fellow-citizens.”
There still remains one effort of magnanimity, one sacrifice of prejudice and passion, to be made by the individuals throughout the nation who have heretofore followed the standards of political party. It is that of discarding every remnant of rancor against each other, of embracing as countrymen and friends, and of yielding to talents and virtue alone that confidence which in times of contention for principle was bestowed only upon those who bore the badge of party communion.”
 But he retains Monroe’s postmaster general, secretary of the navy, and Attorney General (William Wirt). Generally, J. Q. Adams is very restrained in using executive appointments in a way that might build political support.
Erie Canal completed.  This was an undertaking entirely by the State of New York, but Federal officials took note of the success of the project and its revenue potential.
 Proposes broad range of internal improvements, contrary to the views of his three predecessors.  Notes that in March 1824 the Treasury purchased shares in the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal Co.  Notes a study under way for a canal from Chesapeake Bay to the Ohio River. Accepts invitation to send delegates to Pan American Congress in Panama which subsequently proves controversial in the Senate.
The final date of voting in 1926 Elections.  Both Houses of Congress have pro-Jackson majorities.

St. Petersburg Convention to the Ghent Treaty is Proclaimed [this event is noted in 1827 State of the Union Message.]
 Adams enumerates many surveys under way for roads and canals.  Called again for creation of a naval academy. Calls for Congress to manage the disposal of public lands.
Supreme Court Associate Justice Robert Trimble dies as presidential elections approached. 
. Andrew Jackson (Democrats) defeats incumbent John Quincy Adams (National Republicans) winning 68% of the electoral vote and 56% of the popular vote (not all states had mass popular voting).
