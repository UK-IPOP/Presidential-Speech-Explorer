## from nick

plz document missing data

provide field missing, url (for easy validation), and describe problematic behavior. This can all be in a markdown file

problematic behavior should be described using the html and css selectors... i.e. we scrape class="..." but that doesnt exist for this page, instead this page uses class ="..."
or instead of the data being in some element it is in another element.

Do your best to describe and write it out :)
