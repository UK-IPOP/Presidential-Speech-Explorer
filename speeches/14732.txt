 the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Attorney General have reported to the President that pursuant to the authority conferred and the duty imposed upon them by sections 11 and 12 of the Immigration Act of 1924 approved May 26, 1924 (43 Stat. 161), as amended, and in effectuation of the provisions of the act of December 17, 1943, entitled "An Act to repeal the Chinese Exclusion Acts, to establish quotas, and for other purposes" (Public Law 199, 78th Cong., 1st sess.), they jointly have fixed the quota for Chinese as hereinafter set forth:
, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the power in me vested by the aforesaid acts of Congress, do hereby proclaim and make known that the annual quota for Chinese effective for the remainder of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1944, and for each fiscal year thereafter, has been determined in accordance with the law to be, and shall be, 105.
The immigration quota for Chinese is designed solely for the purpose of compliance with the pertinent provisions of the two aforesaid acts, and is not to be regarded as having any significance extraneous to this purpose.
The Chinese quota established by this proclamation does not affect the quota for China established by Proclamation No. 2283 of April 28, 1938.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 8th day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-four and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-eighth.
