Dr. Erhard, distinguished guests:
It is always a pleasure to welcome old friends to Washington, but this is a very special day for us, to welcome Chancellor Erhard back to this house.
Dr. Erhard is known to the world as the architect of the German economic miracle, and the distinguished leader of a great nation at a very critical period in our history.
But to all Americans he is much more. He is an old and very trusted friend.
I am reminded of the words of George Eliot who wrote, "Friendships begin with liking or gratitude."
And even though our friendship began through official contact, it has evolved into the simple liking of one man for another.
It is a friendship that outlasts official position and special responsibilities, and one that will live as long as the men who hold it.
Mr. Chancellor, we are all indebted to Wartburg College and the University of Michigan for bringing you back to our shores. We all know that you richly deserve the honors that they are about to bestow.
We know that you will receive a warm welcome wherever you go. You are visiting a particularly interesting part of our country, one that I always enjoy.
Today, as so often in the past, you and I talked over the state of the world and we exchanged views on the major issues of the day.
I am grateful, as I have been many times before, for your wise counsel, and I am always strengthened by your understanding and your support.
In this room today from the Government, the executive department, the Congress, and from private life, men have come here who are your friends. They all join me in welcoming you back to America.
Gentlemen, I ask you to join me in a toast to the President of the Federal Republic of Germany.
