Mr. Prime Minister, Mrs. Barrow, Secretary and Mrs. Rusk, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen:
Mr. Prime Minister, it is a very great pleasure for us to welcome you and your lovely wife to the White House.
For those in our audience who are not well acquainted with Prime Minister Barrow, let me assure you that he is a very remarkable leader of a remarkable people--a lawyer, statesman, economist, and even a pilot. I assume, Mr. Prime Minister, that when the first three skills fail you, you can always get away from it all with the fourth.
Though Barbados is the newest independent nation in the Western Hemisphere, its people have practiced parliamentary democracy now for more than 300 years. Their House of Assembly was established in 1639 and it is the third oldest continuing legislative body in this hemisphere.
When I was in El Salvador in July, meeting with the Presidents of the Central American nations, I reaffirmed our belief that no country is so large or so rich that it cannot benefit from its neighbors.
Barbados is taking an active part in building a regional partnership with the other countries of the Caribbean.

--A regional bank, so long a dream, is close to becoming a reality.

--In April of this year, a Regional Development Agency was inaugurated for Barbados and for the seven neighboring islands.

--And Prime Minister Barrow helped form the Caribbean free trade area. Like the Central American and the Andean groups, the Caribbean Islands are now taking their place in an historic march toward regional economic integration.
Mr. Prime Minister, I look forward to meeting with you and renewing the close friendship that our countries have enjoyed. Ambassador Mann has told me of your cordiality and cooperation with him and we are very grateful.
Again we say welcome to the White House.
