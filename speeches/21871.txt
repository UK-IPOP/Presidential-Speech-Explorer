THIS DEMONSTRATION exceeds in significance for the nation's security even the most optimistic predictions that I had heard about the expected efficiency of this new weapons system. I am proud of the patriotic and competent personnel who have brought about this great achievement. Moreover, in the crew, officers and men, I find another example of traditional morale and training of our armed services personnel.
