The Administration strongly supports H.R. 3221, which provides a fair and orderly system for resolving the claims of U.S. nationals and the U.S. Government against Iraq.



H.R. 3221 would increase receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA). OMB's preliminary pay-as-you- go estimates are presented in the Table below. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from these estimates. If H.R. 3221 were enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published five days after enactment, as required by OBRA.
