THE PRESIDENT said:
"The administration is opposed to any entrenchment upon the statutory provisions for retirement of the public debt. The sinking fund now amounts to something over $430 million a year. Hitherto, we have allocated various funds, such as surplus or foreign debt payments, et cetera, to retirement over and above the statutory provisions which excess sums would, of course, be available for current use without trenchment upon the statutory requirements. It is sound government finance to hold to the sinking fund provisions of the public debt."
