 Today, Romney for President launched its newest radio ad, "Michigan Values." The ad features Congressman Pete Hoekstra (R-MI) and his wife, Diane Hoekstra, discussing why their family is proud to support Governor Romney. Having grown up in Michigan, Governor Romney's values are Michigan's values. As President, Governor Romney will work with Michigan leaders like Congressman Hoekstra to protect our traditional family values, strengthen our economy and change Washington.
