 Today, Romney for President launched its newest television ad, "Remember." The ad highlights the people of New Hampshire discussing the issues that important to them – lowering tax burdens, securing our borders and changing Washington. While rightly honored as a true patriot, Senator McCain has opposed tax relief, supported amnesty and is too much of a Washington insider to change Washington. On the issues important to New Hampshire Republicans, Senator McCain has taken the wrong approach.
The ad will begin airing today as part of the campaign's rotation in New Hampshire. Script and viewing links are below.


 "I'm Mitt Romney and I approved this message."
 "I believe John McCain's war record is outstanding."
 "He's a true patriot and has served his country long and well."
 "However, his record in the US Senate leaves a lot to be desired."
 "John McCain has been one of those Republicans that have been wrong on tax cuts."
 "Opposing tax cuts that would have helped our family, supporting amnesty for illegal immigrants, taking jobs away from Americans."
 "He wrote the amnesty bill that America rejected."
 "He's not really listened to the American people."
 "He's had his chance in Washington to make things better."

 "John McCain is not as conservative as Romney. He sponsored and still champions a campaign-finance law that impinged on fundamental rights of political speech; he voted against the Bush tax cuts; he supported this year's amnesty bill, although he now says he understands the need to control the border before doing anything else."

 "[McCain has] come into conflict with his fellow Republicans by joining with the senator Ted Kennedy to sponsor a liberal immigration reform bill that would allow illegal aliens to eventually become legal American citizens." (Jacob Weisberg, Op-Ed, "Awaiting The Return Of The Bull Moose," 
, 4/13/06)

 "The McCain plan – which is being put forward in the U.S. House by Arizona GOP Congressmen Jeff Flake and Jim Kolbe – allows the 11 million illegal immigrants already in the U.S. to stay in the country if they apply for legal status and pay a $2,000 fine." (Mike Sunnucks, "Napolitano, Hayworth Criticize Bush On Illegal Immigration," 
, 2/1/06)

 "Sens. John McCain and Ted Kennedy have a bill that, surprise, includes a generous guest worker program that would encourage border jumping. Illegals who register would have to pay a fine and taxes, but they would get to stay here and apply for permanent residency. That sure beats waiting at the border and hoping to be let in."

 NEWT GINGRICH: "However, the bill you mentioned – the Kennedy McCain bill – actually provides for amnesty. And it provides for amnesty for millions of people whose first act in the U.S. was to break the law. I think amnesty is profoundly wrong. I think it sends exactly the wrong signal." (Fox News' "The Big Story," 3/20/06)
- 
 "The McCain/Kennedy amnesty bill has been unveiled, and it's the same hoax we've fallen for before. Like the telemarketer who bilks a widow and then comes back in a different guise to charge a fee to 'help' her get the original money back, the anti-borders crowd created today's immigration crisis and is now offering as a solution the very policies that got us in this mess in the first place." (Mark Krikorian, "Fool Me Twice, Shame On Me," 
, 5/13/05)

 "The immigration compromise being debated in Congress does improve our criteria for selecting legal immigrants. Unfortunately, its inadequacies in dealing with illegal immigration – specifically, in ensuring that 10 years from now we will not have a new cohort of 12 million demanding amnesty -- completely swamp the good done on legal immigration. ... The amnesty is triggered upon presidential certification that these bureaucratic benchmarks are met – regardless of what is actually happening at the border. What vacuous nonsense." (Charles Krauthmammer, Op-Ed, "One Short Amendment," 
, 5/25/07)

 "'It's clear to any reasonable person that this is amnesty,' said Brian Darling, director of Senate relations for the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. 'It's forgiving individuals for being present in the country illegally and working in the country illegally as recently as five months ago.' That, he said, could come back to haunt McCain." (Christi Parsons, "GOP Foes Trade Fire On Immigration," 
, 6/5/07)
