 Public Resolution 25, 63d Congress, approved by President Wilson on May 8, 1914, attests that "the service rendered the United States by the American mother is the greatest source of the country's strength and inspiration", that "we honor ourselves and the mothers of America when we do anything to give emphasis to the home as the fountain head of the State", and that "the American mother is doing so much for the home, the moral uplift and religion, hence so much for good government and humanity"; and
 the said resolution provides that the second Sunday in May shall be designated as Mother's Day and that it shall be the duty of the President of the United States to request the observance of the day;
 President of the United States of America, do hereby direct the officials of the Government to display the flag on all Government buildings on Mother's Day, May 10, 1942, and I call upon the people of the United States to express the love and reverence which we feel for the mothers of our country by the customary display of the flag at our homes and other suitable places and by tokens and messages of affection.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 7th day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-two, arid of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-sixth.
