I HAVE today forwarded to the Senate the nomination of Mr. Benedict Crowell of Cleveland as Brigadier General in the Reserve Corps of the Army.
Mr. Crowell has long been a member of the Reserve Corps and gave most distinguished service to the country in important capacities during the war. This promotion in itself is not so material as the opportunity it affords to indicate the feeling of his many associates and friends in the War Department and my own feeling over what we have always considered was an inadvertent but yet a grave injustice.
