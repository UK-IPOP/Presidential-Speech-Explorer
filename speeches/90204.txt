We, leaders of the United States of America and the European Union (EU):
 that deeper transatlantic economic integration and growth will benefit our citizens and the competitiveness of our economies, will have global benefits, will facilitate market access for third countries and will encourage other countries to adopt the transatlantic economic model of respect for property rights, openness to investment, transparency and predictability in regulation, and the value of free markets;
 our shared commitment to increase the transparency and efficiency of our economic cooperation and to accelerate the reduction of barriers to international trade and investment;
 to improve the effectiveness of existing economic cooperation and to elevate and accelerate existing work to achieve tangible progress;
 that the transatlantic economy remains at the forefront of globalization, and that the United States and the European Union are each other's most important economic partners, reflecting historical ties as well as a wide range of common fundamental values, such as the importance of free enterprise, rule of law, property rights, free trade, and competition, and the protection of health, safety and the environment for our citizens and workers;
 our commitment to the 2005 U.S.-EU Summit Declaration on Enhancing Transatlantic Economic Integration and Growth, in which we resolved to pursue a forward-looking agenda to enhance transatlantic economic integration and growth, and our commitments from the June 2006 Summit to redouble our efforts to reduce barriers to transatlantic trade and investment and our pledge to keep our investment regimes open and to build on existing investment flows to boost growth and create jobs in the transatlantic economy;
 further that we have established a wide range of joint work in the areas of regulatory cooperation, financial markets, trade and transport security, innovation and technological development, intellectual property rights, energy, investment, competition, services, and government procurement;
 the launch of a study funded by the European Commission to identify existing barriers to trade and investment and estimate the benefits of removing such barriers.
Have reached the following shared understandings:
We seek to strengthen transatlantic economic integration, with the goal of improving competitiveness and the lives of our people. To that end, this Framework reaffirms a multi-year program of cooperation that emphasizes results and provides accountability.
In light of our shared commitment to removing barriers to transatlantic commerce; to rationalizing, reforming, and, where appropriate, reducing regulations to empower the private sector; to achieving more effective, systematic and transparent regulatory cooperation to reduce costs associated with regulation to consumers and producers; to removing unnecessary differences between our regulations to foster economic integration; to reinforce the existing transatlantic dialogue structures in regulatory cooperation both by intensifying our sector-by-sector EU-U.S. regulatory cooperation and our dialogue between the U.S. Office of Management and Budget and European Commission services on methodological issues: we resolve to achieve the goals set out in Annex 1 in a timely manner.
We have identified in Annex 2 priority growth projects, selected from the existing work program and other programs within the existing transatlantic dialogue, that will significantly enhance transatlantic economic integration, and we resolve to achieve progress on these projects within six to eight months of the effective date of this Framework, and at latest by the time of the 2008 EU-U.S. Summit. We resolve that future priorities are to be reflected by updating the Lighthouse Priority Projects identified in Annex 2.
The Transatlantic Economic Council is hereby established, to be co-chaired, on the U.S. side, by a U.S. Cabinet-level official in the Executive Office of the President (currently Allan Hubbard) and on the EU side by a Member of the European Commission (currently Vice President Guenter Verheugen), collaborating closely with the EU Presidency.
