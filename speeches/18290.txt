His Excellency Mohammed Ali

Karachi, Pakistan
I appreciate the warm expression of your gratitude for the action of our people in providing wheat for your stricken country. Our response to your call was made in the American tradition of giving help to the best of our ability where help is needed. It is also a true measure of the friendly feeling and admiration which Americans have for the people of Pakistan. We are proud to count your vigorous, young nation among our friends.
