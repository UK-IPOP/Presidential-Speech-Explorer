Good morning. Pool is en route to Joint Base Andrews ahead of POTUS' trip to Detroit, MI, where he will tour a General Motors electric vehicle factory and deliver remarks on infrastructure.
WH passes along the following background for today's events:

 Background on BIL for the President's Visit to Michigan
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will make a generational investment in Michigan's infrastructure and resilience.
Since the start of this Administration, the U.S. automotive industry has been on an accelerating trajectory to an electric vehicle future. Earlier this year, a few days after the President took office, General Motors announced that the company would go all-electric by 2035. In the months since, the President rallied automakers, representing nearly the entire U.S. market, around the goal of reaching 50 percent electric vehicle sales share in 2030.
 The country surpassed 100,000 electric vehicle chargers and 2 million electric vehicles on the road.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will turbocharge the shift to an all-electric future by:
Marine One touched down at JBA at 1:00pm, where POTUS was greeted by Colonel Matthew Jones, Commander, 89th Airlift Wing.
POTUS, wearing a red tie and dark navy suit, exited M1 at 1:03pm. He paused briefly to speak with Col. Jones before continuing to AF1. He climbed the stairs after a quick salute, turned and waved, and at 1:03pm boarded the plane.
He did not stop to field questions from the pool. We'll be wheels up for Detroit momentarily.
A reminder that deputy press secretary Chris Meagher will gaggle with reporters onboard AF1 around 1:30pm. It's his first gaggle. You can listen here, via the WH:

Press dined on white bean chicken chili prior to Meagher's gaggle, which lasted just over 20 minutes, and CNN played on the TVs throughout the flight.
AF1 is currently taxiing… more to follow
POTUS exited AF1 at 2:34pm and was greeted on the tarmac by Michigan Lieutenant Governor Garlin Gilchrist II. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is not taking part in the day's events.
Gilchrist, Biden, Sec. Marty Walsh and members of the MI Congressional delegation hugged and briefly exchanged pleasantries on the tarmac. After the lawmakers hopped in the car, Biden and Gilchrist shook hands and stayed behind to speak.
Pool is in the vans, and we're rolling as of 2:38pm.
Worth noting that a white Hummer EV, which POTUS will view at one stop of the GM tour, is part of our motorcade.
After a brief 25-minute ride, the motorcade arrived at the GM facility at 3:02pm. It's a very grey and wet day, but thankfully the rain has stopped (for now).
There were a dozen or so onlookers/McDonalds patrons filming the motorcade as we departed the airport, and significantly larger number of climate activists protesting the Line 5 pipeline present when the motorcade exited the highway. Pool spotted at least one "Michigan Loves Biden" sign in the crowd.
Pool vans split off from the rest of the motorcade upon arrival. We're heading directly to the first tour stop ahead of POTUS and have not had eyes on him since leaving the airport… more to follow
Gov. Whitmer's office passed along the following statement to co-pooler Jim Tankersley, confirming that her absence is due to meeting with semiconductor industry leaders in CA:
While the governor would like to be with the president today celebrating passage of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and highlighting the thousands of good-paying blue collar jobs that will result from this historic investment in our state's infrastructure, Governor Whitmer was unable to attend the event today due to previously scheduled meetings, including with leaders in the semiconductor industry. The governor is committed to ensuring that Michigan remains the automobile capital of the world by securing additional investments in the future of mobility.
Governor Whitmer is continuing her leadership in working to boost domestic semiconductor production amid the current automotive chip crisis by meeting with semiconductor industry leaders on Thursday in California. This will include a meeting with the Semiconductor Industry Association Board of Directors to discuss ongoing efforts to increase domestic chip production and innovation, through efforts such as the CHIPS Act, and the state-level impacts of these efforts. The Governor will also attend the Semiconductor Industry Association's annual event, which brings together some of the biggest companies in the industry.
These conversations follow the Governor's action last week to join a bipartisan coalition of governors calling on Congress to pass the CHIPS Act to support Michigan's automotive and manufacturing industry amidst the ongoing chip shortage. And it highlights the state's ongoing commitment to landing historic investments in the automotive sector, like the KLA and SK Siltron investments, which will create more than one thousand good-paying, high-tech jobs and bring hundreds of millions of dollars to our state's economy.
Governor Whitmer will be joined by MEDC CEO Quentin Messer, Jr. in her meetings with semiconductor industry leadership.
POTUS met back up with pool on the factory floor for the first stop on the 3 part tour, a Trim Electrical test, at 3:22pm.

POTUS remarked that "China got way ahead of us" and that GM is helping to "change everything"
"It's incredible, it's incredible…"
More, light quotes from POTUS at stop 2…
Biden remarked if he'd "been asleep for the past 50 years," then woke up and saw these new GMs, he'd swap "title for title" with his favorite Corvette
Added that jobs like those at this factory are among the "most coveted" of union positions
At one point in the tour, Marvin Gaye's version of "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" began playing in the factory, but pool could not identify the source
Pool left POTUS to jp on a trolley to head to stop 3 at of 3:37pm
The Beast dropped off POTUS and Barra at the Hummer test drive locale at 3:49. After waving to the crowd, Biden hopped in the front seat and took a couple laps, complete with one burnout.
We're still holding waiting for he and Barra to return to the group
"Anyone want to jump in the back, or on the roof?," POTUS joked with pool and attendees after taking a few more laps and a second burnout. "These suckers are something else!"
Some video of POTUS putting petal to metal:
Biden excitedly complemented the vehicle's steering radius but did not answer when asked by the pool how fast he was going. POTUS and the MI delegation then posed for a photo by the EVH.
Pool again separated from POTUS and is now heading to the speech filing center as of 4:02pm
Pool settled into the filing center at 4:12pm. POTUS is currently scheduled to start speaking at 4:30pm, which you can stream here: 
The room itself appears to be a cleared section of the factory floor. In addition to the GM signage promoting the opening of their Factory Zero, a number of large WH banners are hanging from the ceiling. One in blue reads "BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE DEAL," while a red one — complete with cartoon-ized Hummer blueprints — reads "THE FUTURE IS MADE IN AMERICA."
A selection of Motown hits is playing while the crowd waits for the program to begin.

Pool Reports below by 
, 
Good afternoon from your pooler, who just witnessed a famous person heading into the White House: singer Ciara is here to discuss childhood vaccinations with First Lady Jill Biden. She, her children and others were led into the building by principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, who previously got to hang out with UCONN legend Sue Bird.
The president will shortly depart Washington for Detroit, Michigan, where he will tour a plant that produces electrical vehicles and make remarks on the infrastructure plan he signed into law in a very chilly South Lawn ceremony on Monday. Those remarks are scheduled for 4:30 pm.
Pool will be on hand for his return to Washington, currently projected for 7:20 pm.
Protesters in favor of expanded voting rights protections have gathered on Pennsylvania Avenue at the White House gates, and also on Lafayette Park. I won't venture a crowd size estimate, but the group was sizable, if not enormous.
Nearby a group called Care in Action has someone dressed as the Build Back Better bill parading in front of the White House.
It is a clement day here in Washington. Meanwhile, the National Weather Service is expecting rain in Detroit, for which the president is imminently departing.
The following officials will be traveling on Marine One with the president, en route to Detroit, according to the White Hiuse:
Bruce Reed, Assistant to the President & Deputy Chief of Staff
Annie Tomasini, Assistant to the President & Director of Oval Office Operations
Brett McGurk, Deputy Assistant to the President & Coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa
Ali Zaidi, Deputy Assistant to the President & Deputy National Climate Advisor
Stephen Goepfert, Special Assistant to the President & Personal Aide to the President
Biden walked out of the West Wing at 12:46 pm.
But instead of boarding Marine One, as expected, he swung back towards the White House.
Excitement rippled through the press corps.
Alas, we were not the focus of his attention. Biden walked towards the South Portico, where First Lady Dr. Jill Biden, Ciara, her three children and an unidentified staffer were waiting.
The president ascended a couple of steps up the portico and exchanged a few words with the First Lady and Ciara, though it was impossible to hear what they said. He then walked towards Marine One, which lifted off at 12:52 pm (the aforementioned West Wing travel party had boarded the helicopter while the president exchanged goodbyes with the First Lady and guests).
Ciara's youngest son waved enthusiastically.
Apologies that this did not come earlier, but the Air Force One gaggle with deputy press secretary Chris Meagher can (belatedly) be found here:
Marine One landed on the South Lawn at 8:13 pm.
The President deplaned (de-helicoptered?) at 8:14 pm.
One of the poolers shouted a question about the censure of Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz.
"I don't know what happened," Biden responded as he walked into the White House.
A visual of the scene:
That's all for today from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Good night and good luck.
