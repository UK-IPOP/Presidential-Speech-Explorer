The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today unveiled chairs and co-chairs in 25 additional counties across Florida. These new county leaders join previously announced county chairs and co-chairs, demonstrating Rudy's continued commitment to building a strong grassroots team in the state.
Today's county leadership announcement follows Rudy's endorsements from former Florida Governor Bob Martinez and former Florida Commissioner of Education and State Senator Jim Horne earlier this week.
"This announcement of our strong county leadership from across Florida is further proof that Rudy has the team it will take to win Florida's primary and general elections," said Karen Unger, Giuliani's Senior Advisor in Florida.
The campaign will continue making Florida leadership announcements in the coming weeks.
