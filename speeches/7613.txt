To the Senate:
I transmit for the information of the Senate in connection with its consideration of the convention between the United States of America and His Majesty the King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, Emperor of India, for the Preservation and improvement of the scenic beauty of the Niagara Falls and Rapids, signed at Ottawa on January 2, 1929 (Senate Executive U, 70th Congress, 2d Session), the final report of the Special International Niagara Board, together with an accompanying report from the Acting Secretary of State and its enclosed copy of a letter from the Secretary of War.
The attention of the Senate is invited to the hope expressed by the Secretary of War that the valuable studies contained in the report may be preserved and made available for future studies by publication as a public document.
