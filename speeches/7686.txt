My dear Mr. Reece:
I hear that your opponents are charging you with failure to serve the interests of your constituents because you refused to accept the Senate plan for dealing with Muscle Shoals.
The fact is that the House plan will secure development of this great resource more effectively and more greatly in the interests of Tennessee than would the Senate plan. I am assured that the Senate plan cannot be passed in the House. Nor would I approve that plan because it is not in the interest of Tennessee or the rest of the nation. Your course has been the only one that will secure an advancement of this development in the interest of the people of Tennessee.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[The Honorable Carroll Reece, Johnson City, Tenn.]
