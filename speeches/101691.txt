WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, President Obama signed the 
, which delivered a significant down payment on the President's ambitious agenda to make higher education more affordable and help more Americans earn a college degree.
This legislation strengthens the Pell Grant program, invests in community colleges, extends support for Historically Black Colleges and other Minority Serving Institutions, and helps student borrowers manage their student loan debt by capping repayments at 10% of their discretionary income. Â These efforts will be fully paid for by ending the government subsidies currently given to banks and other financial institutions that make guaranteed federal student loans and free up nearly $68 billion for college affordability and deficit reduction over the next 11 years.
"For a long time, our student loan system has worked for banks and financial institutions," President Obama said. "Today, we're finally making our student loan system work for students and all of our families."
"This legislation is a win for students and parents struggling to make ends meet to fulfill the dream of a college education," Education Secretary Arne Duncan said. "By ending subsidies to banks, we can make important investments that increase affordability and access to our nation's universities and community colleges."
This historic law:
Starting July 1, all new federal student loans will be direct loans, delivered and collected by private companies under performance-based contracts with the Department of Education. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, ending these wasteful subsidies will free up nearly $68 billion for college affordability and deficit reduction over the next 11 years.
