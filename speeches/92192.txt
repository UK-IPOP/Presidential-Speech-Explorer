CEDAR RAPIDS, IA -- New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson today announced his plan to protect the middle class and create quality jobs.
"The Bush administration's economic policies have failed the middle class, created huge deficits, and caused wages to stagnate," said Governor Richardson. "We have created over 80,000 jobs in New Mexico. We have balanced five budgets and offered tax credits to pro-growth employers. My record of promoting responsible development is unmatched."
Governor Richardson outlined the following details of his plan:
"We can balance the federal budget and avoid passing on debt to our children. We can give tax credits to responsible employers who pay above the prevailing wage. We can develop renewable energy technologies to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and sustain the environment," Richardson said"All of this is possible. The country just needs a president who knows how to get things done."
