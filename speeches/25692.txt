THERE is nothing Americans care about more deeply than the education of their children. The Federal Government is spending large sums to help States, local communities, and institutions strengthen their educational programs. A number of Federal agencies have programs which aid education. We want to be certain that every dollar is spent in such a way as to strengthen our schools, preserve local initiative, and contribute to better opportunities for the boys and girls and young men and women of this Nation.
