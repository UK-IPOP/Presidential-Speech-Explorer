MYRTLE BEACH, S.C.-Speaking to reporters at a tea party convention in here, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee praised Iran's decision to release four Americans held as prisoners, while he criticized the Obama administration's negotiating strategy. "It's great that these prisoners have been released," Huckabee said. "They should have been released before we ever sat down at the negotiating table. They've been there more than a year too long. Actually, they've been there several years too long. I'm grateful that they're released and free, especially Pastor [Saeed] Abedini and the Washington Post reporter, who was clearly railroaded into some false charge. Why it took this long, I have no idea, but today we should rejoice for their families." Two days earlier...Huckabee had told the Washington Post that a tougher president might have already secured the release of the prisoners….Huckabee reiterated that he.. was inclined to immediately end the nuclear agreement and restore the sanctions on Iran. "We should have not only kept them, we should have tightened them," said Huckabee. "This would be like Neville Chamberlain writing a $150 billion check to the Nazis before World War II, and saying, 'Y'all be careful with that money.'"
GOP presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee delivered a message on Saturday to the South Carolina Tea Party Coalition Convention about faith, American values, and taking the White House back from the Democratic Party..."People in our country and party are disgusted with politics as usual," said Huckabee, itemizing a list of changes he would make in Washington if elected president, including the elimination of the IRS..."With the IRS, you are presumed guilty until you prove with a shoebox full of receipts that you aren't guilty," Huckabee said...Hundreds of people filled the convention room at the Springmaid Beach Resort in Myrtle Beach to hear the former Arkansas governor make his case for South Carolina's February primary and ultimately the Republican nomination..."This country needs leadership, monetarily, militarily and morally," Huckabee said. "We are losing this nation because folks have forgotten what it means to serve, and not be served."
DES MOINES, Iowa — ...Janet Huckabee campaigned at the March For Life rally at the Iowa State Capitol on Saturday. Huckabee says she and her husband, Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, are 100 percent pro-life. The annual event is aimed at educating others on the negative effects of abortion and to encourage other options, like adoption. The event's organizers say having the support of Huckabee helps their campaign efforts. "She came to the march, she attended and walked the march with us and that is a huge affirmation to us that we are moving in the right direction," Jenifer Bowen said. "The March for Life had to start somewhere, and we are starting and we are gaining national attention." More than 1,000 people attended Saturday's rally.
MYRTLE BEACH, S.C.—Gov. Mike Huckabee released the following statement in response to the release of four Americans from Iranian prison."Praise God that Christian pastor Saeed Abedini has been freed from his eight-year prison sentence for serving the Lord, spreading the Gospel and planting house churches across Iran….But why did it take the Obama Administration so long to secure his release?...Empowering Iran with sanctions relief is like Neville Chamberlain writing a $150 billion check to Adolf Hitler before WWII hoping he'll behave. This Iran deal is an insane disaster and this White House has lost its mind…."
...And former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, while praising the release of Abedini, asked why it took the Obama administration so long to negotiate his release. "He never should have been jailed and it's embarrassing that John Kerry and Obama negotiate with Iran as innocent Americans remained locked-up in prison," Huckabee said in a statement. "President Obama is a complete fool for trusting a country that's been lying, cheating, murdering and sponsoring terrorism around the globe for 37 years. Empowering Iran with sanctions relief is like Neville Chamberlain writing a $150 billion check to Adolf Hitler hoping he'll play nice and behave. This Iran deal is an insane disaster and this White House has lost its mind."
CHARLESTON, S.C. - The evangelical vote is still up for grabs in the current presidential election. No one knows this better than former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee who ran for president in 2008 and lost. He had a pretty good showing back then, surprising everyone when he won the Iowa caucuses. Comparisons of Huckabee being David who sleighed Goliath started popping up as people across the country gave him a second glance. The former Arkansas governor would have had a much better showing nationwide if evangelicals would have shown up to the polls and voted. But many Christians, unhappy with their options, stayed home… CBN's Washington Bureau Chief cut through the madness in the "spin room" to ask him about evangelicals this time around. "One of the important things is that they need to show up and vote. So many of them didn't in the last cycle in 2012 and that's probably one of the factors that cost us the election," Huckabee said. Huckabee said presidential candidates ought to address the "moral issues" of the nation and not just economic ones.
...GOP candidate Mike Huckabee was direct and to the point on the issue of abortion. The pro-life former Arkansas governor says he find's it hard to ask God to bless our nation when we permit legalized abortion that results in killing 4,000 unborn babies every day. "At the end of every political speech, most of us say, 'God bless America,'" Huckabee said. "But how can he do that when we continue to slaughter 4,000 babies a day?" Huckabee had a similar message in November. He questioned how Americans can expect God to bless America when the nation has aborted almost 60 million unborn babies.
...Straight off the Republican Debate in North Charleston Thursday Night, Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee announced he'll lead worship at Trinity Baptist. The Cayce Church service is set for this Sunday at 9:30 a.m. According to Huckabee's 2016 Presidential Campaign, the former Southern Baptist pastor will also play with the Church Choir and Praise Band during the service's first song.
NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C.—Mike Huckabee has closed...with an appeal for prayer and protection of the unborn...As president, Huckabee said he would treat the unborn as persons under the Constitution. Huckabee also quoted an elderly Texan who remembered when there was prayer and the 10 Commandments in schools. The GOP presidential hopeful said the nation will be better off if "we unapologetically get on our knees before we get on our feet."
...Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee echoed Trump's sentiments during a South Carolina tea party convention, saying that while "it's great" that the prisoners have been freed, "they should've been released before we ever sat down at the negotiating table." "They've been there more than a year too long," Huckabee said to reporters Saturday. "Actually they've been there several years too long."
Huckabee was asked if he thinks Trump is now sincere in what he says. "I have no reason to doubt him. He's pretty outspoken, you got to give him credit for that." Huckabee went on to criticize Cruz, although not by name. "If you want to talk about a candidate whose switched positions you got a bunch of them out there who changed themselves on Trans Pacific Partnership, on ethanol and on foreign policy and all over the board. So you know, Donald Trump's positions if they changed, they changed over 15 years not the last 15 minutes." Huckabee, Cruz, and TruGrab your
