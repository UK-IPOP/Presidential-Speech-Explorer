"While President Obama has spent the last three years punishing job creators, he's been busy showering taxpayer dollars on his political allies and donors, like those involved in the Solyndra fiasco. After job losses and billions of dollars wasted, the results are clear – President Obama's allies won while job creators and millions of struggling Americans have lost." –Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson

 "The Department of Energy's inspector general, Gregory Friedman, who was not a political appointee, chastised the alternative-energy loan and grant programs for their absence of 'sufficient transparency and accountability.'
