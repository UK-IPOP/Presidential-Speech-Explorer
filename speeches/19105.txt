WITH, I am sure, millions of Americans I applaud the House of Representatives for its vote today in support of the Landrum-Griffin Labor Reform Bill which would deal effectively with the abuses disclosed by the McClellan Committee. I congratulate all those who voted in support of this legislation.
This action gives cause for real hope that the Congress will ultimately pass a good Labor Reform Bill.
