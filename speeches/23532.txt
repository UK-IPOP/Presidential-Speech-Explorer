YOUR MAJESTY, I want to express on behalf of the people of the United States, on behalf of the Government, and on my own behalf, our great pleasure and satisfaction in welcoming you again to the United States.
You have been here on several occasions before, on the occasion of a state visit in 1957 during my predecessor's term of office, and it is a source of satisfaction to welcome you here again.
Relations between your country and this country have been close and cordial, and it is my hope that as a result of your visit here to Washington on this occasion, that those relations will become even closer during the days and years to come.
So, Your Majesty, I can assure you of a warm welcome here in Washington and in the United States--to you--to the members of your family who accompany you--to the members of your government.
And we express the hope that this visit will be only one of a series which will mark ever increasingly intimate relations between Saudi Arabia and the United States.
Your Majesty, you are most welcome here.
