 Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced the Romney for President New Hampshire Law Enforcement Leadership Team comprised of 23 law enforcement leaders, including three county Sheriffs. The New Hampshire Law Enforcement Leadership Team will play an important role in helping to spread Governor Romney's message of strong, principled leadership throughout the State.
"We rely on law enforcement officers to protect us and our families every day, and this brave group has proven time and again their commitment to their communities," said Governor Romney. "They understand the importance of providing our families a future in an America where we are safe from terrorism, and our children are safe from predators. I look forward to working with them to make that vision a reality."
Romney for President New Hampshire State Director Jim Merrill said, "Law enforcement officers from across the Granite State have come together to support Governor Romney because he is the candidate with the experience, vision and values to lead our nation. The members of the New Hampshire Law Enforcement Leadership Team will work to advance our agenda to bring conservative change to Washington, to keep our families safe and to protect our country."
