ARLINGTON, VA -- Today, McCain-Palin 2008 released its latest web ad, entitled "The Coal Miner." The ad highlights Joe Biden's recent comment that the Obama-Biden ticket is anti-coal and anti-clean coal. While John McCain supports an "all of the above" energy policy to achieve strategic energy independence, Barack Obama and Joe Biden continue to take options off the table, including now coal.
 That must be why he said. 
 "I'm a hard-coal miner, anthracite coal, Scranton, PA." 
 Obama + Biden. Ready to Pander? Yes. Ready to Lead? No.
