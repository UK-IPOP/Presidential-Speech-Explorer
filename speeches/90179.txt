 Today, Romney for President announced the D.C. Chapter of Young Professionals for Mitt â€“ the first chapter of Governor Romney's efforts to involve young professionals in his 2008 presidential campaign. Serving as Co-Chairs of the D.C. Chapter will be Alex Annett of Patton Boggs and Drew Maloney of Ogilvy Government Relations.
"Young Professionals for Mitt will be our flagship organization for reaching out to voters who are just beginning their careers. In each of their professions, they are driving forces for new and innovative ideas. With their help, they will be a driving force behind our campaign as we continue building support across the nation," said Governor Romney.
With today's announcement, Alex Annett said, "As young professionals, we are impressed with Governor Romney's pro-growth record and agenda. He has balanced budgets, promoted entrepreneurship and transformed institutions. He creates change and change is what Washington needs."
Joining his fellow Co-Chair, Drew Maloney said, "We are looking forward to helping Governor Romney raise the resources he needs to continue building his strong national organization."
Over the coming weeks, Romney for President will announce several new Young Professionals for Mitt chapters across the country.
