"America can't afford to continue down the path President Obama has set, facing even more deficits and crippling tax hikes that will prevent recovery and destroy jobs. Mitt Romney has proposed a comprehensive plan that will rein in government spending, reform entitlements, and put us on a path toward more jobs and more take-home pay." —Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 Mitt Romney's goal is to put the federal government on a course toward a balanced budget and true fiscal responsibility.
 Mitt knows that our economic future—along with the future of entitlement programs—depends on fundamental reform.
