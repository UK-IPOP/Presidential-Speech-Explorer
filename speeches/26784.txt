THIS ACT, one of the significant achievements of the administration and the 90th Congress, will greatly contribute to the Nation's ability to solve one of the key problems of education: the development and enlistment of better equipped teachers for our schools and colleges. Teachers are central to the role of education in our country. And education is the very base of an informed and strong Nation.
