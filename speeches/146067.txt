Pool was ushered into the VP's ceremonial office at 2:44 p.m. for former Senator Jeff Flake's ceremonial swearing in as ambassador to Turkey.
The swearing in is scheduled for 3:00 p.m. ET.
Vice President Harris came in at 3:03 pm. Flake followed. Cheryl Flake accompanied him and held the Bible as the Ambassador Flake was sworn in.
Pool was reminded by WH that Flake technically was made an ambassador a few days ago but he was ceremonially sworn in today.
The White House relays these guests were in attendance:
Cheryl Flake, spouse
Chandler Morse, friend and former Senate Chief of Staff
Colleen Donnelly, friend and former Senate Foreign Affairs Legislative Aide
VP responded to one question on the Texas SCOTUS ruling. I will pass that along momentarily.
Here are the VP's remarks in response to a question from the supplemental pool:
Q: "The Biden administration promised a whole of government response to SB 8. So after DoJ's lawsuit was defeated what will the Biden administration do next?
A: "Well listen, the ruling today is an attempt to undue -in terms of what's happening in Texas in particular and around the country - 50 years of precedent. And as far as I'm concerned and as far as our administration is concerned, a woman's right to make decisions about her own body is non-negotiable. And so we will continue to fight for the constitutional right of all women to make decisions about their own body without interference by some legislative group of people that think that they can replace their judgment with hers."
