The Administration strongly supports a five year reauthorization of the Superfund program. 
. Further, the Administration strongly opposes enactment of H.R. 3852 unless it is amended to:


— 
. Such litigation would be extremely costly, impose huge burdens on the courts, and result in program priorities being set by a variety of different courts;

— 
. Establishment of a massive new Fund is not warranted when no information is available yet to determine the size of the problem that exists or whether it can be adequately dealt with under the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984; and

— 
. Funding of O&M is an inappropriate Federal role and would set a bad precedent for other Federal construction programs under which funding is a State or local responsibility.

— 
. Such schedules are unreasonable from a management standpoint and would result in serious administrative problems;

— 
. This provision will simply divert money from Superfund's primary mission, to protect human health, to low priority environmental restoration activity;

— 
 to include suits against persons responsible for releases posing an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health or the environment. This will interfere with EPA's ability to set priorities for cleanup, and will slow down cleanup efforts nation-wide.
