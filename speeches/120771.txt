Today, Governor Jeb Bush released his Veterans for Jeb Steering Committee, a group of veterans and military leaders who will be tasked with advising the South Carolina campaign on veteran's issues and encouraging veterans and their families to join the campaign and help spread Governor Bush's message. The steering committee is comprised of leaders with decades of experience in uniformed military service and veterans' affairs.
In officially welcoming them to the campaign, Governor Bush said, "It is an absolute honor to be endorsed by such a distinguished group. This group of leaders represents the best and brightest of South Carolina, and our nation. I'm proud to have their support."
Retired Major General James Livingston added, "Governor Bush's strong record on veteran's issues makes him the best choice to serve as our next Commander-in-Chief. We need a strong leader with executive experience who knows how to lead in a dangerous world while also maintaining the highest standard of care for our veterans back home. Jeb Bush is that leader."
