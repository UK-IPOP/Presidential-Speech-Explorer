The amounts provided by the bill in excess of the President's request are 
, especially 1n light of the Committee's cuts in FAA and Coast Guard operating expenses and excessive funding for mass transit and other programs. The bill:

— The Federal Government simply cannot afford these expenditures. To fully construct those projects earmarked by the Senate would cost nearly $4 billion. In addition, there is another $10 billion worth of possible projects in early stages of development.

— These projects are primarily local transportation and development projects. Federal expenditures for them are inappropriate and do not address a national need.

— Continued discretionary Federal support, especially with its relatively low local match, quite often promotes over investment in systems of highly questionable design, utility, and cost-effectiveness.
The Administration hopes that the Senate will make every effort to improve on the Committee-reported version of this bill by eliminating UMTA discretionary grants for new transit systems, reducing Federal transit grant assistance, and restoring critical FAA air traffic safety and Coast Guard law enforcement funding. The President's senior advisors could not recommend that he sign this bill in its present form.
