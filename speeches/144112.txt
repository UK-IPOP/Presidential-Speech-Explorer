Hi -- We had an embargoed background briefing ahead of the VP's first day of events in Singapore Monday. The info in this 
 summary and factsheet the VP's office sent after includes what was discussed in the briefing.

See below for the embargoed summary. A more detailed factsheet is attached -- in case it doesn't go through for you in the pool report, reach out to the VP's office for it. 


Here's the summary:



During the Vice President's meeting tomorrow with Singaporean officials, we anticipate the following topics of conversation and deliverables. See the embargoed fact sheet attached for additional information.



Motorcade departed the hotel for The Istana, the official residence of the president of Singapore, at 10:17am. We arrived at 10:24 am.

She was greeted by Lee Hsien Loong, Prime Minister of the Republic of Singapore and Major Sean Paul Magness, Singapore Commander of Honor Guard.

Harris did the hand to the chest instead of shaking hands again, as she did at the airport yesterday. It was hard to hear their exchange but the PM told Harris: "Thanks for coming across the world."

VP and PM then moved to dais and for the playing of the U.S. National Anthem followed by the Singapore National Anthem. PM was escorted by PM and the commander of the Honor Guard as they walked and reviewed Singapore troops.

(Will tweet some photos @tparti for those interested)

VP and PM then went inside the Istana at 10:33 am.

VP sat down and signed the PM's guest book in the East Drawing Room where she wrote a note that looked a few sentences long.

They then heading inside another room for the orchid ceremony. VP has a species of an orchid named after her.

She placed the placard with her name into the soil of the potted orchid, which was pinkish purple. "Kind of reminds me of the lotus flower," she said.

Pool shouted what she thought of the flower. She said "oh it's beautiful and I'm honored." She was also presented with a birth certificate for the flower. "Oh there's a birth certificate," she said with a laugh.

"Well I'm pleased to welcome this orchid into the world," she said.

Per VP's office, participants for the ceremony:

She then moved to the West Drawing Room at 10:38 for a "courtesy call" with Singapore President Halimah Yacob. Before that, she signed her guest book as well.

We are now holding for the joint presser, which will be livestreamed, so I won't be sending a readout from it.

Summary of deliverables, per VP's office:

During the Vice President's meeting tomorrow with Singaporean officials, we anticipate the following topics of conversation and deliverables. See the embargoed fact sheet attached for additional information.



The VP's joint press conference with PM Lee started at 1:37 pm in the State Room of the Istana.

Only cameras, a producer and TV audio were the only press allowed into the room because of covid restrictions. Pool participated via zoom from a room next to where the presser was held.

Harris was asked about Afghanistan a few different ways. PM Lee got asked about whether US is still a trustworthy partner and about lifting travel restrictions.

The presser wrapped at 2:13 pm. We had to run to catch the motorcade after.

Motorcade now rolling at 2:18 pm to the hotel, where we will hold/eat lunch in our rooms before heading to the Changi Naval Base.


We left the hotel at 4:21 pm and arrived at Changi naval base at 4:56 pm.

VP Harris walked into the lobby area at 4:58 pm.

Per VP's office, she was greeted by:


Harris received a briefing at the base right after. Pool held for a few minutes before being escorted in. She was briefed in a hallway area that had floor to ceiling glass windows with the view of the base and ships. The briefers had a screen showing photos and info as they presented.

Harris listened while looking out to the base and the screen. She was shown an autonomous ship and she asked a couple of questions about it, including one about piracy and terrorism and another about fuel requirements. She also asked about the timeline of their naval operations.

Once the briefing ended, VP did photos with the briefers. Pool again shouted Afghanistan questions. She didn't answer and pool was escorted back to the press van.

Participants:
- VPOTUS
- Mr. Zaqy Mohamad (Senior Minister of State for Defence)

At 5:34 pm, motorcade made the 5-minute drive to USS Tulsa, a littoral combat ship currently visiting Singapore. Pool then climbed quite a few steps to get on the ship and then a limited pool climbed some more steps to the bridge of the ship, which for those who don't know is the navigation center of the ship.

Harris entered the bridge at 5:51 pm and received a tour. She asked some questions about the navigation and at one point looked far out of the front of the ship as the briefer, LT Katie Canant, pointed at something (pool couldn't hear).

"This is impressive," she said. 


At 6:22 pm, Harris began delivering remarks in front of U.S. sailors aboard the ship. Harris spoke with the backdrop of the American flag on the hangar bay of the ship. Her remarks covered Afghanistan and the U.S. objective in the Indo-Pacific. As you will see, she stressed "free and open" several times."

Quotes below (with Afghanistan in bold):

"It's good to see you guys," Harris said, opening remarks by talking about how proud she was to talk about the sailors aboard USS Tulsa with the PM earlier today.

"It's about what you all do here, what you do every day, the sacrifices that you have made, that your family makes for you to serve that allow us then me as your vice president the president, we as a country to engage in these relationships for the benefit not only the United States but frankly the world, so I'm here first of all, to say thank you."

"It's great to be with you in person. So I can again say thank you for your service and for your courage, and for your commitment and for representing the best ideals of our great country.





She then pivoted back to Indo-Pacific:

"At the same time. At the same time, other missions continue all around the world. So you all are here in Singapore, and Southeast Asia, and the Indo Pacific, with the mission of your own, a mission that is vital to the American people."

"And the reason we are here is important. The Indo Pacific is critical to the security and the prosperity of the United States. I do believe a big part of the history of the 21st century will be written about this very region where you now serve. And we want to be the ones who are helping to shape and dictate that history. You in your service are going to be the ones who helped shape that history."

"Our presence in the Indo Pacific has a long, long history, including them, of helping to guarantee peace and security, freedom of trade and commerce, freedom of navigation and to say that again, freedom of navigation and open waterways, and the rules based international order that has brought so much, safety and prosperity to so many."

"American workers, let's think about the folks at home, people we know members of our family. American working families and people rely on the waters that you all fail to provide for their families, American businesses rely on the ports that you dock in to get their markets to get their goods to market to buy the things they need."

"President Biden and I know that our country has deep and enduring strategic interests here in this region, which is why our security presence matters. And it is why our partnerships here matter. And it is why your mission matters."

It is in our vital interest to stand united with our allies and our partners in Southeast Asia, in defense of a free and open Indo Pacific--free and open.

"Free and open. This is the work you are doing... want you to know that each and every one of you. No matter your rank or title is advancing American interests, and protecting the American people. Our nation is stronger. And it is safer because of you. Because of your sacrifice. And because of your service."

Her remarks ended at 6:31 pm. The sailors aboard applauded. Motorcade now rolling at 6:39 back to RON. Will tweet some pics from the ship (@tparti).

Below is some info from the VP's office:



The Vice President is at the Changi Naval Base. This visit will demonstrate our close security partnership and our appreciation for Singaporean support of U.S. force posture in the region.
