IT IS WITH pleasure that I have today signed S. 44, authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to construct in California the San Luis Unit of the Central Valley Project and to enter into an agreement with the State of California with respect to its financing, construction and operation in order that there may be a joint Federal-State use of the San Luis Reservoir site. This legislation culminates cooperative Federal and State efforts which began five years ago. It constitutes a unique achievement in the field of water development and conservation and is consistent with the Administration's philosophy of partnership and teamwork in this field.
Negotiation of the agreement between the State and Federal agencies should be undertaken immediately and concluded with dispatch. It is my earnest hope that these negotiations will insure a clear-cut understanding of responsibilities and the early undertaking of this mutually advantageous Federal-State partnership in water development.
