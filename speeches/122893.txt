We have a national security interest in making sure Israel is strong, and we have a moral obligation to keep the promise made in the wake of the Holocaust for a safe and secure nation for the Jewish people.
Sadly, even as Israelis are facing daily Palestinian terrorist attacks, that commitment to Israel has been lacking from the current administration.
Israel deserves our support and respect. If we are perceived as not standing with Israel, what realistically could any of our other allies expect from us? It's time to reaffirm our commitment to Israel's continued strength and prosperity.
