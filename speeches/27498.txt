Dear Dr. Wilson:
Thank you very much for your report on the summer education programs for disadvantaged children.
I am directing that copies be made available to members of the Executive, the Congress, and to school authorities throughout the country. This report is a challenge to local officials and educators to plan more wisely, work harder to reach the seriously disadvantaged, and to train the best teachers to work with the children of the poor. I hope this document will be used as a blueprint for higher achievement.
Please convey my appreciation to the members of the National Advisory Council.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Dr. O. Meredith Wilson, Chairman, National Advisory Council on the Education of Disadvantaged Children]
