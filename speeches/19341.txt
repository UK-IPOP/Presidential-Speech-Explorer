I HAVE just learned of the sudden and tragic passing of J. Ernest Wilkins. As former Assistant Secretary of Labor for International Labor Affairs and as a Member of the Civil Rights Commission, Mr. Wilkins was a gifted and dedicated public servant who contributed much to the public welfare of our country.
Mrs. Eisenhower and I extend our deepest sympathies to his family.
