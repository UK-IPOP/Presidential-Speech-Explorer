I HAVE RECEIVED your kind message of appreciation for the assistance rendered by the armed forces of the United States in the redeployment of the armed forces of the Republic of China from the Tachen Islands.
The manner in which this cooperative endeavor was carried out is a source of real gratification to me and, I am sure, of mutual satisfaction to the officers and men, both Chinese and American, who were responsible for its success. They may justly take pride in having participated in this demonstration of the close and effective cooperation of our two countries in the interests of peace and the defense of freedom.
