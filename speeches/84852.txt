 The emergency funds would support the immediate needs of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Department of Defense (DoD), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and other Federal government agencies in their relief and recovery missions. These additional funds will ensure that life-saving, life-sustaining, and recovery activities continue unhindered.
 These activities respond to the immediate needs of evacuees, continue response and recovery, and begin repairs urgently needed by local government facilities such as schools and other public buildings and utilities. Specific actions and services to be funded by this request include ongoing food, shelter, and medical care for evacuees.
