I AM particularly pleased to announce Mr. Driver's appointment since he is the first career official to administer the affairs of America's veterans. He is being promoted to this important position on the basis of outstanding achievement and demonstrated ability over a period of 16 years in the Veterans Administration.
I hope that the recognition accorded Mr. Driver for his effective and dedicated service will serve as an example to others in Government service. In the search for talent in this administration, I will fully consider the records of those who have made Government service their career as well as outstanding men and women in other walks of life.
