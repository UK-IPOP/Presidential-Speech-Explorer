 "Both responses by McCain have this in common -- they fail entirely to address the substance of Romney's criticism. The reason, of course, is that McCain has no good response. He did oppose tax cuts, support for which does lie at the essence of Reagan conservatism. Similarly, he did support comprehensive immigration reform and his line on that support now is a grudging acknowledgement that the American people (though not necessarily McCain) want border security first."

 SEN. JOHN MCCAIN: "If there's any doubt that we're doing well, it's when Mitt Romney starts attacking." (

 "'I begin the ad by indicating he's an honorable man,' Mr. Romney said. 'I believe he is a good person. I make no attacks on his character, no attacks of a personal nature whatsoever. I've just seen the text of his ad. It's obviously of a very different nature. It's an attack ad. It attacks me personally. It's nasty. It's mean-spirited. Frankly, it tells you more about Senator McCain than it does about me that he'd run an ad like that.'" (Marc Santora, "McCain Ad: Right Back At Ya, Mitt,"

 SEN. MCCAIN: "I guess it was bound to happen. Governor Bush's campaign is getting desperate, with a negative ad about me. The fact is, I'll use the surplus money to fix Social Security, cut your taxes and pay down the debt. Governor Bush uses all of the surplus for tax cuts, with not one new penny for Social Security or the debt. His ad twists the truth like Clinton. We're all pretty tired of that. As president, I'll be conservative and always tell you the truth. No matter what." (McCain 2000, Campaign Ad, 2/9/00)
 
 "'It's reminiscent of what he did against George W. Bush in 2000, which as you recall, he accused President Bush of twisting the truth like Bill Clinton,' he said. 'Again, this is the kind of nasty, personal attack, which really doesn't have a place in this process.'" (Marc Santora, "McCain Ad: Right Back At Ya, Mitt,"

 "The McCain plan -- which is being put forward in the U.S. House by Arizona GOP Congressmen Jeff Flake and Jim Kolbe -- allows the 11 million illegal immigrants already in the U.S. to stay in the country if they apply for legal status and pay a $2,000 fine."

 "[McCain] has also teamed up with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (Mass.), a liberal Democrat, on an immigration bill that many conservatives despise. 'It would have legalized and provided a path for citizenship, which is amnesty, for 66.1 million people,' said Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), who has called Kennedy and McCain 'amnesty mercenaries.'"

 "Sens. John McCain and Ted Kennedy have a bill that, surprise, includes a generous guest worker program that would encourage border jumping. Illegals who register would have to pay a fine and taxes, but they would get to stay here and apply for permanent residency. That sure beats waiting at the border and hoping to be let in."
