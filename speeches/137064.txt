Good morning and Happy New Year!
It is a sunny 66 degrees in Palm Beach. The presidential motorcade departed Mar-a-Lago at 9:49 AM for an undisclosed location. The pool has not seen POTUS today.
The president's motorcade arrived at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach at 9:57 AM. The pool is now holding in the parking lot of the library across the street.
Your pooler has asked for details on the president's activities today and will pass along any information.
The president's motorcade arrived back at Mar-a-Lago at 3:41 PM. We have not received any additional information about the president's activities today.
Close to Mar-a-Lago the motorcade passed a number of people protesting plans to ban some flavored e-cigarettes, with signs that said "Don't ban my vape" and "Freedom to Vape." Many were wearing t-shirts that said "we vape, we vote." It also passed a crowd of Trump supporters waving signs that said "We heart Trump" and "Trump 2020" as well as a number of anti-Trump signs, including one that said "Russian stooge."
At 3:48 PM we have a travel/photo lid. Thanks to co-pooler Seung Min Kim and to Nikki Schwab for their help. Enjoy the rest of your day.
