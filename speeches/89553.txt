 The President also announced his intention to double the initial $15 billion commitment, already the largest international health initiative dedicated to a specific disease. Assuming Congress meets the President's request for Fiscal Year 2008, and with the new $30 billion proposal, the American people have committed $48.3 billion across 10 years to fight HIV/AIDS.
 – HIV/AIDS treatment, prevention and care are life-long needs, and the American people will continue to support those served during PEPFAR's first 5 years.
 –PEPFAR will further expand efforts to strengthen health systems, and to leverage programs that address malaria, tuberculosis, child and maternal health, clean water, food and nutrition, education and other needs. The Plan will emphasize transitioning from an emergency to a sustainable response for treatment, prevention and care.
 HIV/AIDS is a global crisis that requires a global response. The U.S. currently provides as many resources for global HIV/AIDS as all other developed country governments combined for global HIV/AIDS. But only together can we turn the tide against the global epidemic.
President Bush announced PEPFAR in his 2003 State of the Union Address and signed the initial 5-year, $15 billion authorizing legislation that was approved with strong bipartisan support. Authorization for PEPFAR expires at the end of Fiscal Year 2008. Reauthorization is needed this year to secure America's preeminent leadership role, to assure the world and our partners of our commitment so rapid scale-up continues, and to provide time to implement novel aspects of the new Plan.
