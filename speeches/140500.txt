"President Trump's Administration took action last year to expand short-term, limited-duration plans, giving Americans more access to plans that fit their needs. Subject to State regulation, these plans can be offered for up to 364 days and renewed for up to 36 months after the Obama Administration limited them to 3 months. Short-term health plans are a particularly attractive option for the nearly 30 million uninsured people with gaps in employment, and those most hurt by rising premiums. Short-term health plans typically cost less than half of the cost of Obamacare plans." ("President Donald J. Trump's Healthcare Actions To Expand Choices And Lower Costs Are Producing Real Results,"

"Last year, the Administration introduced a second pathway for employers to join together to form Association Health Plans and provide more affordable health coverage to employees. A new report found that 28 AHPs have formed already, with more under development, and offer coverage similar to employer-based coverage. Some AHPs show up to 30 percent savings on premiums."

"President Donald J. Trump is expanding Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRAs), opening new coverage options for American workers. The Trump Administration has finalized a rule to expand HRAs, giving businesses a better way to offer health insurance coverage. Under the rule, employers will be able to provide their workers with tax-preferred funds to pay for the cost of health insurance coverage that workers purchase in the individual market. This rule will particularly benefit small businesses that face significant costs in offering a traditional group health plan and businesses that do not currently offer coverage."

"President Trump's historic tax reform legislation removed the burdensome individual mandate tax penalty. Obamacare's individual mandate coerced people into buying health insurance they did not want and burdened taxpayers because the plans are so heavily subsidized." (Fact Sheets, "President Donald J.

"This week, Congress did away with another unpopular provision: the law's Independent Payment Advisory Board. The IPAB, which has been unfairly labeled a rationing board or 'death panel,' was designed to help tame runaway Medicare costs, should they ever arise." (Margot Sanger-Katz, "Another Of Obamacare's Unloved Provisions Is Gone," 
, 2/9/18)

"But the idea was never particularly popular, even in the Congress that voted for it. The IPAB would have taken away Congress's power to make the cost-saving choices it wanted â€” or its choice to avoid them." (Margot Sanger-Katz, "Another Of Obamacare's Unloved Provisions Is Gone," 
, 2/9/18)



 "You can be forgiven for not having noticed, but at the tail end of 2019, Congress repealed three significant components of Obamacare. The three repealed provisions were all taxes, each of which was included in the initial legislation as a way of raising revenue to pay for the hundreds of billions in spending the law called for."
