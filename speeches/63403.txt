 Mr. President, are you prepared to deliver your affirmative action review next Wednesday, as has been speculated?
 What date is that?
 The 19th. [

 I believe that's the day we're going to do it.
 Have you already reached a conclusion? Are you going to brief these Members today on what your thoughts are dealing with affirmative action?
 I'm going to deal with their agenda today. I'm here and I'm listening to them and they're going to go through an agenda and I'm going to respond to it.
 Any further word on Boris Yeltsin and how that might impact on U.S.-Russian relations?
 No. I got another report after this morning's meeting with congressional leadership, and our latest report is that he seems to be resting well and feeling pretty good and making some decisions from the hospital. That's the latest report I gotâ€”is about 30 minutes ago.
