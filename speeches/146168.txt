Following the House passage of the Build Back Better Act, young leaders applauded how the historic legislation will invest in a brighter, more equitable future for young people, and make it easier for American families to break into the middle class while lowering costs, creating good-paying, union jobs, and dealing everybody into the economy.
As Nobel Prize-winning economists and independent ratings agencies have confirmed, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Build Back Better Act are fully paid for, will reduce the deficit, and ease inflationary pressures by making the wealthiest individuals and corporations pay their fair share and stopping them from cheating on their tax bills.
Young leaders from across the country are applauding the passage of the historic legislation through the House and call on the Senate to take urgent action so President Biden can sign it into law and ensure we can build back better.

 "It is time for serious, historic climate action. We know that we do not have time to waste; our neighbors are suffering from the weight of climate change now, and our future is in danger. We also know that we cannot address climate change without addressing interconnected concerns like racial and economic injustice, and so we are pleased that the Build Back Better Act would target 40% of investments in communities on the frontlines of climate change and also includes a new Civilian Climate Corps. While the price tag of this vital bill may seem large, it truly pales in comparison to the steep price tag of inaction. This year alone, climate-fueled extreme weather has cost our economy a record-breaking $105 billion in property and infrastructure damage and over 500 lives lost. We cannot afford to ignore climate change any longer. Once signed into law, Build Back Better will create jobs, improve the economy, and build more resilient communities, all while addressing the climate crisisâ€¦ As the Build Back Better Act heads to the Senate for consideration, we urge senators to fulfill their moral responsibility to boldly address the climate crisis and to stop playing political football with our future. It is time for climate justice. Young people are watching, and we will not accept anything less." [
