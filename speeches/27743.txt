WE MUST become the managers of change. The private enterprise system is facing new challenges on every front. Corporations are being called upon increasingly to help provide solutions to complex national, social, and economic problems. Business, labor, and government must work in partnership for the public good.
Plans must be made now to make the most of the opportunities ahead. I feel it is time for key leaders with an interest in our industrial society to take a long range look and develop policies that will help shape that future. It is for .this reason that I am calling this White House Conference.
