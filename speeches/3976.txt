I transmit the report * of the Secretary of State in compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the 5th ultimo.
It is presumed that the omission from the resolution of the usual clause giving the Executive a discretion in its answer was accidental, and as there does not appear to be anything in the accompanying papers which upon public considerations should require them to be withheld, they are communicated accordingly.
FRANKLIN PIERCE.
