"Today's weak jobs report is devastating news for American workers and American families. This week has seen a cascade of one bad piece of economic news after another. Slowing GDP growth, plunging consumer confidence, an increase in unemployment claims, and now another dismal jobs report all stand as a harsh indictment of the President's handling of the economy. It is now clear to everyone that President Obama's policies have failed to achieve their goals and that the Obama economy is crushing America's middle class. The President's re-election slogan may be 'forward,' but it seems like we've been moving backward. We can do so much better in America. That's why I'm running for president." â€“Mitt Romney

 "The May jobs report looks uniformly bad, and with March and April jobs gains both revised lower, the numbers show a labor market in deep trouble through the spring." (Kathleen Madigan, "Can't Put Lipstick On This Pig,"

 "U.S. employers created 69,000 jobs in May, the fewest in a year, and the unemployment rate ticked up. The dismal jobs figures could fan fears that the economy is sputtering." (Christopher Rugaber, "U.S. Employers Added 69,000 Jobs In May As The Unemployment Rate Rose To 8.2 Percent,"

 "The nation's economy grew at a slower pace than previously reported in the first three months of this year, raising new concerns about economic weakness. Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the nation's economic health, grew at an annual rate of 1.9% in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said Thursday. The rate was lowered from the 2.2% growth rate originally reported in April, and significantly slower than the 3% growth rate in the final three months of last year. The current growth rate is widely considered to be weak." (Chris Isidore, "U.S. GDP Grows At 1.9% Annual Rate In 1st Quarter,"

 "New unemployment claims jumped unexpectedly last week, indicating a pickup in layoffs, a worrisome sign ahead of Friday's jobs report for May. Adding to the dreary economic news, the government said in a separate report Thursday that U.S. gross domestic product grew at a slower pace in the first quarter than previously thought."

 "The Conference Board, a private research group, said on Tuesday that its Consumer Confidence Index now stands at 64.9, down from a revised 68.7 in April. The May figure, which represents the biggest drop since October 2011 when the measure fell about 6 points, shows that consumers need more encouraging news before their concerns start to dissipate."
