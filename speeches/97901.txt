 ROBIN ROBERTS: "Very important debate for him last night. And it was his best debate?" GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: "Clearly. Best of the three debates. especially at the beginning when he did introduce Joe the Plumber and put Barack Obama on the defensive on issues like taxes, especially taxes and the economy. Also laid out his plan for buying up those bad home loans. I think his first half hour was very, very strong." (ABC's "Good Morning America," 10/16/08) 
 "Wednesday night John McCain put a dent in the Obama persona. There's no doubt that out of all the debates this fall, John McCain had his best one at Hofstra University. He was able to pokes some holes in Obama's armor. He nicked him with Ayers, ACORN, public financing, negative advertising, abortion and yes, Joe the Plumber." (David Brody, "McCain Dings Obama At Hofstra Debate," Christian Broadcasting Network's "Brody File" Blog, 10/16/08) 
 "The 'Joe the Plumber' moments were probably some of McCain's best moments. Not only was McCain able to use the Joe the Plumber story as an example of class warfare, he also used Joe as a way to make the economy a personal story." (David Brody, "McCain Dings Obama At Hofstra Debate," Christian Broadcasting Network's "Brody File" Blog, 10/16/08) 
 "Clearly, the line of the night was when McCain's distanced himself from the President by saying: I'm sure a lot of McCain supporters thought 'It's about time'. Obama has been hammering McCain on his ties to Bush forever but Wednesday night McCain not only delivered the big line but also listed numerous examples of how he is different than President Bush." (David Brody, "McCain Dings Obama At Hofstra Debate," Christian Broadcasting Network's "Brody File" Blog, 10/16/08) 
 "Senator John McCain was in a groove early in the presidential debate on Wednesday night, looking Senator Barack Obama in the eye and chiding him over taxes, over his backbone in standing up to Democrats and over the Obama campaign's portrayal of Mr. McCain as the second coming of George W. Bush." (Patrick Healy, "Pressing All The Buttons, McCain Attacks, But Obama Stays Steady,"

 "The winner, and in my view quite decisively, was John McCain. From the very first question, McCain seemed certain of himself and his answers." (Stephen Hayes, "McCain Wins Round Three,"

 (Byron York, Op-Ed, "'I Am Not President Bush.'" 
, 10/16/08) 
 "On issue after issue, McCain made his case, deftly countering Obama's jabs. Why, he asked, does Obama 'always say we have to spend more?' Added McCain: 'Throwing money at every problem is not the answer.'" (Editorial, "Lessons From The Plumber," 
, 10/16/08) 
 "With an assist from Joe the Plumber, John McCain delivered the best debate performance of his campaign last night. And it was probably the best night of the entire general election so far for him, rivaled only by the electric evening on which Sarah Palin gave her acceptance speech during the GOP convention last month." (Charles Hurt, "Old Warrior Finally Has His Great Debate," 
, 10/16/08) 
 "McCain last night made the strongest and most convincing argument yet that he is prepared to keep the federal government from making the current economic crisis even worse." (Charles Hurt, "Old Warrior Finally Has His Great Debate," 
, 10/16/08) 
 
 "So the Republican's tone was crisper, sharper and more cutting than it had been in the first two debates. He kept Obama on the defensive for much of the 90-minute forum, attacking him for everything from his association with '60s radical Bill Ayers to his decision not to take public financing for his campaign." (Editorial, "Analysis: McCain More Cutting; Obama Low-Key," 
, 10/16/08) 
 "On Wednesday, Joe, you saw Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain making their cases, seated uncomfortably close, without the distraction of a town hall. It wasn't Obama's night." (Joanne Ostrow, Op-Ed, "McCain Seemed Energized; Obama Kept Cool,"
