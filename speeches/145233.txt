Pool Reports by 
, 
Good morning from Wilmington, Del., where it is sunny and 43 degrees.
Your pool, COVID-tested, assembled as scheduled for noon and has loaded into the van. Van moving at 12:05 p.m.
There is not yet any official word on our destination but for general informational purposes, your pooler notes the following:
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said at Friday's briefing that POTUS was traveling to Delaware for "the memorial service of a family member."
It seems likely that the decedent may be Joan Olivere (n√©e Berger), the mother of Beau Biden's widow, Hallie.
Ms. Olivere died on Feb. 20, aged 76.
A full obituary of Ms. Olivere can be found on the website of The (Wilmington) News Journal, here:
Your pooler reached out to the WH a short time ago for confirmation on this but has heard nothing back yet.
Will update in due course.
Passing along from the White House
