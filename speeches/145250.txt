Pool Reports by 
, 
Good morning from a chilly (34 degrees) but sunny Wilmington.
For your general planning awareness, the pool's call time has been pushed back to 3:30 p.m.
No other news at this point.
The pool arrived at its holding spot adjacent to the Biden family residence at 3:57 p.m.
Pool was COVID-tested at the hotel this morning and will, presumably, be security-swept soon.
I will update as soon as there is further movement.
Pool van has joined up with the presidential motorcade, and we are rolling at 5:04p.m.
The motorcade has arrived at St. Joseph on the Brandywine Roman Catholic Church.
The President walked into the church at 5:08 p.m.
The President exited the church at 5:50 p.m. and paused for a conversation of about one minute's duration with a priest.
He moved on and had another, even briefer, conversation with an unidentified man in regular, i.e. non-religious, clothes.
Both conversations were way beyond earshot of the pool.
Motorcade is rolling again at 5:54 p.m.
The motorcade arrived back at the Biden residence without incident, and a travel/photo lid was immediately called at 5:58 p.m.
Enjoy your evening, everyone.
