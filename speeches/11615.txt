 pursuant to section 336 of Title III. Part II, of the Tariff Act of 1930 (46 Stat. 590, 701), the United States Tariff Commission has investigated the differences in costs of production of, and all other facts and conditions enumerated in said section with respect to, crab meat, fresh or frozen (whether or not packed in ice), or prepared or preserved in any manner, including crab paste and crab sauce, being wholly or in part the growth or product of the United States, and of and with respect to like or similar articles wholly or In part the growth or product of the principal competing country; and
 in the course of the investigation hearings were held, of which reasonable public notice was given and at which parties interested were given reasonable opportunity to be present, to produce evidence, and to be heard; and
 the Commission has reported to the President the results of the investigation and its findings with respect to such differences in costs of production; and
 the Commission has found it shown by the investigation that the principal competing country is Japan, and that the duty expressly fixed by statute does not equalize the difference in the costs of production of crab meat, prepared or preserved in any manner, including crab paste and crab sauce, packed in air-tight containers, wholly or in part the growth or product of the United States, and the like or similar foreign articles when produced in the principal competing country, and has specified in its report the increase in the rate of duty expressly fixed by statute found by the Commission to be shown by the investigation to be necessary to equalize such difference; and
 in the judgment of the President such rate of duty is shown by the investigation of the Tariff Commission to be necessary to equalize such difference in costs of production:
 President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 336 (c), Title III, Part II of the said act, do hereby approve and proclaim an increase in the rate of duty expressly fixed in paragraph 721 (a) of Title I of the said act on crab meat, prepared or preserved in any manner, including crab paste and crab sauce, packed in air-tight containers, from 15 per centum ad valorem to 22-Â½ per centum ad valorem, the rate found to be shown by the investigation to be necessary to equalize such difference in costs of production.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 22nd day of August in the year of our Lord, nineteen hundred and forty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-sixth.
