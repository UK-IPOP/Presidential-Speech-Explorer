IN RESPONSE to your official request, joined by Mayor Cavanagh, that federal troops be sent to assist local and state police and the 8000 Michigan National Guardsmen under your command, and on the basis of your representation that there is reasonable doubt that you can maintain law and order in Detroit, I have directed the troops. you requested to proceed at once to Selfridge Air Force Base, Michigan. There they will be available for immediate deployment as required to support and assist police and the Michigan National Guard forces. These federal troops will arrive at Selfridge this afternoon. Immediately, I have instructed Cyrus Vance, Special Assistant to Secretary of Defense McNamara, to proceed to Detroit for conferences with you and to make specific plans for providing you with such support and assistance as may be necessary.
