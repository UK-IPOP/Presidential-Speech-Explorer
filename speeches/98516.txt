 U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today announced its John McCain for President Tennessee Statewide Leadership. This distinguished team of leaders will direct Tennessee's growing grassroots organization and communicate John McCain's message of peace, prosperity and reform.
"I first met John McCain when he became the Navy's liaison to the United States Senate when I was Republican Leader," said former Senator and McCain Honorary State Chair Howard Baker. "He traveled abroad with me on many occasions, and I had the opportunity to observe first-hand his ability to relate with foreign leaders. I have a high regard, respect and confidence in his unique ability to lead our country as our next president."
"The Volunteer State is uniting behind John McCain because he has the judgment, integrity and experience to lead," added State Representative and Tennessee McCain Co-Chair Beth Harwell.
John McCain thanked the Tennessee leadership, saying, "Former Senator Baker and I have been friends and colleagues for many years; his guidance and leadership will be a tremendous asset to my campaign. I am also very grateful for the support of our entire Tennessee team, and I am confident their hard work and efforts will result in victory on November 4th."
