To the Congress of the United States:
Pursuant to the first paragraph under the heading "Department of Commerce" of the Supplemental Appropriation Act, 1958, there is submitted herewith my report recommending a site for a new public airport in the vicinity of the District of Columbia.
Such report consists of a letter to me from the Special Assistant to the President for aviation matters, dated January 8, 1958, together with an enclosure entitled "Site Selection Study". It proposes the site known as Chantilly, located partly in Loudoun County and partly in Fairfax County, Virginia, as the airport site which best meets the requirements of public safety, airport and airspace capacity, public service and cost.
Accordingly, I recommend the selection of the Chantilly site, and at this site have directed the Civil Aeronautics Administration to proceed forthwith with the construction and development of a new public airport to serve the growing needs of the National Capital region.
