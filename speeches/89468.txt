The Clinton Campaign announced the endorsements of Congressmen Henry Cuellar and Ruben Hinojosa and more than 50 Texas officials and community leaders.
"Senator Clinton is the only candidate with the experience and toughness to hit the ground running on her first day in the White House," Rep. Cuellar said.
"Hillary Clinton is a tested and visionary leader who won't forget about the people of South Texas when she reaches the White House," Rep. Hinojosa said. "Her commitment to expanding educational and economic opportunities for all Americans is unmatched."
"I enthusiastically endorse Hillary Clinton for President of the United States of America," said Carol Alvarado, Houston City Councilwoman and President of the Texas Municipal League. "Hillary has an outstanding record of supporting and including Latinas in the political process. As a Latina leader, I am proud to lend my support to a great American who will be a forceful advocate for my community."
"I am honored to have the support of so many local leaders from across Texas," Clinton said. "With their help, we'll take our message of change across the Lone Star State."
Today's endorsers join Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee in supporting Hillary, and illustrate her growing support in the Lone Star State. Yesterday, a poll by the nonpartisan Texas Lyceum found that Clinton is tied with the top GOP contenders in head-to-head matchups and could put Texas in play in a general election.
