The Administration objects to the Committee's reductions in funding for high priority overseas projects. The bill would:

The Administration is concerned that the Committee's $150 million reduction to the $2,184 million requested for base realignment and closure would likely delay cleanup of the bases. Deletion of $30 million requested for Air Force storage tank and hydrant fuel distribution system projects could result in noncompliance with environmental laws.

The Administration objects to the Committee's addition of $51.4 million for an unrequested replacement hospital at Fitzsimons Army Medical Center, Denver, Colorado â€” a community with an estimated excess health care capacity of 40 percent. The hospital could cost up to $400 million to complete.

H.R. 5428 also contains objectionable language provisions:

On the basis of OMB's initial scoring of the bill, the Committee recommendations are within the House 602(b) allocations for military construction activities. In aggregate, the House 602(b) allocations are consistent with the statutory spending limits mandated by the Budget Enforcement Act.

Attached is a table that reflects preliminary OMB scoring of the Committee bill.
