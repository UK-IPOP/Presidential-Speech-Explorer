 
 President and Mrs. Bush and other world leaders concluded the three-day G-8 Summit, which was hosted by German Chancellor Merkel. At the Summit, G-8 leaders demonstrated their commitment to work with Africa to facilitate opportunity and conflict resolution and to combat the scourge of infectious diseases.
 The President will work with Congress to reauthorize the President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and double the initial $15 billion commitment, already the largest international health initiative dedicated to a specific disease. Assuming Congress meets the President's request for Fiscal Year 2008, and with the new $30 billion plan, the American people have committed $48.3 billion across 10 years to fight global HIV/AIDS.
 President Bush announced the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) in June 2005. A five-year, $1.2 billion program, PMI challenges the private sector to join the U.S. government in combating malaria, with the goal of cutting malaria's mortality rate by 50 percent in these target countries, freeing these African nations and their citizens from the grip of debilitating disease.
 This initiative is expected to mobilize up to $1 billion in privately-managed investment funds for Africa and provide expert technical assistance specifically tailored to help address structural impediments in Africa's financial sector.
 The President will work closely with Congress to provide an additional $525 million over five years to promote the full development of human potential in partner countries around the world. This plan has three components:
 The United States is on track to meet that goal with a preliminary estimate of $6.5 billion of bilateral and multilateral assistance in 2006.
 While in Africa, Mrs. Bush will meet with community leaders and visit participants in PEPFAR, PMI, and USAID's Africa Education Initiative programs.
