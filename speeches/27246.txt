Dear Mrs. Thunberg:
I have considered the initial report of the Federal Woman's Award Study Group and have approved the recommendations you have made. The report clearly indicated that something must be done to further the program for women in the Federal service.
I have asked Secretary Wirtz to have the Interdepartmental Committee on the Status of Women give early consideration to the form of issuance of the proposed Executive Order. I have asked Chairman Macy to initiate immediate action on the other recommendations of the Study Group and to report to me by the first of July the progress made.
As a Nation, we cannot continue to afford through outmoded custom or attitude the senseless waste of the capability potential of American women. It is my firm intent, and I have expressed this many times since I became President, to have the Federal service truly exemplify equal opportunity for all in employment and advancement regardless of race, color, creed, national origin or sex. I am confident that the work of the Study Group will continue to contribute to the attainment of this objective.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Mrs. Penelope H. Thunberg, Chairman, Federal Woman's Award Study Group, U.S. Tariff Commission, Washington, D.C.]
