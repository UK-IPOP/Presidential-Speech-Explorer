Your Majesty:
You have visited our country many times, but it is a very great honor for me to welcome you on this occasion officially as the head of state and the head of government of the great nation you represent.
I know that the talks that we shall have and the talks that your advisers will have with members of our Administration will contribute to the already excellent relations we have between our two countries.
And I am particularly looking forward to the opportunity of having the benefit of your wise counsel as one of the senior statesmen of the world on how our two nations can work together for a just and secure peace in the Mideast and in all parts of the world.
I know that this visit will be of great benefit to the representatives of our Government, and we hope that you and all the members of your royal party will enjoy your stay in our Nation's Capital.
