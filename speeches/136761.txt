Today, President Donald J. Trump announced that the following Members of the House of Representatives will serve as part of his team working to combat this hyper-partisan and baseless impeachment. This initial list includes the following Members:

Congressman Doug Collins
Congressman Mike Johnson
Congressman Jim Jordan
Congresswoman Debbie Lesko
Congressman Mark Meadows
Congressman John Ratcliffe
Congresswoman Elise Stefanik
Congressman Lee Zeldin

Throughout this process, these Members of Congress have provided guidance to the White House team, which was prohibited from participating in the proceedings concocted by Democrats in the House of Representatives. The President looks forward to their continued participation and is confident that the Members will help expeditiously end this brazen political vendetta on behalf of the American people.
