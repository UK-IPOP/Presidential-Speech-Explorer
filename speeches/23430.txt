Dear Mr.___________:
I am transmitting herewith a Report by the Secretary of the Treasury reviewing the wide variety of measures undertaken by this Administration to cope with the urgent balance of payments problem that faces this country.
A start has been made over the past year, but much still remains to be done. We must do more, consistent with our responsibilities for leadership of the free world, to stem the outward flow of dollars from Government programs. We must work with our friends and trading partners to achieve a more equitable sharing of the burdens of aid and defense, and to build a stronger international financial system. Above all, we must harness the energies of all our people--in labor and management as well as Government-to the vital task of keeping our industry competitive and expanding our exports.
To that end, I intend to implement promptly a key recommendation of this Report by appointing, within the Department Of Commerce, a new top-level official to oversee and expedite all our varied efforts to penetrate foreign markets more deeply.
This and other actions, to be fully effective, will require the understanding support of the Congress. I particularly urge prompt consideration and approval by the Congress of each of the specific measures summarized at the end of the Secretary's Report.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
