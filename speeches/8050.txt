H.R. 4664, entitled "An act for the relief of Capt. George R. Armstrong, United States Army, retired," is hereby returned without my approval. Attached hereto is a letter from the Secretary of War setting out reasons why this bill ought not to become a law. If it stood by itself it might not be important enough to warrant a veto. It is a bill, however, of a series which have been passed, two of which have already reached me, and taken in its connection with others of a like nature I am unable to give it my approval.
