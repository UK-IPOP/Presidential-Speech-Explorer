"The President has been clear that energy supply should meet demand to support economic growth and lower prices for American consumers and consumers around the world. The President has taken action – including historic release of oil from US and global strategic reserves and working with allies on a price cap on Russian oil to ensure we maintain a global supply of oil, even as we punish Putin for his action. U.S. oil production is up by more than half a million barrels per day since the beginning of the year and is on track to be up by more than one million barrels per day by the end of the year, on the way to a new production record next year. Americans have seen gas prices come down every day this summer — 12 consecutive weeks of price declines at the pump and the fastest decline in over a decade. President Biden is determined to continue to take every step necessary to shore up energy supplies and lower energy prices."

POTUS disembarked amid the occasional spot of rain at 20:26.
He was tieless and walked alone to the residence with a briefcase in hand. He ignored shouted questions other than turning briefly to smile.
Apologies.
Your Pooler couldn't hear anything but apparently POTUS said 'no' to a shouted question about whether Russia should be designated a state sponsor of terrorism. And then smiled.

Goodnight everyone. Enjoy the rest of your Labor Day
