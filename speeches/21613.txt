Today is time of celebration and of sorrow.
We celebrate the emergence into democracy of the oldest and most populous land in all the world - but we mourn its captivity at the hands of Chinese imperialism.
We delight in the long friendship which has endured between the peoples of China and America. They share in common a desire for freedom, a respect for law, and the character of industry without which great nations cannot be built.
We deeply regret the policies and actions of the Government of Communist China which have interrupted the generations of friendship between our countries, and we reaffirm our resolve that the evil tyranny which enslaves 600 million people in China must, like tyrannies everywhere, be replaced by free government.
The good faith of the United States is pledged to the defense of Formosa, and to the restoration of democracy in China
To all of our citizens of Chinese ancestry, I say: "Long life and prosperity on this 49th anniversary of the independence day of the Chinese Republic!"
