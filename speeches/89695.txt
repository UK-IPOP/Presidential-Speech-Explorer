 – As Senator John Edwards visits Boston today to share his bold plans for change with supporters at a "Small Change for Big Change" grassroots fundraiser, prominent Massachusetts Democrats endorsed Edwards for president. More than 30 Democrats, including several state representatives, are supporting Edwards as the best candidate to change our country and build an America where every person has the opportunity to succeed.
Former Massachusetts Attorney General Scott Harshbarger endorsed Edwards saying, "Most people agree with me that this year there are some very good choices to be the Democratic nominee for president. I—and the other elected and politically experienced people joining with me today—have concluded, however, that there is one truly exceptional choice among the candidates. John Edwards brings to this race the compassion, experience, integrity and vision to lift our nation from the failure of the past six years to truly become this century's first great American leader. And I and the others who join me in supporting him are committed to doing all we can to ensure he has that opportunity."
"John Edwards shares the vision of the Massachusetts Legislature that all people deserve quality, affordable health care and he wants to bring that vision to the entire country," said State Representative Steven Walsh. "He is concerned about the shrinking middle class, a result of declining salaries and rising costs for things like housing and education. John Edwards truly is the best choice for hard working families in the Commonwealth who want a more promising future. I am proud to support his candidacy and work with him to improve the lives of all Americans."
