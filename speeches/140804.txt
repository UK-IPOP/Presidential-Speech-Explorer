If you thought Joe Biden's clunky, 
 slogan "Build Back Better" sounds like unoriginal, political consultant-speak, you're right. In fact, 
 and was doing so before 




It's not the first time 
 copying the words of a British politician. Biden got caught in 1987 
 from a campaign speech by British politician Neil Kinnockand 
.Biden also had to apologizefor plagiarizing five pages from a law review journal while he was a law student.

Back then, Biden's plagiarism scandal sunk his failed presidential campaign.He still hasn't learned from his mistakes.
