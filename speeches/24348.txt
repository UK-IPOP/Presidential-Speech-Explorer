JOE WALKER and Major Cross gave their lives in advancing science and technology. Their deaths remind us how dependent we are on men of exceptional ability in the development of new vehicles in flight.
They died while training for demanding assignments in a new field of major national interest--research on supersonic transport flight. They added immeasurably to the progress this Nation is making in that effort.
I extend my deepest sympathies to their families.
