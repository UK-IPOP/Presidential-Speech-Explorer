Dear Mr. Chairman:
I have your recent letter discussing the use of the claim of "executive privilege" in connection with Congressional requests for documents and other information.
Since assuming the Presidency, I have followed the policy laid down by President Kennedy in his letter to you of March 7, 1962, dealing with this subject. Thus, the claim of "executive privilege" will continue to be made only by the President.
This administration has attempted to cooperate completely with the Congress in making available to it all information possible, and that will continue to be our policy.
I appreciate the time and energy that you and your Subcommittee have devoted to this subject and welcome the opportunity to state formally my policy on this important subject.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[The Honorable John E. Moss, Chairman, Foreign Operations and Government Information Subcommittee of the Committee on Government Operations, House Office Building, Washington, D.C.]
