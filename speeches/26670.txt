APPALACHIA teaches many lessons. Its recent progress tells us that the partnership of Federal, State, and local governments can work--in Appalachia and in other regions.
The national interest demands we do more to strengthen the economies and improve the lives of the millions of Americans in these vast areas. Boundaries of States do not define areas of need. Only by working together can adjoining States, with the assistance of the Federal Government, find common solutions to their common problems.
Much work awaits us in rebuilding the cities of America to meet the needs of growing populations. But we cannot afford to neglect the areas that lie beyond the cities or the people that live in them. They too must be permitted to share in America's great abundance.
The steps I take today will make the Federal Government a stronger, more efficient partner in meeting this complex challenge of our times.
