Today, I introduced legislation with my colleague Senator Tom Harkin to require the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to immediately release the names of all 128 nursing homes on its Special Focus Facility list. It is absolutely inexcusable that CMS has withheld this information from seniors and their families who are making critical life decisions about long term care. Even more disturbing are press reports that CMS has shared this information with nursing home industry lobbyists, but not with the public.
Over a week ago, I called on CMS to fully disclose the names of these 128 nursing homes, as well as all information on the nursing home designations that CMS has made. But CMS has failed to act.
