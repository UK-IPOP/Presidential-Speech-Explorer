Dear Mr. Secretary .
Pursuant to the authority vested in the President by section 5(f) of the International Health Research Act of 1960 (PL 86-610), you are authorized to undertake a joint United States-Japan medical research program. This program, designed to pool the knowledge and resources of the two countries in fighting major diseases affecting the people of Asia, results from the discussions which I had with Prime Minister Sato in January. It is known as the United States Japan Cooperative Medical Science Program.
The program responsibility assigned to you hereby will be administered within the limits of foreign policy as prescribed by the Secretary of State.
I am pleased with this opportunity for the United States to participate with Japan in the joint solution of health problems which will have worldwide benefits.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Honorable John W. Gardner, Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, Washington, D.C. 20201 ]
