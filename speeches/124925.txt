Despite being told by his party's establishment wing he was too young or not ready to run for president, Republican hopeful Sen. Marco Rubio said Saturday he couldn't afford to be patient.
Talking to a crowd of around 1,500 people at the Hilton Head Island High School gymnasium, Rubio, 44, said he bucked the GOP establishment in 2010 when he decided to run for the U.S. Senate and again last year when he opted to dive into the presidential race.
"They told me 'You have to wait,' and my answer is 'Wait for what?'" the Florida senator said. "After seven years of (President) Barack Obama, this is no time for patience. If we get this election wrong, there will be no turning back for America.
