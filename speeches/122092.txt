Average Family Healthcare Costs for Family Making $50,000:
According to Kaiser Family Foundation, the average employer contribution for family coverage is $12,591. Under Sen. Sanders' proposal that amount goes down to 6.7 percent of payroll ($3,350).
The cost to the employer for a worker with a family who makes $50,000 would go from $12,591 to $3,350.
Insurance costs are based on averages from Kaiser Family Foundation 
 from 2015.Â In addition, the actual tax paid by the family would likely be even less because it is based on taxable income, not income.
