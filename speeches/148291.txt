Pool Reports by 
, 
Hello from Wilmington. We have a lunch lid until 12:30 p.m. As a reminder, POTUS has nothing on his public schedule today.
Pool joined the motorcade near POTUS' residence at about 2:04 pm.
We are on the move but have not been given a destination.
It had been raining but now there's some sun.
The motorcade arrived at Fieldstone Golf Club at about 2:14 pm.
The pool van did not enter the club with POTUS.
We were given no information on his activity or any companions.
When we first pulled out of his neighborhood, some people from the crowd attending a sporting event at the nearby school held up their phones as we passed.
From the White House: The President's golf partners are his brother-in-law, Jack Owens, his grandson Hunter Biden, and a friend of his grandson.
Your pooler will note that while he was there, the rain returned for a bit and there was also some brief hail - at least where the pool was holding, more than 2 miles away.
The pool rejoined the motorcade at the entrance of Fieldstone at 4:33 pm.
The motorcade returned to the residence at about 4:42 pm.
Before entering POTUS' neighborhood, we passed by the Ursuline Academy where a few people standing at the intersection waved at the motorcade or recorded the moment by phone.
