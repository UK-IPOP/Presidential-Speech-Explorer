 "Rudy Giuliani has decisively staked out his position. He supports a national catastrophe fund. He gets it. He understands that sometimes seemingly local issues that affect our pocketbooks are really national issues which demand national attention. He also understands that in some cases, the federal government has a legitimate role to play. In the case of insurance, he understands that states can no longer go it alone."

 Mayor Giuliani: "Every community in America must be prepared for natural disasters and terrorist attacks, which is why I support the creation of a National Catastrophe Insurance Fund and why I have made ensuring that every community in America is prepared for terrorist attacks and natural disasters one of my 12 Commitments to the American People. … Right now, many people in states like Florida, California and Louisiana find it difficult to purchase insurance for catastrophic natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina. It's right for the government to play a role in seeing that fair, equitable and affordable private insurance markets are open for all our citizens." (Rudy Giuliani For President, Press Release, 1/10/08)
 "A national insurance pool has lingered on Florida's wish list due to opposition from disaster-free states. Asked about the proposal, McCain called for improving the Federal Emergency Management Agency, widely panned for its shoddy response after Hurricane Katrina. 'I do not support a national catastrophic insurance policy,' McCain said. 'That insurance policy is there and it's called FEMA and it's called national disaster preparedness. . . . I still do not have confidence that FEMA is capable of handling all of those responsibilities.' Responding to the criticism from the Giuliani camp, a McCain spokeswoman said proposed legislation failed to 'include private insurance reforms to broaden markets and protect against cherry-picking of individual states.' Romney has not endorsed an insurance pool but said he would consider it." (Beth Reinhard, "GOP Courting Florida's Cubans," The Miami Herald, 1/22/08)
 "Asked about a national catastrophe fund to ease the property insurance crisis in Florida and other states, [Huckabee] was receptive but said he'd have to see the details. Rebuilding people's beach homes doesn't appeal to him, but, 'I come from a state that's prone to tornadoes and floods. I understand how devastating it can be, so I'm very sympathetic.'" ("State Is Gaining Clout, GOP Told," St. Petersburg Times, 5/20/07)
 ROMNEY: "[W]e're going to have to work together to create a program that gets people in high-risk areas insured. Now, I'm not in favor of saying that the people in Iowa should have to subsidize the people in Massachusetts or the people in Florida. That doesn't make a lot of sense. But to have those states that are in high-risk areas come together and say, How do we organize an effort on a national basis that actuarially deals with the differences between different states and the different risks they face and make sure that we have a backstop behind the private insurance industry? That makes a lot of sense. … I do support an effort to get everybody some form of catastrophic coverage. And it may be a public-private partnership between private insurance industries and the federal government. It may be done with the states. But I'll bring together the governors of all 50 states, as well as leadership in Washington, as well as industry representatives, to say, What's the right way to fashion this that makes the most sense for the people of America?"

 "And I'll deliver a national catastrophe fund to reduce insurance rates because I know what it means to your future."
 "Giuliani supports one of the top priorities of Crist and other Florida leaders from both parties: creation of a national fund to help cover catastrophic loses from national disasters. The idea is to spread the risk and limit the liability of insurance companies so they can provide more affordable rates. 'You should have a federal backstop for once-in-a-century catastrophes, once-in-a-decade catastrophes, these horrible things that happen,' he said. He said beneficiaries and state and local governments need to absorb some risk. Noting New York's potential vulnerability to hurricanes and the West Coast's susceptibility to earthquakes, Giuliani said such a program would be good for other parts of the country as well as Florida."

I think it's a very good idea not just for Florida, it's a very good idea for the whole country. We all need it. You need it for hurricanes, California needs it for earthquakes, somebody else needs it for tornadoes. New York needs it for ice storms and for hurricanes. During the time I was the mayor, my governor, Governor Pataki, had to deal with two really catastrophic ice storms in northern New York. We sent him some help, he did a great job of doing it, but we need that help.
