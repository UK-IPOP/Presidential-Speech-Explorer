The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today unveils the latest group of County Chairs and Co-Chairs in South Carolina. They join previously announced county leaders in the state helping build strong grassroots support for the Mayor.
"South Carolinians from across the state and from all walks of life are declaring their support for Rudy's leadership and fiscal conservatism," said Barry Wynn, Giuliani's South Carolina State Chairman. "I'm pleased this latest group of folks has offered to join us in the effort to elect Rudy. He is the best candidate to lead our country because he's the only Republican who can run a 50-state campaign in the general election."
