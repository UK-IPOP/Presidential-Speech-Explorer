 â€“ U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, today addressed the John Locke Foundation Luncheon where he highlighted the disintegration of America's leadership on the world stage under the foreign policy of President Obama and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"President Obama and Secretary Clinton have had their chance," Sen. Cruz said. "Their policies do not work. Leading from behind is a dismal failure. We need a new track. We need to get back to the principles that made America strong. We need to restore America's leadership."
In his remarks, Cruz noted numerous instances of the failed Obama-Clinton foreign policies and offered priorities that the United States must pursue in order to restore America's leadership in the world.
"We need new leadership in Washington that doesn't just start with symbolic steps, but it starts by making clear that America will stand with our friends and stand up to our enemies. It starts by making clear that America will stand unshakably with the nation of Israel, and that we will use every lever at our disposal to prevent the United Nations from undermining the sovereignty of our nation. And it means standing up to bad guys, such as making clear to brutal dictators like the Castros in Cuba, that billions in economic relief will not flow until real reforms and freedom occur."
Cruz concluded his remarks with words of encouragement, "We've seen great challenges before. And every time we've seen great challenges, with God's providential blessing, the American people have risen to the occasion."
