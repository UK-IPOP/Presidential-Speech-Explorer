 The Historical Landmark Commission of Wyoming has donated to the United States in trust certain lands with the structures thereon comprising the abandoned Fort Laramie, for the purpose of improving, preserving, and conducting such lands and structures as a public historical site; and
 the lands and structures are of great historic interest and constitute a historic landmark; and
 it appears that it would be in the public interest to reserve such lands and structures as a national monument, to be known as the Fort Laramie National Monument:
 President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 2 of the act of June 8, 1906, ch. 3060, 34 Stat. 225 (U.S.C., title 16, sec. 431), do proclaim that the following-described lands in Wyoming are hereby reserved and set apart as the Fort Laramie National Monument:

, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 16th day of July in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-third.
