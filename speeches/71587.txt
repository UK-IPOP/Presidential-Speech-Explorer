The Administration strongly supports H.R. 3811. The bill would implement a Presidential initiative, making it a felony for an individual to travel to another State or country with the intent of avoiding the payment of child support.
H.R. 3811 would affect direct spending and receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. The Office of Management and Budget estimates that the bill's net deficit effect would be negligible.
