To the Senate of the United States:
On January 17, 1949 I transmitted to the Senate a convention (No. 63) concerning the statistics of wages and hours of work in the principal mining and manufacturing industries, including building and construction, and in agriculture, adopted by the International Labor Conference at its twenty-fourth session, Geneva, June 2-22, 1938. In my message transmitting the convention I requested that the Senate give its advice and consent to ratification thereof, subject to an understanding that the convention shall apply only to the continental United States.
As a result of a reappraisal of the situation in regard to the territorial application of the convention, I now request that the Senate give its advice and consent to ratification subject only to the understanding that the convention shall not apply to the Canal Zone until such time as extended thereto by proclamation of the President of the United States of America.
For the information of the Senate I transmit herewith the report of the Secretary of State with respect to this matter, together with a copy of a letter from the Secretary of Labor to the Secretary of State.
