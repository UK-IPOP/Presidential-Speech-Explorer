Here what David Axelrod said on Sunday, during an interview on ABC's "This Week with George Stephanopoulos."
I showed the above to the reporters who cover the Rezko-Obama story.
For the record, here's what they said.
Sun-Times Reporter Tim Novak

"David Axelrod has never talked to me, Fusco or Mckinney about Obama. Neither has Obama. All we've gotten are responses to written questions, and who knows who actually answered those. And occassionally we talk to (Bill) Burton. But the point is that Obama himself has never sat down and discussed these questions about Rezko."
Sun-Times Reporter Chris Fusco

"Tim is absolutely right about that one."
Sun-Times Springfield Bureau Chief Dave McKinney

"Well, I know Chris and I have never had a sit-down interview with Obama. Axelrod might be referring to the December 2006 Q and A, but as you know those were written questions and written responses. I believe Tim's experience was identical when he wrote about Rezko's slum properties. Axelrod would have been more accurate, perhaps, had he said today that Obama has "communicated" with reporters (through spokesmen and a Q and A). But he hasn't spoken to us directly about this. You are right. Axelrod is wrong."
