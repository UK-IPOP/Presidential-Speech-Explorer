"Under his leadership, Texas gained more than one million net new jobs. Gov. Perry's record proves that he is the right choice for our nation."
"Rick Perry doesn't just talk about conservative reform, he backs it up with actions," said State Representative Allen Peake, Majority Caucus Secretary/Treasurer. "Gov. Perry is a principled conservative who has cut taxes, reduced spending and stood up to the job-killing regulations from Washington bureaucrats."
"I am humbled to have the support of so many Republican lawmakers in Georgia," said Gov. Rick Perry.
