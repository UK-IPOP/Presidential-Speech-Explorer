The Administration supports House passage of S. 296 as reported by the House Judiciary Committee. The Administration will consult with Congress on technical drafting concerns with the bill.



The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) requires that all revenue and direct spending legislation meet a pay-as-you-go requirement. That is, no such bill should result in an increase in the deficit; and if it does, it must trigger a sequester if not fully offset. OMB's preliminary scoring estimates for this bill are presented below. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from these estimates. If S. 296 were enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published within five days of enactment, as required by OBRA. The cumulative effects of all enacted legislation on direct spending will be issued in monthly reports transmitted to the Congress.
