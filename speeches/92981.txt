"'Romney's being a hypocrite on this issue … I did not receive any mandate, any communication, anything at all from him about this. If it's so important to him why didn't he have the state police enforcing it?'" – Joseph Curtatone, Mayor of Somerville, MA (2004-Present)

 "While it is technically true that Romney 'signed an agreement with the federal government to allow state troopers to enforce federal immigration laws,' he only did so in the closing weeks of his term, and the program never actually went into effect because it was rescinded by Romney's successor even before the state troopers began training."

 "A Globe analysis of nine recent public works projects … revealed that of 242 workers on weekly payroll lists, more than a third appeared to lack legitimate Social Security numbers. On one of the payrolls reviewed, for masonry work on the UMass dormitory project, nearly two-thirds of the contractor's 87 workers had bogus or questionable Social Security numbers. The numbers used by the workers in many cases appeared obviously fraudulent. One laborer who helped build the new jail in Billerica submitted a number that should have immediately raised eyebrows: 666-66-6666. Some numbers belonged to people who were long-deceased, the Globe found. Others were matched to people who live out of state and had no idea their numbers had been appropriated. The findings, though a small snapshot of the vast number of public projects undertaken throughout the state, suggest how the use of undocumented workers has extended into almost every corner of the economy. … A spokesman for Governor Mitt Romney said it was unsurprising state money was used to pay undocumented immigrants. 'The governor is not surprised that our current immigration laws are a mess,' said Romney spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom."

 "The [illegal immigrant lawn] worker in Copado said a state trooper stationed in Romney's driveway once inquired about his immigration status, about six months ago. Saenz, the company owner, who was at the property at the time, told the trooper that the worker was in the country legally, but had forgotten his papers, the worker told the Globe. The trooper never inquired again, said the worker, who repeatedly returned to the governor's property but avoided the trooper. Saenz told reporters he did not recall the incident."

 "[T]he City of Cambridge rejects the use of the word 'illegal' to describe human beings and the use of the word 'aliens' to describe immigrants and hereby adopts the language 'undocumented' when referring to those who do not have federally recognized resident status and 'immigrant' to refer to those who have migrated to the US from another country …" (Cambridge, MA, City Council, Policy Order Resolution,

 "Earlier today, I spoke with John Clifford, a press spokesman for Cambridge Mayor Kenneth Reeves, and asked whether the city remembers any pressure, financial or otherwise, applied by the Romney administration asking them to change their sanctuary status when it was up for renewal last year. 'Absolutely not,' Clifford responded. I followed up by asking whether the Democratic government of Cambridge had clashed with the Republican administration of Romney at any time during his term as governor. Clifford laughed. 'He never took on Cambridge, except out of state.'" (Philip Klein, "Sanctuary Cities in Romney's Massachusetts," The American Spectator, 8/9/07)
