 Mr. President——
 How are you? Happy New Year.
Have you talked to your family about running for reelection, sir?
 There's an election coming up?
Yes.
 I didn't know that.
What's your priorities for 2023?
How was dinner?
 It was good. Dinner was good. And 2023 is going to be a good year.
How is your vacation so far?
 So far, I've got my grandkids, and everything is well. I've got my daughter. Everyone is down there, the whole dang family. So we're in good shape.
Thank you.
