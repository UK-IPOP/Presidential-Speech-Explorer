Pool met up with motorcade near the Biden residence at 8:20.
We rolled to Brandywine Creek State Park, where POTUS boarded Marine One at 8:29 holding a small light brown briefcase.
Also boarding Marine One was Hunter holding his son, Beau.
POTUS was airborne at 8:34.
Pool is taking a bus back to D.C. Handing off to in-town pool. Happy Monday everyone.
Per White House, also traveling on Marine One:
Annie Tomasini, Assistant to the President & Director of Oval Office Operations
Joshua Geltzer, Deputy Assistant to the President & Deputy Homeland Security Advisor

A few Manchin-related questions were shouted over the helicopter’s whine. The President, walking deliberately towards the Oval, did not engage.
And for any confused readers in the hinterlands, I headed my first dispatch "WH Pool 2," picking up on the out-of-town pool reports #1 and #1a.
And the Psaki briefing has been moved to 2:00 PM.
