AUSTIN — The Perry campaign today released a 60-second television advertisement entitled "President of Honor," which will air on Iowa broadcast and cable.
Jim Livingston: "My name is Jim Livingston. I am a retired major general."
Daniel P. Moran: "Governor Perry — he is the best person to serve as commander in chief."
Dakota Meyer: "Any veteran that I knew needed help, Governor Perry always told me whatever he could do to care of them he would do it."
Marcus Luttrell: "Governor Rick Perry — he is one of the most honorable men I've ever met."
Michael E. Thornton: "This is about how we can lead this nation. Rick Perry is that leader."
Announcer: "Ladies and gentlemen, the next President of the United States."
Gov. Perry: "Washington's broken. Replacing one Washington insider with another won't change a thing."
Gov. Perry: "I'm the outsider who's willing to step on some toes. We can surely recapture what is great about America. And we can restore this nation to its preeminence in the world as a beacon of individual liberty and economic prosperity. And there is no greater cause in our time."
Daniel P. Moran: "You can't tell me America is not exceptional. You can't tell me that because I've seen it."
Gov. Perry: "I'm Rick Perry and I approve of this message."
