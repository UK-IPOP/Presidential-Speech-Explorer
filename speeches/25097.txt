THE NATION has begun to make great progress in meeting its educational needs, but much more remains to be done.
Education is the key to opportunity in our society, and equality of educational opportunity must be the birthright of every citizen.
No other challenge concerns me more than this one. None is of greater importance to the American people. For this reason, I am asking leaders of American education, business, labor, and other .public groups to meet with me in Washington on July 20 and 21 at a White House Conference on Education.
I have asked John W. Gardner, president of the Carnegie Corporation of New York, to serve as conference chairman. A list of Governors and educators who will serve on the conference committee will be made available to you at the close of this press conference.
All of us can benefit from a lively exchange of views on the major problems confronting our schools and colleges. We need to pool our best ideas about how to stimulate and to enrich the Nation's adventure in learning.
