 — More than 700 mostly-young supporters greeted 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul at a rally held at the University of Northern Iowa (UNI), just one night after a similar event at Iowa State University (ISU) netted more than 1,350 supporters.
Event organizers noted that the start of the event was delayed because the local fire marshal was contacted due to the quickly-gathering large crowd.
The event was held at UNI in the Commons — Slife Ballroom, located at 1224 West 23
 Street in Cedar Falls. Like the ISU event, tonight's rally far exceeded the expectations of the "Youth for Ron Paul" organizers charged with planning and executing the events.
Youth for Ron Paul, an initiative of the Ron Paul 2012 Presidential Campaign, launched on Wednesday, September 7
 and since its inception more than 18,000 people signed up to get involved, forming 355 chapters in 46 states.
