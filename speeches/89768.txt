 Today, Governor Mitt Romney named the Romney for President New Hampshire Business Coalition. Led by Statewide Chairs Ben Gamache, Steve Griffin and Ray Pinard and the County Chairs for each of the ten counties across the state, this group of business leaders will work to ensure New Hampshire voters know that Governor Romney is the candidate who will bring real change to Washington by using techniques he learned in the business world.
"Business leaders in New Hampshire and across the nation understand the need for meeting the new generation of challenges confronting our nation today. We must keep taxes low and make sure health care is affordable and available, as these issues impact the bottom line. We need conservative change in Washington to address these challenges, and I'm looking forward to working with these business leaders to make that happen," said Governor Romney.
Chair Ray Pinard said, "If a private business ran like our federal government, it would have closed down a long time ago. We need a proven executive who will change the standard operating procedure in our nation's capital. The business leaders who have joined us today are confident that executive is Governor Romney."
