Mr. Prime Minister and distinguished guests:
As the head of the oldest independent state in the hemisphere, Mr. Prime Minister, I take very special pleasure today in welcoming you to the White House as the leader of the newest.
Around this table you will find seated friends of Guyana who have watched with great excitement and admiration your wise direction in the quest of independence. They join me today in wishing you well as you now begin the arduous task of building your nation.
I am reminded that you share my favorite pastime of horseback riding. I asked Secretary Gordon, when he presented you with that Western saddle last May, to say then that I hoped you would ride tall in it.
I would convey that message personally today. It is very clear that politically speaking you are riding tall in the saddle.
You have greatly honored us by sending, as your first Ambassador to Washington, Sir John Carter. It is a double gain for us. We shall profit from his talents and we welcome home his most charming wife, a talented lady from North Carolina.
Mr. Prime Minister, we share your confidence and your hope in the future. Our desire is to make this hemisphere a shining example of what free men, working together, can accomplish together.
We want Guyana to work with us and to work with the other American States toward this objective.
You may be sure that you can count on our cooperation, our very deep interest, and always our full support.
So, my friends, I should now like to propose that we toast the health of the Queen of Great Britain; the Guyanese Government under the very able leadership of Prime Minister Burnham.
