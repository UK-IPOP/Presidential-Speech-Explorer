 Mr. President, can I ask you—anything you wanted to see in particular?
 I saw the Impressionists' paintings; I wanted to see them. And I wanted to see the living quarters of Catherine the Great. [

 How did it compare to yours?
 I like mine just fine. [

 [
]—house, Mr. President?
 Well, she didn't have to run for election. [

 Are you going to see the Rembrandts here?
 Perhaps, yes. I love the desks. The thing that strikes me is the woodwork. I hadn't counted on seeing all that. You ought to go back and see all the secret chambers in the desk back there. He put everything he had in there.
 Mr. President, you've seen some religious symbols today that have been opened in the last few years to the Russian people. What are your thoughts on seeing things that didn't used to be open during the Soviet era?
 That's a very good thing, not only making it available to the people but also making religious expression legitimate again and making it—encouraging and nourishing it. I think it's a real sign of the health of the Russian democracy that religion is respected and people are free to pursue it and express their honest convictions.
