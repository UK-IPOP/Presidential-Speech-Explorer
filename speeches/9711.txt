My dear Mr. Brush:
I congratulate you and your associates most cordially upon the double launching during this month of the two new freighters of your lines at Chester, Pennsylvania. In their speed and the novelty of their design they indicate again how resourcefulness and ingenuity of American designers and operators may facilitate the development of our invaluable ocean borne commerce.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Graham M. Brush, President, Seatrain Lines, Inc., 39 Broadway, New York City]
