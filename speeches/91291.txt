"If you liked Michael Moore's 'Sicko,' you're going to love HillaryCare 2.0. Senator Clinton's latest health scheme includes more government mandates, expensive federal subsidies and more big bureaucracy – in short, a prescription for an increase in wait times, a decrease in patient care and tax hikes to pay for it all."

 "The [Democratic] candidates compete with one another over whose plan is more 'universal,' but nobody ever explains how you 'require' someone to purchase health insurance. This Is one of the many virtues of a straight-up socialized-medicine scheme. If we had national health care, you wouldn't have to enroll in a plan. You'd automatically be enrolled …" (Timothy Noah, "Edwardscare: A Trojan Horse," Slate, 7/6/07)

 "In Canada, even the anti-privatization Canadian Health Coalition laments long lines. In France and Britain, the tax burden is 42% and 27% respectively, as opposed to 12% in the USA, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

 "The Health Service may not be able to afford the next generation of cancer drugs, senior doctors have warned. Specialists fear that the NHS will be 'crippled' by the increasing range of breakthrough treatments. Some believe that private health insurance is the only way to fund the most expensive drugs. Their concerns raise the prospect of cancer patients spending thousands to have a chance of survival. Furthermore, if patients pay for their own drugs, many NHS trusts refuse to cover the cost of care." (Daniel Martin, "Cancer Drug Costs 'Will Cripple NHS'," [London] Daily Mail, 5/14/07)
 "One person in eight who is admitted to hospital for non-emergency procedure in Britain has to wait more than a year before being treated. Britain's health minister, Andy Burnham, said the NHS should be 'very proud' that only 48 percent had to wait longer than 18 weeks between being referred by a doctor to the start of their treatment because this was an increase from 35 percent."

 "[Clinton] said that the failure of her proposal for universal coverage in 1994 made her more determined to achieve the goal now. 'It also makes me understand what we are up against,' Mrs. Clinton said. 'We have to modernize and reform the way we deliver health care. But we have to change the way we finance it. That's going to mean taking money away from people who make out really well right now.'" (Robert Pear, "Candidates Outline Ideas For Universal Health Care," The New York Times, 3/25/07)
 "It's not clear if Clinton will finance her proposal by repealing the Bush administration's tax cuts for the wealthy, as Edwards and Obama have proposed. On the campaign trail, Clinton has hinted that she would save money by fostering efficiencies and squeezing savings from insurers and drug companies."
