 As the 2007 Nation's Report Card shows, No Child Left Behind (NCLB) is helping raise achievement for all kinds of children, in all kinds of schools, in every part of the country. Students are achieving record success, with minority students, poor students, and students with disabilities reaching all-time highs in a number of areas. As a result, the achievement gap is beginning to close.
 Members of Congress have had nearly a year to consider the Administration's proposals. Secretary Spellings will also continue discussing these important issues with our partners at the State and local levels.
 In 2001, President Bush worked with Republicans and Democrats to pass NCLB. The reauthorization of this bipartisan law is one of the President's top priorities and an area in which he believes both parties can work together to build on NCLB's success, expand opportunity for Americans of all backgrounds, and provide all our children with the quality education they deserve.
