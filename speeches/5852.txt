On March 4, 1910, your honorable body adopted the following resolution:
 That the President of the United States be requested, if not incompatible with the public interest, to furnish the House of Representatives the following information:
First. Why is not the appropriation for the construction of a gunboat on the Great Lakes, contained in the naval appropriation act of eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, expended?
Second. What steps, if any, have been taken by the United States Government to remove the obstacles that prevented the construction of this vessel?
In answer, I beg to transmit herewith a communication from the Secretary of the Navy.
