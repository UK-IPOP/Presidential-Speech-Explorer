Mr. Chancellor, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I am deeply grateful to you, Mr. Chancellor, for your words of welcome and indeed for the warm welcome that your fellow citizens here at this airport have accorded to me and my party.
In my country, the name Adenauer has come to symbolize the determination of the German people to remain strong and free. In the implementation of that determination, the American people stand by your side, and they send through me to you the German people, their very best wishes for your successful efforts in this matter.
And the American people stand by your side in insuring that the loyal, free people of free Berlin will, like yourselves, continue always to enjoy that great privilege.
Like you, Mr. Chancellor, I look forward to the talks we shall have. It is indeed for me a great honor to come back to this land to meet your elected leader, and with him discuss some of those matters that are so important to both our countries.
To all of you, God bless you.
