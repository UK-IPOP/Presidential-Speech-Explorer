Disastrous floods in the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys already have driven 270,000 men, women and children from their homes. There is every likelihood that until the crest of the flood waters is reached, this number of homeless refugees will be largely increased. Snow, sleet and freezing weather have added to the suffering and made more hazardous the work of rescue.
The victims of this grave disaster are dependent upon the American Red Cross for food, shelter, fuel, medical care and warm clothing. I have instructed the various agencies of the Federal Government to cooperate to the fullest extent with the Red Cross authorities.
In order that the Red Cross may meet these immediate emergency needs and continue to care for these unfortunates until the waters have receded and they can be returned to their homes, it is imperative that a minimum relief fund of two million dollars be raised as speedily as possible. We are looking to this great national relief agency to act as our representative in this emergency.
As President of the United States and as President of the American Red Cross, I am, therefore, urging all of our people to contribute promptly and most generously to this relief fund so that adequate relief may be made instantly available for these thousands of our homeless and suffering fellow citizens.
I am confident the response everywhere will be immediate and generous.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.Â 
 at the City of Washington this 23d day of January in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-seven and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-first.
