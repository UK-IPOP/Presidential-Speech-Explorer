At a time when communities across the country have gathered to call for equal justice for all Americans, Donald Trump persists in his political strategy of division. He has fanned the flames of hatred and refused to condemn all violence. Just last month, Trump's longtime advisor and 2016 campaign manager Kellyanne Conway even said of protests following the tragic murder of George Floyd that the more violence, the "better it is" for Trump's reelection. This is Donald Trump's America.

Joe Biden has been very clear: violence is unacceptable, no matter who commits it. He has shown by example that a real leader can stand up for equal justice -- listening to the families and communities in pain, and taking action to unite the country -- while unequivocally condemning violence of all kinds.

Why can't Trump do the same?

Portland and Kenosha are hardly the first instances of Trump's refusal to categorically and unequivocally condemn violence. After 32-year-old Heather Heyer was killed protesting a rally of neo Nazis and white supremacists in Charlottesville, Trump said there were "very fine people on both sides."

Let's not forget that Donald Trump is also the candidate who tear-gassed peaceful protestors for a photo-op and vilely bragged that he could shoot someone in public with impunity.
