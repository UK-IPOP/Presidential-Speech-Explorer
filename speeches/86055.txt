 The President's pro-growth policies have encouraged robust economic growth and job creation, thereby strengthening government revenues and helping to reduce the deficit. The new report estimates this year's deficit to be $296 billion or 2.3 percent of GDP. Projections now show the deficit will fall to $188 billion in 2008, or 1.3 percent of GDP, surpassing President Bush's original goal of cutting the deficit in half by FY2009 from its FY2004 projected peak of $521 billion, or 4.5 percent of GDP.
