By separate letter, I have transmitted to the Speaker of the House, President of the Senate, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the Chairman of the House International Relations Committee the certification and unclassified report detailing the history and current developments in the nonproliferation policies and practices of the People's Republic of China that are required by Public Law 99- 183, relating to the approval and implementation of the agreement for nuclear cooperation between the United States and the People's Republic of China.
Because of the information controls on the classified report that the Administration has also prepared for Congress on China's nonproliferation policies and practices in fulfillment of the remaining requirement of Public Law 99-183, I am transmitting the required classified report directly to your Committee. The Administration regards the report transmitted herewith as containing sensitive intelligence and diplomatic information and requests that it be treated accordingly.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
