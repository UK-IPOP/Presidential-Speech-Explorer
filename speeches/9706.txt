THE RESULT of the election in Maine imposes need for renewed and stronger effort that the people may fully understand the issues at stake. We have known all along that, owing to the ravages of the world depression, our fight is a hard one; but we have a strong case and a right cause. Our task is to acquaint every man and woman in the country with the facts and issues which confront the nation.
In periods of emergency and stress, steadfast adherence to sound principles of government is indispensable to national security and a prerequisite to recovery in business, agriculture and employment. Adherence to these principles has saved the country during the last twelve months from all manner of destructive panaceas. This adherence and the measures' and policies we have adopted have preserved these principles and laid the foundation for recovery.
My chief concern now is that the work of reconstruction shall go forward steadily and that the forces we have mobilized to that end, and which are beginning to prove effective, shall continue. This transcends all personal and partisan considerations.
