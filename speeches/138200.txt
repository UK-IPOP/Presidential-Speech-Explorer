Democrats' attempt to paint Joe Biden as some sort of racial healer who can unify our country is a total joke. 
. He also worked with racist segregationists to enact laws that disproportionately harmed minority communities. At the end of Biden's time in office, 69% of Americans – 
 – said that race relations were mostly bad.

Even Biden's own running mate, Phony Kamala Harris, 
 him for working with and praising racist segregationists. She called his actions "hurtful." Now she's singing a different tune.
