My dear Mr. Stelzle:
I regret that duties here make it impossible for me to be present at the testimonial dinner to Dr. Fred B. Smith, and I wish that you would please express for me my great admiration for Dr. Smith's character and appreciation of his outstanding services to the religious life of the world during his forty years of intense activity.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
