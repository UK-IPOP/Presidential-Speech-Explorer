Assuming that the early returns are wholly dependable, I do not hesitate to say that I am pleased, of course. I am happy to utter my gratitude. But I am not exultant. It is not a personal victory. It is a renewed expression of confident Americanism and a national call to the Republican Party.
It is all so serious, the obligations are so solemn that instead of exulting I am more given to prayer to God to make me capable of playing my part, and that all these calls to responsibility may meet the aspirations and expectations of America and the world.
I am sure the people who have voted the Republican ticket will understand my feeling that I should make no unstudied statement of policies at this time, beyond the expression made throughout the campaign.
