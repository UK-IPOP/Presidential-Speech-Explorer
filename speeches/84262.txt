The Senate today missed another opportunity to pass FSC/ETI legislation to reform the tax code and remove the underlying reason for the sanctions that have been imposed by the European Union on U.S. manufacturers, farmers, and other job creators. The Senate's failure to act means that American workers and businesses will continue to be penalized by these sanctions. The sooner Congress acts to address this issue, the sooner these burdensome sanctions will be lifted. We urge immediate action.
