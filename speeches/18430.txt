YOUR GOVERNMENT has been asked frequently in recent months why a Ground Observer Corps of civilian volunteers is needed to help defend our country. After a thorough evaluation of our Air Defense System 1 issued a statement, on July 12, 1952, endorsing the necessity that this Corps operate 24 hours a day.
 The foremost reasonwhy "Operation Skywatch" is carried on day and night is to have in being an organization capable of detecting low-flying aircraft that have avoided detection by our radar warning system and thus to prevent a surprise attack upon our country.
 See Item 202.
On this December 7, 1952, the 11th anniversary of the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, I wish to call to your attention the fact that an attack of this nature can happen again. Because of the immense destructive power of the atomic bomb we must maintain vigilance so that our cities and our industries will be less vulnerable to devastating attack.
I therefore call upon all citizens who reside in communities which have been designated as possible enemy air approach areas to volunteer their services for this vital task.
