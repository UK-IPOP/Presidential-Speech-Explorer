This week, the Biden Administration launched the new COVIDTests.gov website to make it easy for Americans to order free, at-home rapid tests directly to their homes. The website's launch was met with overwhelmingly positive reviews, noting that it is simple, quick, and easy to use.
Testing is a critical tool to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Last week, President Biden announced the administration is purchasing one billion at-home rapid tests to give to Americans for free, building on significant steps to expand capacity and increase access to tests. The first 500 million of these tests are now available for order on COVIDTests.gov.
