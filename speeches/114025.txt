Americans have a clear choice in addressing our nation's mounting debt and deficits. President Obama's failed policies have added over $5 trillion in new debt and run up four straight trillion-dollar deficits — and he's promising trillions in new debt if he's re-elected. Mitt Romney will implement immediate spending cuts and put our debt on a sustainable course to stop passing our bills on to the next generation." — Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson

 "This past year's deficit of $1.3 trillion -- the fourth straight year that figure has topped $1 trillion -- is sure to be an issue in the Wednesday debate between President Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney." (David Jackson, "Obama Faces Trillion Dollar Deficits,"

 "The latest posting by the Treasury Department shows the national debt has now increased $4 trillion on President Obama's watch. The debt was $10.626 trillion on the day Mr. Obama took office. The latest calculation from Treasury shows the debt has now hit $14.639 trillion. It's the most rapid increase in the debt under any U.S. president."

 "That brought the ratio of debt to GDP to more than 100%. The Congressional Budget Office estimated last month the budget deficit for the 2012 fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, will be about $1.1 trillion." (Jim Puzzanghera, "Moody's Warns Of U.S. Credit Rating Cut If Debt Problems Continue,"

 "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said Friday that President Obama's 2013 budget will hurt the economy in the long term, arguing the larger deficits it would produce would reduce the amount of capital available to businesses. After five years, the CBO says, the Obama proposals would reduce economic output by between 0.5 percent and 2.2 percent."
