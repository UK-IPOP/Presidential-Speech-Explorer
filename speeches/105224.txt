Mitt Romney today announced endorsements in Arizona.
"Arizona is an important state in my campaign and I am thrilled to receive the support of so many outstanding leaders from this great state," said Mitt Romney. "We will work together to spread the message of economic growth, job creation, and fiscal responsibility."
"We are facing a critical time in our nation's history. Millions of Americans are suffering under the current failed economic policies of President Obama. I know Mitt Romney has the experience, vision and plan to get Americans back to work," said Paul Gilbert, Romney Arizona Co-Chair.
"Governor Romney understands America's free enterprise system and how it can work for everyone. He has a well-defined plan for returning our great country to full employment. He has demonstrated his abilities to fix difficult situations throughout his business career, including turning around a failing Olympic effort into one of the most successful games ever, and his governorship of Massachusetts," said Romney Arizona Co-Chair Jim Click.
"President Obama has led this country in the wrong direction. Our national debt is out of control and his policies have stifled job creation. It's time to elect a leader with real experience to turn this economy around and put Americans back to work," said Arizona Secretary of State Ken Bennett.
"Mitt Romney is the only candidate with the vision, experience and leadership to get this economy moving again," said Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne. "His experience is unparalleled and he has what it takes to create jobs and get spending under control."
