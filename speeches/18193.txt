Dear John:
I am sure that no President ever received more dependable advice and assistance than you have given me during the period of almost eight years since I called you back from St. Louis in April 1945, to join my administration.
Your service as Federal Loan Administrator, as Director of the Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion, and finally as Secretary of the Treasury has been as beneficial to the country as it has been helpful to me personally. Your direction of the Government's fiscal affairs, your handling of many problems and responsibilities of international economic policy, and your outstanding leadership in the improvement of Government administration, all merit not only my own personal appreciation and that of your associates in the Government, but also the esteem of every citizen.
The judgment and understanding with which you have represented the United States--and on occasion, the President personally-in international consultations here and abroad have been other evidences of the honor and competence with which you filled a place of first importance in the public service.
I appreciate above all your unselfish and unfailing friendship.

Sincerely yours,

HARRY S, TRUMAN
