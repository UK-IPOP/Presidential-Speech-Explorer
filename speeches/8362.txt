I HAVE your telegram of September 7. You are entirely mistaken as to any connection between Admiral Hilary Jones and the gentleman you mention. They have never even had acquaintance and I have ample reason to know that there could not possibly be such a relationship as you suggest. I do hope that you will accept my assurance that there is a mistake. Admiral Jones deserves the highest appreciation for his public service.
HERBERT HOOVER
