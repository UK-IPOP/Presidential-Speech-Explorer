Gov. Rick Perry highlighted important legislation, passed during the 82nd Legislative Session that takes effect September 1, including a balanced budget that doesn't raise taxes, and key measures that protect the lives of the unborn and strengthen the state's legal climate, private property rights, and penalties for those convicted of human trafficking.
"This session we further strengthened our state's robust economy the way we said we would: by living within our means, balancing our budget without raising taxes and protecting the Rainy Day Fund," Gov. Perry said. "Texans can be proud of the steps we have taken to cut down on frivolous lawsuits; protect the lives of the unborn and the integrity of elections; strengthen private property rights and increase penalties for human traffickers and sex offenders who exploit the most vulnerable in our communities."
This past legislative session provided a balanced budget for the 2012-13 biennium without raising taxes, allocating more than half of state funds to education, preserving more than $6 billion in the state's Rainy Day Fund, and extending the tax exemption for small businesses to 2014, a measure Gov. Perry fought to continue, that will keep taxes low for thousands of employers across the state.
