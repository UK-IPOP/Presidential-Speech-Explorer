The County Executives of America (CEA) and International City/County Management Association (ICMA) joined a growing list of community organizations, state and local officials, and private sector leaders to implore Congress to take timely action to address the debt limit.
CEA Executive Director Michael Griffin said in a statement: "If the U.S. defaults and can no longer pay its obligations, billions of dollars in state aid and state-run, but federal funded programs could be halted.
Counties stand to lose funding from infrastructure to Medicaid, education dollars, nutrition, and Rescue Act relief, if the Federal government shuts down. The pandemic has put a huge burden on local governments. We are just beginning to see our way clear. We need to work together to find our way out of this situation. The County Executives of America implores the leadership of the Congress to raise the debt ceiling."
In a statement, ICMA said: "Cities and counties have been doing all they can to support the economic recovery, even as our communities have been buffeted by the pandemic and natural disasters. Maintaining our nation's creditworthiness is essential to avoid a financial crisis that would hurt virtually every corner of America."
