The President spoke separately today with President Hollande of France, Chancellor Merkel of Germany, Prime Minister Cameron of the United Kingdom, and High Representative Mogherini of the European Union to discuss the agreement among the P5+1, the European Union, and Iran on a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) regarding Iran's nuclear program. The President thanked the leaders for their important role in achieving this milestone, the culmination of nearly 20 months of intense negotiations. The leaders affirmed that the JCPOA represents an historic solution that will verifiably prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon by cutting off all of the potential pathways to a bomb while ensuring the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program going forward. The leaders committed to remain in close coordination as the JCPOA is operationalized. The President also welcomed Monday's agreement between Greece and its creditors. The President noted that the agreement is a positive step that could help to underpin a return to growth and debt stability in Greece, but that further work will be required.
