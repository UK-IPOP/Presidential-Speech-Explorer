Sir, Mr. Presidentâ€”Mr. President, can we have a reaction to your meeting with President Xi last night? Mr. President, can we have a reaction to your meeting with President Xi last night?
 Mr. President, can we have a reaction to your meeting with President Xi last night? How did it go?
 It was a good meeting. We've got a lot to follow up on. We set up four groups, and we're going to get our folks together on a whole range of issues.
I'll have more to report for you in the next 2 weeks.
Any progress on Taiwan?
 Yes. We have made very clear we support the Taiwan Act, and that's it. It's independent. It makes its own decisions.
How about a Fed Chair nominee? Any closer to a decision?
 Yes, as my grandfather would say, "with the grace of God and the good will of the neighbors," you're going to hear that in about 4 days.
 Okay.
