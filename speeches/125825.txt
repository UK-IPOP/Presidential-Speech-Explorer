NEW YORK â€“ 
"I support legislation by Sen. Chuck Schumer that would allow Americans, including the families of victims of the 9/11 attacks, to use U.S. courts to determine if foreign entities are culpable for terrorist attacks in the United States and seek restitution for the damages and lives lost."
"I also believe it is time to declassify the 28-page section of the 9/11 Commission Report on the potential sources of foreign support received by the hijackers. The families of those lost on that terrible day have the right to review any evidence that connects the hijackers to foreign supporters, including potentially those in Saudi Arabia as former Chairman Bob Graham of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has suggested may be the case. If no such connection exists, then our country deserves the information necessary to put that speculation behind us.
"I understand that the Obama administration is conducting a review to declassify that section of the commission report, and I would urge them to declassify this information as soon as possible."
