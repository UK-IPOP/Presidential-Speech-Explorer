WASHINGTON, DC -- This week, members of the Cabinet and senior White House officials are scheduled to participate alongside teachers and volunteers in the first National Lab Day, a historic grassroots effort to bring hands-on learning activities to thousands of students and improve science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education. National Lab Day is a grassroots partnership between science and engineering societies and educators and was launched in response to President Obama's call at the National Academy of Sciences last spring for all Americans to join the cause of elevating STEM education as a national priority. The first annual National Lab Day is Wednesday, May 12th, though National Lab Day projects are taking place in schools throughout the year.  Cabinet Secretaries and senior administration officials scheduled to participate this week include:

National Lab Day, a grassroots partnership between science and engineering societies and educators, was launched in response to President Obama's call at the National Academy of Sciences last spring for all Americans to join the cause of elevating STEM education as a national priority. National Lab Day has strong financial support from the Hidary Foundation, MacArthur Foundation, Gates Foundation and partners such as HP and Motorola, and seeks to bring hands-on learning to students by upgrading science labs, supporting project-based learning and building communities of support for STEM teachers. In less than six months, National Lab Day has created over 1700 projects, matched 11,000 teachers and volunteers and made over 69,000 connections between volunteers and supporting organizations and resources to help bring discovery-based science experiences to students in grades K-12.
As part of these events, the MacArthur Foundation, a National Lab Day partner, will announce the winners of its "21st Century Learning Lab Designers" competition, part of the $2 million DML Prize, a first-ever competition challenging entrepreneurs to design new hands-on STEM learning.
National Lab Day has projects in every state, as well as Puerto Rico, Guam, US Virgin Islands, and last week received a broad and bipartisan resolution of support (378-2) from the U.S. House of Representatives. To learn more about National Lab Day, visit
