 All right, well, never mind. See, every once in a while, hideous threats have a clarifying effect. And sometimes they make people make important choices, and apparently the threat of my singing has persuaded the President of the United States to intervene on yet another mission of peace.
Mr. President.
 Dee Dee, how are you doing?
 Mr. President.
 Marlin, you're looking as pretty as ever.
 Thank you, Mr. President. Really good to see you.
 Sarah, good to see you.
 How are you?
 Jim, really good to see you, sir. Thank you.
 Nice seeing you too.
 Speech, speech.
 Press conference.
 Welcome, Mr. President.
 We have a few questions, if you don't mind.
 Just a couple of questions.
 I know you've been complaining about the digs for a while. [
] So this is like the end of an old era. And let me just say, we felt your pain. And so we decided, you know, to help you renovate and come up with a new Brady center.
And so I want to thank the former spinmeisters for joining me up here. Tell my people how to do it, will you? I mean, it's a—[
].
But anyway, Laura and I wanted to come by and wish you all the best as you get to move headquarters for a while. I look forward to welcome you back here in, I guess, 6 or 7 months. Is that right?
 Nine months. We hope.
 We're setting no timetables, Mr. President. [
]
 That's what you get when you bring your crackpot up from Texas. [
]
 No comment, sir. [
]
 So, like, suede chairs? [
] Is that what you're looking— kind of velvet armchairs? Armchairs. Everybody wants to be able to lean back.
It looks a little crowded in here. And so you want to double the size?
 Yes.
 Forget it. [
] You get to work like the rest of us. We may have some air conditioning if we decide to. [
]
Anyway, good luck in the new building. Looking forward to seeing you over there.
 Can we come see you?
 I don't know. Does the air conditioner work better there than here? [
]
 Yes.
 The last time I had a press conference in here, it felt like it was outside. As a matter of fact, some of your makeup was running. [
]
 Mr. President, should Mel Gibson be forgiven? [
]
 Is that you and Gregory [David Gregory, NBC News] standing back there?
 I was there first. [
]
 You know——
 ——complaining that the Jews start all the wars——
 Is that Sam Donaldson? [
] Forget it. You're a has-been. We don't have to answer has-been's questions.
 Ooh!
 Mr. President, do you want to say a little about the White House press corps, please?
 Say something about the White House press corps?
 Yes, sir.
 It's a beautiful bunch of people. [
]
 How about your best moment in here, sir? Can you remember your——
 My best moment in here is when my press conference ended. [
]
 [
]—about Mel Gibson——
 I can't hear you; I'm over 60, just like you. [
]
 ——Ronald Reagan could get away with that, sir.
 He was over 60 as well. At any rate, as you can tell, I'm thrilled to be here. [
] But we do wish you all the best. Looking forward to being here when you kick off the new room. You deserve better than this. I appreciate the relationship with the press. I know these folks enjoyed the—enjoyed dealing with you—well, another crowd of you, been dealing with you as well. It's an important relationship.
 Some of the same crowd.
 Well, you're the head of the whole thing. Like, have you got a thing—a role to play?
 No, no, no.
 Okay, good. But anyway, good luck.
 What about Crawford?
 For those of you going to Crawford, saddle up. All right, good to see you.
 Thank you, everybody.
