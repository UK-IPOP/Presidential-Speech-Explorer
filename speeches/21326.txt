I have asked Mr. Nixon to participate in a fifth debate which I think should cover the question of Cuba and other important problems facing the American people.
I still find it impossible to understand why Mr. Nixon wants to limit the debate to one subject where there are so many important problems facing the American people. I think the fifth debate should include all questions which the members of the press [panel] feel are of importance.
As to Mr. Nixon's latest lengthy telegram today, I think the American people will well be able to judge which candidate has been guilty of distortions in this campaign. They will render their decision on November 8 and I have the greatest confidence in that decision.
Mr. Nixon's message is another indication of the fact that he would rather debate with mimeograph machines and telegrams than face to face.
I plan to appear at the fifth debate prepared to answer any questions which the panel may wish to ask me. I hope he will appear prepared to do the same thing.
