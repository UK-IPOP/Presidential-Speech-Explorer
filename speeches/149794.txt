Good afternoon from the White House. I'll be your print pooler on this chilly autumn day. The White House says the press briefing will now start at 1:15 p.m.
More TK!
Two minute warning on briefing.
The briefing kicked off at 1:43 p.m. It wrapped at 2:44 p.m.
The pool is gathering for the reproductive rights event.
The White House website has a steaming link, so I'll just be sending color.
At 3:38 p.m., pool was led into the State Dining room. The president and VP are seated at a large table with about 20 cabinet officials and doctors.
VP Harris kicked off the meeting, calling out "extremist so-called leaders" in Arizona and Wisconsin, as examples.
The event is ongoing ...
President Biden started speaking at 3:45 p.m.
"Folks, what century are we in?" He asked at one point.
"My Lord, we're talking about contraception here."
"Don't, please don't," he said to colleges contemplating limiting contraception.
At 3:50 p.m., Secretary Cardona took over, followed by the medical experts.
At 4:11, pool was pulled out - Biden mouthed something, but it didn't appear to be in response to the chorus of questions that was shouted.
The White House called a lid at 4:20 p.m.
Have a wonderful night!
