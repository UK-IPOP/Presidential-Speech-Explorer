In 1999, Governor Jeb Bush established the Florida Office of Drug Control within the Governor's office, ensuring the state's efforts were coordinated and prioritized. Columba Bush subsequently became the spokesperson for substance abuse prevention in Florida, and today remains a national advocate for promoting substance abuse prevention, treatment and awareness.
Throughout his administration, Governor Bush remained committed to decreasing drug use, reducing recidivism, expanding the Florida drug court system, expanding drug abuse treatment and raising awareness of this tragic issue.
 The Florida Youth Substance Abuse Survey, which was given for the first time in 1999, shows drug usage decreased across the board between 2000 and 2006:
 Florida has been a pioneer with respect to drug courts, specialized courts that are proven to reduce recidivism by addressing low-level drug crimes through monitored treatment and testing rather than incarceration. Governor Bush tripled the number of drug courts in Florida, deeply integrating them into Florida's criminal justice system.
