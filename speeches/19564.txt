Dear Mr. Chairman:
I have received your letter of January eighth. I believe that I have dealt with the substantive matters which it contains in my message of January twelfth. Should further study of your letter indicate that additional response is appropriate, I shall communicate with you at a later date.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
