Greetings from a chilly Washington, DC where the White House has called a travel/photo lid at 10:10 am.
Enjoy your Sunday!
Greetings again from a very chilly White House where there has been a change of plans.
POTUS will be leaving for Delaware this evening at 5:00 pm.
His new schedule is below.
One lid is lifted, and another is called. Luch lid until 4:30.
I just realized I labeled In-Town report as Travel report. It should be In-Town Pool Report.
Change in plans
From a White House official:
The President had a family-related issue that was going to take him to Wilmington, DE tonight but he will no longer be going and will remain in Washington, DC tonight.
Here is the new schedule now that POTUS is remaining in DC
On Sunday, the President will remain at the White House and has no public events scheduled.
