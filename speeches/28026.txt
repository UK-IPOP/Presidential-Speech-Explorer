AT MY request, the Administrator of General Services today issued the attached regulation which requires that federally owned vehicles use low-lead or unleaded gasoline whenever this is practical and feasible. The purposes of this regulation are twofold: to reduce air pollution and to increase the market for low-lead and unleaded gasoline, in order to make such fuels more generally available.
I have also today written to the Governors of our 50 States suggesting that they take similar steps in their administrations. If all government agencies--Federal, State, and local--were to adopt this policy, we could not only reduce pollution, but we could also provide a sizable incentive for production and distribution of low or unleaded fuels and thus make them more readily available.
