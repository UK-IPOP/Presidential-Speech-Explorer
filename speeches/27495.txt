I approve the recommendation of the Office of Emergency Planning and the recommendations of the Secretaries of Treasury, Defense, and Commerce, the Acting Secretary of State, and the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers regarding the release of 150,000 tons of copper from the national stockpile.
In accordance with the provisions of section 5 of the Strategic and Critical Materials Stockpiling Act, as amended (50 U.S.C. 98d), and based on the recommendations mentioned above and the opinion of the Acting Attorney General, I herewith determine that such release is required for purposes of the common defense. Disposals should be made through regular producer channels solely for defense and defense supporting users, as necessary. Disposals should be made on a periodic basis in such a way as to facilitate the orderly distribution of copper supplies to fulfill defense needs.
The efforts initiated by me in March 1966 to make satisfactory arrangements for replenishment of the copper supply in the national stockpile at the earliest practicable future date and to expand domestic copper production through selective use of Government programs available for that purpose, should be continued on an accelerated basis.
