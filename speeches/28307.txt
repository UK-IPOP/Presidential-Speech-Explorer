Dear Tom:
I deeply regret that you will be leaving the government, but I accept your resignation as Administrator of NASA effective September 15, as you have requested.
You have earned the gratitude of every one of your fellow citizens many times over for the outstanding leadership you have given to the nation's space programs. Your contribution to man's knowledge of the Earth as well as the heavens has been major, and the course you have done so much to set will help guide our efforts for years to come. The respect and affection of the colleagues and associates you leave behind will accompany you wherever you go, and I hope you will always take pride in your splendid achievements in behalf of every American and, indeed, in behalf of all mankind.
You have earned a unique and permanent place of honor in the history of man's exploration. It has been a privilege to know you, and to work with you, and to share with you the sense of excitement, adventure and achievement that has marked this time of triumph in the nation's space program.
With warm personal regards,

Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
[Dr. Thomas Paine, Administrator of NASA]
