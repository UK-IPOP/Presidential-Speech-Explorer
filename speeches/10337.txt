I THANK Your Serene Highness for the cordial expression of good wishes contained in your radio telegram inaugurating the new system of direct communication between Hungary and the United States. Rapid communication of information and ideas between nations is one of the most valuable means of fostering international understanding. I trust that this new means of communication between Hungary and the United States will serve to maintain the friendly relations so happily existing between the two countries.
HERBERT HOOVER
[His Serene Highness, The Regent of the Kingdom of Hungary, Budapest, Hungary]
