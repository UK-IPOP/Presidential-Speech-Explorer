Marine One lifted off from the South Lawn at 7:14 am.

Traveling with the President on Marine One en route to Rehoboth Beach, Delaware:




Upon listening to the video playback, here are the better POTUS quotes:

Also pooler has inquired if POTUS tested negative for Covid this morning and will pass along any update received.

The pool is back on the bus and should be rolling shortly.
