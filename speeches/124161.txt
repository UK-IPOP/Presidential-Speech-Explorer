These photos tell the story of Hillary for Iowa.
For the last nine months, the Hillary for Iowa team has been using the hashtag #ISpyIowa to document their travels across the Hawkeye State as they canvassed, phone banked, and organized to help Hillary Clinton win the Iowa caucus.
There is nothing more beautiful than engaging with purpose, organizing with heart, and winning every single day.
