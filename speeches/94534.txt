AUSTIN, TX - Texans for Hillary today announced the endorsement of several Rio Grande Valley elected officials, a list of supporters that continues to grow. In a show of support, the Rio Grande Valley elected officials stood behind Hillary Wednesday at her South Texas Kick-off Event in McAllen.
"The people of the Rio Grande Valley know Hillary Clinton, view her as an adopted Texan, and have witnessed first-hand her commitment to improve their quality of life. They know that she is the best candidate to deliver solutions in the future, because she has been delivering needed change to their lives for over 30 years," Congressman Ruben Hinojosa said.
"Hillary will work to fix our economy, expand access to affordable health care, and protecting our nation's soldiers. We stand with Hillary because she has and will continue to stand with us. They know she did not have to discover South Texas on a map when it came time to run for President. I think South Texas will play a big part in helping her carry Texas on March 4th. "
