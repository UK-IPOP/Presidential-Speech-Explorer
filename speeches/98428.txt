ARLINGTON, VA -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today released its latest television ad, entitled "Alaska Maverick." The ad highlights Governor Sarah Palin's record of taking on the special interests in Alaska and bringing reform and change. While Barack Obama talks about change, Governor Sarah Palin has actually done it. The ad will air in key states.

"For starters, we'd say Governor Palin's credentials as an agent of reform exceed Barack Obama's. Mr. Obama rose through the Chicago Democratic machine without a peep of push-back. Alaska's politics are deeply inbred and backed by energy-industry money. Mr. Obama slid past the kind of forces that Mrs. Palin took head on." (Editorial, "A Reform Ticket," 
, 8/30/08) 
 
• 
 "It is true, as the statement said, that Palin has a record of bipartisan reform. She has a growing reputation as a maverick for bucking her party's establishment and Alaska's powerful oil industry." (Ron Fournier, "Analysis: Palin's Age, Inexperience Rival Obama's,"

"Palin took on the oil producers, especially Exxon Mobil, saying they had been dragging their feet on a gasline. She persuaded the Legislature to pass a bill authorizing an independent company to build the line with state subsidy." (Tom Kizzia, "The Joan Of Arc Of Alaska Politics,"

 "Since moving into the governor's mansion in Juneau in December of 2006, Palin has earned a reputation as a reformer who worked with both Democrats and Republicans to overhaul the state oil-tax system and to restore confidence in state government shaken by political-corruption scandals."
