I AM deeply gratified that agreement was reached last night on a new government in the Dominican Republic. While there are still grave problems to be faced by the Dominican people, the way has been opened for an end to strife and for the choice of leaders through the process which all free men cherish. The hopes of democratic and peaceful men the whole world over have taken new strength and nourishment from these events today.
The road to peace and freedom is always hard, and wherever this road is being traveled successfully, there can always be found many men and women who have given of themselves and of their talents in great measure. The Dominican Republic is no exception, and there have been many who have done just this. All democratic elements in the hemisphere are indebted to the Dominican leaders who have worked for this agreement, to Ambassadors Penna Marinho, Clairmont Duenas, and Bunker for their outstanding statesmanship, and to the many others who contributed so much in order that this achievement could be made possible.
