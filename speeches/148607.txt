It's critical to quickly confirm Federal Reserve vice chair nominee 
 because "the potential for significant cyber impacts is ever more apparent and urgent," former cyber officials write in a letter to Senate leaders shared with the Cybersecurity 202.
Senate Republicans have 
 Raskin's nomination as they scrutinize her role on a financial technology firm's board. Raskin led an initiative as deputy secretary of the Treasury Department during the Obama administration to standardize approaches to cybersecurity in the financial sector among G-7 nations.
The letter was signed by former White House cybersecurity coordinator 
, former DHS deputy secretary 
, former DHS undersecretary 
 and former State Department cyber coordinator 
. It was addressed to the Senate Majority Leader 
 (D-N.Y.) and Minority Leader 
 (R-Ky.), as well as top lawmakers on the Senate Banking Committee, where her nomination has stalled.
