THERE IS being transmitted to Congress today the first list of public building projects under the enlarged program authorized by the act of March 31, 1930, which extended general authorization for new building construction from $338 million to $568 million, to be spread over about 10 years. These expenditures have been rendered necessary to finally overcome the long delays in provision of quarters for Federal activities during recovery from the war, and are imperative for the more economical carrying on of the Federal agencies.
The sums required for the next fiscal year's expenditure have been included in our estimates of receipts and expenditures which were transmitted by letter to the chairmen of the Senate Finance Committee and the House Appropriations Committee.
About 200 cities and towns are represented in the program. Concerted effort will be made to place contracts for the building contemplated for this year as rapidly as possible. Land is now owned in more than 50 places named and directly the approval of Congress is given for specific location of these buildings, steps will be taken toward acquiring sites in other designated places.
Since the passage of the Public Buildings Act of May 25, 1926, Congress has specifically authorized and appropriated for 327 projects. Of this number 117 buildings are either under contract or have been completed. Drawings are now being prepared for 88 buildings, which are expected to be placed under contract during this calendar year. Submission at this time of these additional projects for specific authorization and appropriation will afford employment for many thousands of men engaged in the building trades and allied industries.
