The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsements of Annapolis Mayor Ellen Moyer and more than 30 mayors, legislators and community leaders.
"Hillary Clinton knows how to work through the system and bring about the change this country needs," said Mayor Moyer. "She has the strength and experience to do the job from her first day in the White House, and those are the qualities we need."
"Two words sum up the reasons for my support of Hillary Clinton: toughness and experience," said Delegate Ben Barnes. "For almost two decades, she has stood in the face of the Republican attack machine, not just holding her ground, but fighting back for us. That toughness and resilience, coupled with her years of experience fighting for health care, the environment and working people, make her the clear choice to be our next President."
"Hillary's commitment to education reform and universal pre-K, coupled with her strength and experience, will set this country back on the right path," said Nancy Navarro, President of the Montgomery County Board of Education.
"I'm honored to have the support of these local leaders from across Maryland," Clinton said. "With their help, we will continue to grow our grassroots organization throughout the state."
