The Administration supports H.R. 372, the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act of 2017. Many Americans have seen their health insurance premiums increase, and healthcare options decrease, significantly under the Affordable Care Act. The Administration supports efforts to restore competition to the health insurance marketplace in order to lower costs and expand choices for consumers.

H.R. 372 would amend the McCarran-Ferguson Act to ensure that Federal antitrust laws apply to the business of health insurance. The bill supports the goal of giving American families and businesses more control over their own healthcare choices by promoting greater health insurance competition. The bill would specifically prohibit businesses from engaging in anti-competitive practices, including price fixing, bid rigging, and market allocation that could drive up healthcare costs.
