My dear Mr. Justice:
I am in receipt of your letter of January 12th tendering your resignation from the Supreme Court of the United States. I must, of course, accept it.
No appreciation I could express would even feebly represent the gratitude of the American people for your whole life of wonderful public service, from the time you were an officer in the Civil War to this day-near your ninety-first anniversary. I know of no American retiring from public service with such a sense of affection and devotion of the whole people.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Honorable Oliver Wendell Holmes, Supreme Court of the United States, Washington, D.C.]
