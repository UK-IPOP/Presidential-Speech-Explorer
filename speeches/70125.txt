 Mr. President, are there any thoughts you'd care to share with us, now, as you sit down with the Holy Father?
 Well, we have a lot of things to discuss, so I'm looking forward to it. We're going to talk about many places in the world, and I'm anxious to hear his thoughts on his recent trip to Mexico. And then I expect we'll go through a lot of other hot spots in the world.
 How has his advice affected your decisions so far in your Presidency?
 He reminds us to think of the people, not just the governments of other countries but the people of other countries. And that's an important thing for an American President to keep in mind.
