 Wow! Oh, hold on. My phone is ringing. Just a second—oh, my gosh! Look at who is calling. Whoa!
Hello? Hello, Mr. President?

 Hello, Al. How you doing, pal?
 Hi, happy Thanksgiving.
 Oh, Dr. Biden and Mr. President, thank you so much. Happy Thanksgiving to you. How—how are you?
 A New York firefighter!
 [
] That's right. We had a New York firefighter here. [
] And it's so good—good for you calling. We thank you so much.
What's your message to the American folks on this Thanksgiving Day?
 My message is, after 2 years, you're back. America is back. There's nothing we're unable to overcome, Al. And you're one of the reasons for that, pal. You're always up. You're always rooting.
 Well, we appreciate it, Mr. President. Thank you so much. I hope you're going to continue to watch the parade. Santa is coming! Santa is coming——
 Okay!
 We are!
——Mr. President! [

 I'm waiting for Santa. [

 All right. Well, listen, happy Thanksgiving to both of you, from our family to yours. Thank you, thank you, and happy Thanksgiving.
 Thank you. Wish we were there with you, Al.
 Yes.
 Nice to see you, pal.
 All right.
 Happy Thanksgiving.
 [
] Thank you. I wonder, how did he get my phone number? Well, he's the President of the United States. I guess he can do that.
