My dear Mrs. Hadden:
I appreciate very warmly what you and the members of the Girl's Service League of America have done in cooperation with the President's Emergency Committee for Employment. This work has been of the greatest social value besides its obvious humanitarian aspects. I will be obliged if you will convey to your associates my cordial thanks.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mrs. Alexander M. Hadden, President, Girl's Service League of America, 138 East Nineteenth Street, New York, N.Y.]
