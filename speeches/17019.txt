On the occasion of the Jewish New Year I extend greetings to all Americans of the Jewish faith.
I hope that your observance will renew in each of you a devotion to the cause of peace and a determination to help advance the welfare of your fellow men in accordance with the ancient spiritual and moral teachings of your religion. To people of every persuasion these teachings are a continuing guide in the search for justice and good will among nations and a better life for men, women, and children everywhere in the world.
