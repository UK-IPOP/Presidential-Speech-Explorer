[ Released June 2, 1960. Dated June 1, 1960 ]
Dear Wallace:
Thank you for your May twenty-fifth letter with your observations on the allocation of possible 1960 domestic area sugar quota deficits. I also noted in the May twenty-seventh Congressional Record your comments made on the Senate Floor on the same subject.
Whether or not it would be determined to reallocate such deficits in a manner different from that now provided by law, I nevertheless attach particular importance to the recommendation that the President be given appropriate authority to adjust certain foreign quotas when he finds such action is called for--either in the national interest or to insure adequate domestic supplies of sugar. I hope most earnestly that Congress will act promptly on the sugar legislation recommended last March by this Administration, and I very much appreciate your own efforts, as well as the efforts of your colleagues joined with you, to see that the necessary legislative action on this subject is taken quickly.
With warm regard,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
