The Administration supports H.R. 1757. However, the Administration will seek improvements in the bill as it continues through the legislative process. For example, the Administration has concerns about the provision in section 5 which restricts the use of Federal experimental test bed networks when commercial networks are available. This provision would limit needed flexibility to develop advanced networking technologies.
