To the Congress of the United States:
I am submitting herewith for your consideration a copy of the report of the Porto Rican Hurricane Relief Commission recommending that additional funds be made available to the Commission for the purposes specified therein. I am also submitting a draft of the legislation proposed by the Commission to accomplish these purposes.
Porto Rico is still suffering from the effects of the disastrous hurricane of September 13, 1928. There exists a real and immediate need for appropriating these funds in order to alleviate the distress due to unemployment on the Island and to enable the Commission to continue its farm rehabilitation program.
The proposed legislation has my approval and I recommend its immediate enactment.
HERBERT HOOVER
