"President Obama campaigned on a promise to change Washington — but with his failed record under increasing scrutiny, he's resorted to the same, false attacks typical of Washington politicians. America deserves better and a president who's willing to tell the truth." —Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson

 "Second, the charge itself is suspect. The independent group 
 investigated the Post's allegations - and the Obama campaign's ads citing the Post as a source. Their conclusion: ' ... we found no evidence to support the claim that Romney - while he was still running Bain Capital - shipped American jobs overseas.'" (Steve Sebelius, "No Reason To Outsource The Truth In Ads,"

 "The in-depth 
 report looked at each of the companies mentioned in the Post story to conclude that either the outsourcing took place after Romney left the company, that it couldn't be accurately determined whether American jobs were lost to foreign countries, or the charges were unsupported by the evidence."

 "But after reviewing numerous corporate filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, contemporary news accounts, company histories and press releases, and the evidence offered by both the Obama and Romney campaigns, we found no evidence to support the claim that Romney — while he was still running Bain Capital — shipped American jobs overseas."

 "Yet the campaign clearly seized on this report because their interpretation fit with a long-term "outsourcing" attack they have waged against Romney. One of their outsourcing ads before the article ran, in fact, earned Four Pinocchios. These new ads would not fare much better; there is little in the Post article that backs up the Obama campaign's spin." (Glenn Kessler, "Obama's New Attacks On Romney And Outsourcing," 
, 7/2/12)
 "And after reviewing evidence cited by the Obama campaign, we reaffirm our conclusion that Romney left the helm of Bain Capital when he took a leave of absence in 1999 to run the Salt Lake City Organizing Committee for the 2002 Winter Olympics — as he has said repeatedly — and never returned to active management. The Obama campaign's recent ads thus mislead when they point to investments made by Bain, as well as management decisions made by companies in which Bain invested, after that time." (Brooks Jackson and Robert Farley, with Eugene Kiely, "FactCheck To Obama Camp: Your Complaint is All Wet,"

 "The Obama campaign fails to make its case. On just about every level, this ad is misleading, unfair and untrue, from the use of 'corporate raider' to its examples of alleged outsourcing. Simply repeating the same debunked claims won't make them any more correct." (Glenn Kessler, "4 Pinocchios For Obama's Newest Anti-Romney Ad,"

 "While White House officials say they have been waiting on Congress to act, Obama's critics, primarily on the political left, say he has repeatedly failed in other ways to protect American jobs from being moved overseas."

 "But Obama's critics say the most important step the president could take — but hasn't — is to declare China a 'currency manipulator,' which could ultimately allow the U.S. government to erect tariffs to protect American industries."

 "According to some critics, a galling example of the Obama administration fostering overseas work came as part the 2009 stimulus program. They point to millions of dollars meant to develop a domestic clean-energy industry that instead landed in the hands of foreign businesses."
