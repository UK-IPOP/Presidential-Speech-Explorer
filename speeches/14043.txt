 improvements in modes of ocean transportation during the last one hundred and fifty years have opened possibilities, new in history, of mutually profitable intercourse and closer relations between peoples; and
 a signal event in this technical progress was the first successful ocean passage by a steam-propelled vessel, the Savannah, which departed from Savannah, Georgia, May 22, 1819; and
 in World War II the seamen of the United States Merchant Marine displayed splendid heroism, under stress and under hazard in the waters of every ocean, in meeting the demands on them in the colossal task of supply which was so essential to our victory; and
 in peace no less than in war the Merchant Marine makes a vital contribution to the welfare of the Nation; and
 the Congress by a joint resolution approved May 20, 1933 (48 Stat. 73) designated May 22 of each year as National Maritime Day and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe that day:
 President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people of the United States to observe May 22, 1946 as National Maritime Day by displaying the flag at their homes or other suitable places, and I direct that the flag be displayed on all Government buildings on that day.
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 13th day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventieth.
