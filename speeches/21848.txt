Dear Mr. Prime Minister:
Upon the accession to independence of the Republic of Niger, I extend in my own name and on behalf of the United States most cordial greetings and felicitations to you and the people of Niger.
The United States has followed with great interest the progress of Niger towards independence and welcomes with deep satisfaction this historic event which was achieved in friendly cooperation with France.
On this memorable day the Government and the people of the United States look forward to close and friendly relations with the Government and people of Niger.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
