A MAJOR program segment of our manpower policy is already beginning to pay its own way. Secretary of Labor Wirtz has reported to me that the average trainee in the on-the-job training programs developed by the Labor Department is returning the total cost of his training to the Treasury in less than 2 years. There will continue to be dividends for many years to come.
We welcome the fiscal integrity of these programs.
We also welcome the individual dividends paid. Through these training programs tens of thousands of jobless workers are becoming productive citizens. Their dignity and self-respect are being restored.
On-the-job training is an example of a sound economic and social investment. It illustrates clearly how the Nation and the individual may benefit from the wise use of the national wealth.
