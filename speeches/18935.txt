I AM SURE the Nation shares with me a keen disappointment in the failure of the steel companies and the Steel Workers Union to reach agreement on a new contract.
The fact that the contract expired without agreement having been reached does not in any way relieve the parties of responsibility to continue to bargain without interruption.
The services of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service have always been available, and I recommend that the parties immediately call the Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service for assistance.
I am confident that with good will on both sides of the bargaining table, agreement can be reached without undue delay. The American people have a deep concern in these negotiations and will rightly expect steady progress toward a just and responsible settlement.
