The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 240 as introduced, making appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015, and for other purposes.
The Administration appreciates the Congress' continued robust funding of the Department, including support for important Federal cybersecurity initiatives, disaster relief and recovery programs, and essential law enforcement activities. These funds are critical for ensuring the Department can help keep our Nation safe from harm.
However, the Administration strongly opposes the addition of any amendments to the legislation that would place restrictions on the Department's ability to set smart enforcement priorities focused on criminals, national security threats, and recent border crossers, hold undocumented immigrants accountable, and modernize the legal immigration system. The President's immigration accountability executive actions strengthen our border security, ensure undocumented immigrants who are parents of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents pass background checks to obtain temporary relief from removal, and require everyone to play by the same rules.

The President looks forward to working with the Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform and an appropriations bill funding the Department of Homeland Security that is free from ideological provisions.
