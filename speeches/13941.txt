[ Released June 28, 1946. Dated June 27, 1946]
Dear Mr. Appleby:
I have today signed an executive order terminating effective June 30, 1946, the Director of Liquidation created pursuant to Executive Order No. 9674 of January 4, 1946.
The primary function of the Director of Liquidation, that of assisting the emergency war agencies in developing suitable plans for the winding up or retrenchment of their affairs, has been substantially accomplished. There are, however, many problems which will arise when the emergency agencies now in existence are terminated.
In terminating the Director of Liquidation I am asking that you assume under your general authority in the field of management, the responsibilities formerly vested in the Director.
The problems anent personnel, property and records will, I believe, present the most perplexing issues in liquidation. In dealing with the agencies, I feel you should concentrate much of your effort in these fields.
For your information there is attached a copy of the report of the Director of Liquidation which he recently submitted to me.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Honorable Paul H. Appleby, Acting Director, Bureau of the Budget, Washington, D.C.]
