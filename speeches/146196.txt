Following the House passage of the Build Back Better Act, Governors, Mayors, state legislators, county executives, Tribal leaders, and other local elected officials applauded how the historic legislation will lower costs for middle- and working-class families, create good-paying, union jobs, and turn the climate crisis into an opportunity to build a more resilient future.
As Nobel Prize-winning economists and independent ratings agencies have confirmed, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Build Back Better Act are fully paid for, will reduce the deficit, and ease inflationary pressures by making the wealthiest individuals and corporations pay their fair share and stopping them from cheating on their tax bills.
Governors, mayors, state legislators, Tribal leaders, and other local leaders from across the country are applauding the passage of the historic legislation through the House and call on the Senate to take urgent action so President Biden can sign it into law and ensure we can build back better.
"@POTUS's #BuildBackBetter is CA values on the national stage. It will add to our unprecedented investments to support middle class families, invest in clean energy, & increase access to health care & housing while creating jobs. Now, let's get it done.

 "My colleagues and I are thrilled that the House has advanced the Build Back Better Act, a giant leap toward becoming law. The bill will transform our nation for decades to come. It will improve access to economic prosperity through provisions that strengthen health care, affordable housing, child care, and employment. For example, the package includes four weeks of paid family leave -- a revolutionary provision to strengthen families and help working parents maintain their jobs. The package will also create more than one million affordable homes, allocate significant funding to youth apprenticeship programs, provide additional money for programs that serve out-of-school youth in high-crime and high-poverty areas, and fund employment activities for justice-involved young adults who have dropped out of school. The Build Back Better Act delivers on the president's commitments to communities of color. Now, the Senate must act and send the bill to the president's desk so that we can begin to make some of our most intractable racial justice issues vestiges of the past." [Press Release, 11/19/21]
