The Hillary Clinton for President Campaign today announced its Oklahoma Steering Committee, made up of over forty community leaders from across the state who will mobilize grassroots support for Hillary, leading up to Oklahoma's February 5th primary.
Capitalizing on the momentum from Tuesday's victory in the New Hampshire Primary, the campaign is ready to compete for every vote in Oklahoma.
"Hillary's broad and diverse statewide steering committee demonstrates her strength and support throughout the Sooner State, said former Attorney General Mike Turpen. "Hillary Clinton has a proven track record of making change happen, not just talking about it. That's the sort of leadership Oklahoma families are looking for to move our country forward."
"Hillary embodies the hopes and dreams of people across the country and has the experience to deliver on the issues important to families across Oklahoma," added Secretary of State Susan Savage.
