"The fact that they have made some progress on the ground is going to enable them to move some of the forces out, and that's ultimately the kind of thing that we want to be able to see throughout Iraq. As the President said all along, the idea is to build greater Iraqi capability, and when the time comes, to be able to move folks out."
 (Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV), Statement, 2/21/07)
 "Instead of escalating against the express will of Congress and the American people, the President should follow the advice of military leaders and the bipartisan Iraq Study Group and change course in Iraq." (Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV), Statement, 2/21/07)
