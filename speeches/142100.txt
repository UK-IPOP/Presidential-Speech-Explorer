Pool Reports by

Good morning from the White House, where it's chilly and clear. The pool has been tested for covid.
The current schedule for the day: An 11a covid briefing, a 12:30 press briefing, and remarks on the American Rescue Plan by POTUS at 1:45 pm.
I'll update with any changes.
The 11a covid briefing is scheduled to begin now. You can watch here.
At 11:35, the WH called a lunch lid until 12:15.
... at 12:45 pm.
At 2p, a 2-minute warning for POTUS remarks in the State Dining Room
POTUS entered the State Dining Room at 2:02 pm and began his remarks, which you can stream live.
He strode alone to the podium, wearing a diagonally striped tie, and took off his mask before he spoke.
POTUS wrapped his prepared remarks at 2:10. As he stepped away from the podium, he heard one shouted question, on whether former President Trump should play a role in encouraging vaccines, and returned to the podium to answer it.
POTUS then left the podium about 2:11 and ignored a chorus of shouted questions.
We have a travel/photo lid as of 3:27p.
