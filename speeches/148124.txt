Pool Reports by 
, 
Greetings from the WH, where the Olympic Theme can be heard near a security tent set up beyond the North Lawn.
You have probably seen one change to the sked this AM: POTUS will now speak from the Roosevelt Room about the economy at 11.
The outdoor event with Team USA is still set for 11:30, which is before predicted rain.
Your pooler spotted Commander on a leash outside the West Wing on the way in.
A White House official sends this out re: last night's Ohio primary:
"Last night, President Biden called both Shontel Brown and Tim Ryan to congratulate each of them on their primary victories in Ohio."
Two minute warning in the Roosevelt room.
Potus began with a hello and said he wouldn't be able to do many questions with 600 Olympians outside.
He took 2: on sanctions and abortion.
He began prepared remarks, using a promoter, stressing deficit reduction in his tenure.
"It's gone down both years that I've been here period."
He cited the AC√Å, vaccine shots and other actions.
"We recovered faster than projected"
He tore into MAGA, and this time mentioned Rick Scott by name when speaking about his tax plans.
"It's a maga agenda alright"
"It's extreme as most maga things are"
He brought up $350b deficit reduction in his first year.
"I don't want to hear Republicans talk about deficits and their ultra maga agenda," he said.
He wouldn't take a shouted question from your pooler on maga / the Ohio primary results.
A few times he said "mega" and corrected himself, saying he should pronounce it right.
Pool rushed to the South Lawn.
Team USA is gathered, banners, band, the works.
Alongside Biden in Roosevelt room were:
Shalanda Young, Director of the Office of Management and Budget
Cecilia Rouse, Assistant to the President & Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers
Brian Deese, Assistant to the President & Director of the National Economic Council
Potus and flotus walked out to the Olympic Theme at 11:40 am
(No Hail to the Chief this time).
They were cheered by Team USA members.
Flotus is wearing Team USA jacket.
The event, which is being streamed, started with a rousing national anthem.
Flotus speaking first. She said the band has been playing since 8:30 am.
Members of Team USA are gathered on the South Lawn under three banners.
These are athletes from summer and Winter Olympics and Paralympics.
They wore their white jackets. Medalists we're wearing medals.
There were breakfast items in the rose garden - granola and healthy items.
Military jazz combo played Art Blakey, Billy Joel.
VP and first gentleman walked out to Olympic theme at 11:39 accompanied by athletes.
Per the WH:

Potus started speaking at 11:47.
Event was streamed.
Potus displayed some Olympic envy, and referenced his own high school and college sports past.
"I had all those Walter Mitty dreams."
Of flotus, he told athletes: "All she could do was talk about you all. Constantly."
He referenced the COVID delay. "I'm sorry you had to wait that year."
He got a laugh and cheers when he said: "You've been through so damn - darn much."
"Look how you handle victory and defeat," he said admiringly.
Then he got what his presenter called pretty awesome swag.
"Don't jump!" he joked during the swag photo, adding: "She's our photographer."
