 â€” U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, released the following statement in observance of Easter:
"He is risen!
"Heidi and I are in Charleston, South Carolina where we attended a beautiful sunrise service.
"As Christians celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ, we are reminded of the true hope for the world.
"Today I am reminded of the touching anecdote President Reagan once used to explain the prevailing promise of God's word.
"As Reagan said in his famous 'Tear down this wall' speech at the Brandenberg Gate:
"Today is a day to cherish our faith, our freedoms, and all precious gifts that we have been blessed to receive.
"As it is written in Luke 24:7 'The Son of Man must be delivered over to the hands of sinners, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.'
"Heidi and I wish you and your family a very Happy Easter."
