I AM delighted at the bipartisan and overwhelming support that the House gave to the higher education bill yesterday. This brings us closer to the moment when every young man and woman in America can be assured of an education on the basis of his talent rather than on the basis of his ability to pay.
I am also very pleased at the swift action by Senator Morse and his Subcommittee on Higher Education in unanimously reporting the Senate bill this morning. Our colleges by 1970 must be prepared to add 50 percent more enrollment to their presently overcrowded facilities. This bill is a major step toward the meeting of the demands of the next decade.
