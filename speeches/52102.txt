The Administration is pleased that H.R. 1759 provides a multiyear authorization for NASA programs, and other authorizations related to the President's National Space Policy. The Administration supports enactment of H.R. 1759 if amended as indicated below:

H.R. 1759 contains many unnecessary and burdensome requirements concerning reports to Congress or certifications prior to' the execution of programs. These requirements severely restrict the ability of NASA to carry out programs in an effective and expeditious manner, and the Administration urges the deletion of such requirements.
