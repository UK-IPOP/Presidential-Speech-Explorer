Pool Reports by

Good morning.
I’ll be your pooler on this classic D.C. summer day.
Call time isn’t until 2:30 still and the only presidential event on the schedule is a virtual one, but the White House has distributed the below picture and description. Note the date in the description.
Will be back in your inboxes later.
From the White House:
On July 1, President Biden meets with his national security team to discuss the counterterrorism operation to take out Ayman al-Zawahiri. At this meeting, the President was briefed on the proposed operation and shown a model of the safe house where Al-Zawahiri was hiding.
Hello again. The White House passes along the following YouTube link for this afternoon’s POTUS Remarks at the Virtual Event with Governor Whitmer:
Also a note about the photo distributed earlier — in response to an inquiry, the White House said that the photo was taken in the Situation Room at the White House.
The White House says: National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby will be joining Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre in the briefing today.
Just as an FYI for the upcoming virtual event with Gov. Whitmer (link, once more, is 
 ), given that it’s open press and entirely virtual, I don’t plan on sending pool reports about it. If we do get a two-minute warning or the like, I will pass that along.
The briefing began at 3:41 p.m.
I won’t send a follow-up note when it ends, trusting anyone who has that interest will be watching/timing it.
We have a travel photo lid as of 5:14 pm.
Have a good one!
