Good morning on a blustery fall day in DC.
Your pool's call time today isn't until noon, but the White House passes along the following attendees for the President's closed-press virtual summit this morning.
Virtual Attendees at the East Asia Virtual Summit:
Insert your favorite Sinema-Manchin portmanteau here, the White House passes along the following:
From a White House official:
The President hosted Senator Manchin and Senator Sinema at the White House yesterday to continue their negotiations on the Build Back Better Act, and how we can grow our economy in a way that deals the middle class back in and gives them breathing room.
The three made progress on top of what has been accomplished in recent days, and look forward to next steps so that we can equip Americans for high-paying jobs, deliver historic investments to make health care and child care more affordable for American families, and take on climate change.
The briefing with Jen Psaki began at 1:26 pm.
I do not plan to send a "briefing ends" note unless anyone specifically needs it, in an effort to spare your inboxes.
There's a lunch lid until 3:45 pm, per overhead announcement just now.
There have been no schedule updates, for those curious, and there are no public events on the schedule for the President the rest of the day.
For any scrupulous note keepers, the briefing ended at 2:16 pm.
A White House aide confirms that Sen. Sanders was here for a meeting. I don't have specific timing from the press office, but another reporter spotted him leaving recently.
Otherwise, no scheduling or any other updates to share.
The White House announced a travel/photo lid on the overhead at 5:04 pm.
