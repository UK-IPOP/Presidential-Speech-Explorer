Dear Dr. Bevis:
I note with satisfaction the record of accomplishment of your Committee as set forth in its Second Interim Report. It presents a clear picture of the large problems that confront us in building the Nation's potential in science and engineering, and it makes pertinent suggestions for action to help solve these problems.
It is my hope that the organizations whose leaders comprise the Committee, as well as others concerned with these questions, will now use the competent guidance provided by the report and plan and undertake such action as may be appropriate to their aims.
I am grateful to you and the Committee for your devoted service and continuing fruitful efforts.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
