THE 88th Congress has made a distinguished and unparalleled record in the education field. The new laws are new landmarks in our educational progress.
I believe it is imperative to carrying out the intent of Congress for these valuable and constructive measures to be put into operation as promptly and efficiently as possible. The regional meetings scheduled throughout the Nation next month will be an important first step in helping local administrators get started without delay.
I am asking Dr. Keppel to be my personal representative at these sessions and to convey to local school officials and educators my determination that we work together with new earnestness--at all levels--to make our vision equal to our responsibilities in educating America's youth.
