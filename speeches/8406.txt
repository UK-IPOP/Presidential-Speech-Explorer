I WISH to thank Your Excellency for your kind telegram of condolence upon the death of Mr. Francis, whose loss deprives the United States of one of its most devoted public servants and Liberia of a sincere and loyal friend.
HERBERT HOOVER
[His Excellency Charles D.B. King, President of the Republic of Liberia, Monrovia, Liberia]
