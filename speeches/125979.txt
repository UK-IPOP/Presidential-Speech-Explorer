?"?Senate Republicans have pushed through today's energy bill at the expense of the people of Flint, who are still waiting for clean water and critical aid for rebuilding their infrastructure. It is unconscionable for this bill to move forward without this desperately-needed aid. It's important that people be held responsible for the water poisoning in Flintâ€”but it's not enough. I will not stop fighting for the families of Flint until they receive the help all Americans should expect, and the justice all people deserve.?"
