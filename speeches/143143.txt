?Good morning from Palm Beach where it 63 degrees, partly cloudy, and a slight breeze in the air â€“ a beautiful Florida day.

Motorcade departed Mar-a-Lago at 9:22 a.m. for an unannounced location. Pool did not catch a glimpse of POTUS.

Pooler has inquired about details of the president's plans for the day and will pass along any information received or schedule updates.

Pool was COVID tested this morning. 


?POTUS arrived at his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach at 9:32 a.m.

There were a few supporters out along the route, including one holding a sign with a large red heart on it, waving at the motorcade as it rolled by.

Ride was otherwise uneventful.

Pool is holding. 


?POTUS left the Trump International Golf Course at 2:07 pm.

Pool caught a brief glimpse of POTUS in a white shirt sitting in the back passenger side seat of his SUV as the motorcade pulled out of the drive.

We are rolling. 


?POTUS arrived back at Mar-a-Lago at 2:15 pm.

A group of bicyclists who had to stop because of the motorcade waved as it zipped by.

The motorcade also slowed for a large group of supporters waving blue Trump/Pence signs. There were also a few homemade signs including "stop the steal" and "fake news."

We have a travel, photo lid. Enjoy the rest of your Monday.
