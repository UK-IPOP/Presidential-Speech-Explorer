Joe Biden and his supporters like to claim that Biden left President Trump some sort of "
" to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. That's a total fantasy unsupported by the facts.



There's no evidence that any effort was made to replenish the stockpile despite experts calling on the Obama-Biden Administration to do so. This is a serious failure that 
 or accept responsibility for.



Under Vice President Biden, the CDC was overruled and public health officials who insisted testing was still necessary were ignored. As CBS 
: "Some public health officials privately disagreed with the decision to stop testing and counting, telling CBS News that continued tracking of this new and possibly changing virus was important[.]"



The Biden "playbook" was nothing short of a regulatory mess that, 
, President Trump had to completely overhaul to combat the global coronavirus pandemic. Indeed, as Biden's former chief of staff 
, the Obama-Biden Administration did "every possible thing wrong" during the 2009 swine flu. 
" Biden hasn't answered for any of this, nor has the media asked him about it.

 Biden's 
 about how he was sounding the alarm before anyone else. And the record certainly doesn't support his claim that he left a winning "playbook," either.
