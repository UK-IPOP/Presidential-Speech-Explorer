Dear Mr. Secretary:
I am most gratified to learn more of the progress of the Employee-Management Relations Program. Executive Order 10988 on Employee-Management Cooperation in the federal Service is an essential part of our effort to bring new vigor and creativity to the public service.
I appreciate that in any new program such as this one there will be problems of adjustment and transition that must be met. I am confident that they can be resolved satisfactorily and that progress will continue to be achieved in establishing the best possible relationship between the federal Government and its employees.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
