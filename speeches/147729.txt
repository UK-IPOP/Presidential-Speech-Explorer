Good morning from the White House.
In-town pool call time is 8:50.
POTUS and the First Lady are scheduled to arrive in the next hour via Marine One.
The area outside the White House is closed to tourists right now. There are a few white buses carrying families parked outside. The testing center was busier than usual. I am working to get more information about these families.

Marine One landed on the South Lawn at 9:11 a.m. POTUS and FLOTUS exited Marine One at 9:14. He is wearing a black suit and sunglasses. FLOTUS is wearing a black suit and sunglasses.

Travelling with President and the First Lady on Marine One to the White House
Anthony Bernal, Assistant to the President & Advisor to the First Lady
Annie Tomasini, Assistant to the President & Director of Oval Office Operations
Josh Geltzer, Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy Homeland Security Advisor
Stephen Goepfert, Special Assistant to the President & Personal Aide to the President
POTUS spoke to the press for about 5 minutes. More quotes to come.
Q: Do you feel more motivated to act on guns now?
POTUS: "I've been pretty motivated all along. The folks who were victimized, their families, they spent three hours and 40 minutes with me. They waited all that time. Some came two hours early. The pain is palpable. I think a lot of it is unnecessary. I'm going to continue to push."
Q: Is there anything different on how Republicans will approach the gun reform question now?
POTUS: "Since I haven't spoken to them, I don't know."
Q: Are you going to send long-range rocket systems to Ukraine?
A: "We are not going to send to Ukraine rocket systems that can strike into Russia."
Final quotes.
Q: Are you going to send long-range rocket systems to Ukraine?
POTUS: "We are not going to send to Ukraine rocket systems that strike into Russia."
Q: Is there one element, is it age, is it red flag, is there some component that you think could be most successful now?
POTUS:
"That's hard to say because I have not been negotiating with any of the Republicans yet."
"There's only one reason for something that can fire 100 shots."
Talked about hearings he held as a senator about "rational gun laws." Talked about a visit to trauma hospital in New York.
"They showed me an x-ray."
"A 9 mm bullet blows the lung out of the body."
"There's simply no rational basis for it in terms of self protection, hunting."
"The Constitution, the Second Amendment was never absolute. You couldn't buy a cannon when the Second Amendment was passed."
"I think things have gotten so bad that everybody is getting more rational about it."
Q: I know you want Congress to act. Do you believe as president you have a particular responsibility now?
POTUS: "I can't dictate this stuff. I can do the things I've done and any executive action I can take, I'll continue to take. But I can't outlaw a weapon. I can't change a background check. I can't do that."
Q: McConnell directed Sen. Cornyn to search for a compromise. Do you really think there's something there?
POTUS: "I don't know."
"McConnell is a rational Republican. Cornyn is as well."
"I've got to go in, I've got the Gold Star families."
The White House corrects Annie Tomasini's title. It should be: Assistant to the President
