IT IS FITTING that these majestic peaks be named in Sir Winston Churchill's honor. Soldier, author, statesman, he was one of the greatest leaders in the history of English-speaking peoples, and he devoted his life to the twin goals of peace and freedom. Sir Winston was an honorary American citizen--the second man in history to be so honored by the people of the United States.
