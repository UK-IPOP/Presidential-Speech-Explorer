Pool Reports by 
, 
Good morning from the White House on a hot and sunny Tuesday. I will be your print pooler today.
Members of the restricted in-house pool are being tested for the novel coronavirus in lower press. Your pooler has received her test and is told that no news is good news.
The president currently has no public events on his schedule. I will keep you posted if that changes. Feel free to reach out with questions.
The White House has called a lunch lid until 2 p.m.
The White House called a travel/photo lid at 5:10 p.m. Have a wonderful evening, everyone.
