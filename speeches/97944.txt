 Few issues have been more hotly debated or had a more lasting impact on our country's course. Of President Bush's judicial nominees, the Senate has confirmed 
 Circuit Court judges and 
 District Court judges (as of October 6, 2008). Today more than one-third of all Federal judges have been appointed by him â€“ and these men and women are jurists of the highest caliber with an abiding belief in the sanctity of our Constitution.
 It is the only branch of government whose officers are unelected. That means the judges appointed to the Federal bench should exercise their power prudently, cautiously, and conservatively. Judges can have a profound impact on the daily lives of every citizen.
 America is particularly well served by President Bush's appointments to the Supreme Court.
