Dear Mr.____________:
Attached is a draft of legislation which would extend certain benefits to persons who shall have served in the Armed Forces on or after June 27, 1950.
I believe the desirability of such legislation will be readily apparent to the Congress. Unless and until such legislation is enacted, certain individuals already separated from the military service, and whose needs are acute, will be denied medical and hospital care.
In view of this situation, I hope the Congress will take favorable action on this legislation at the earliest possible date.

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
