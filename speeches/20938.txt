Dear Prime Minister:
Thank you for your two letters of October tenth, and particularly for your renewed invitation to visit New Zealand as the guest of your Government. Such a visit would, I can assure you, be a source of happiness to Mrs. Eisenhower and me, for we have often wished to see your beautiful country and to get better acquainted with the people of New Zealand. Since we have made no plans for the period after I leave office, I can unfortunately make no commitment in this regard, but I most sincerely appreciate your kindness in renewing this gracious invitation.
With warm personal regard,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
