Pool Reports by

Happy Presidents Day on a dreary Monday at the White House. Pool has been tested ahead of POTUS' return to DC following a weekend at Camp David.
He's currently scheduled to arrive just after 3:00pm ET but has no other public events on the schedule. I'll let y'all know about any updates as soon as they're received and, as always, feel free to reach out directly with any questions.
WH made a bad weather call on POTUS' return to DC, so he'll be motorcading back from Joint Base Andrews and won't be visible to the press until tomorrow.
We had an official lid call at 1:36pm. Enjoy the rest of your Monday!
