President Donald Trump's visit to Doral today is a good opportunity to contrast his achievements for Hispanic Americans with Joe Biden's record of betraying our communities.

While President Trump 
 record-breaking prosperity for Hispanic Americans and strongly 
 that America will never be a socialist or communist country,


Let's be clear: Biden's appeasement Castrochavistas like Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez, and Bass is an insult to millions of Hispanics and it should disqualify him from the presidency. The only reason why Biden gets a pass is because 
in the Fake News Media use their platforms to 
 and hide the Democrat Party's extremism from the American people.

It is a sham that is no longer working. Hispanics know better, which is why Joe Biden and his culturally incompetent campaign are 
 with our communities while President Trump grows his diverse coalition.
