CONGRATULATIONS on the magnificent beginning of the Apollo 8 adventure. The visions of the past are coming closer and closer to becoming the amazing achievements of the present.
I am confident that the world's finest equipment will strive to match the courage of our astronauts. If it does that, a successful mission is assured. Prudence is a of courage, however, so we must give priority to astronaut safety as decisions are made each step of the way.
