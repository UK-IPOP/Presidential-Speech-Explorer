THIS HAPPENS to be the number one whistlestop of 1952.
There are going to be a lot more of them. You have the privilege of being number one.
I hope you will be able to hear the rebroadcast of my power program speech tomorrow at Bull Shoals Dam. And that is a good name, you know--Bull Shoals. It will set out the policy of the Government of the United States towards public power, and it will be a part of the Democratic platform of 1952.
I am exceedingly sorry that I won't be able to make the same sort of back platform speeches as I did in 1948. I will be working for somebody else in 1952.
But I am happy indeed to have your wonderful Governor here with me this afternoon, and your Congressman, and the Secretary of the Army, frank Pace, and my Congressman of North Arkansas--who really is a Congressman from Missouri. It is a pleasure indeed, and I am going to enjoy every minute of this trip, because I like this part of the country. I have been in every county in this part of the State of Arkansas, and every county in southern Missouri. And I used to know everybody in Missouri by his first name when I was running for the Senate, but it has grown up on me. It has been 16 years since I have done that.
I have another great citizen of Arkansas here, the Secretary of the Treasury, John W. Snyder. I have got the Secretary of the Senate with me--I call him the third Senator from Arkansas--Leslie Biffle.
