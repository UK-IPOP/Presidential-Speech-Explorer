EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY is a fundamental American ideal, and it applies with especial force in the field of labor. Denial of this right on the grounds of race, color or creed is abhorrent to all thinking men and women. During this particular period the Negro suffers, as do many of his fellow Americans, from worldwide economic depression and unemployment. In the vast reconstruction projects which the administration has inaugurated for the relief of unemployment, it is the wish of the administration that employment shall be given to the Negro worker on the same basis as it is given to every other American.
The administration's policy has recently been affirmed in a special memorandum to all contractors engaged on Government projects in the following language:
"The Treasury Department has from time to time announced its policy in the construction of public buildings and public works under its control that in the employment of mechanics and labor, preference be given to local labor to such extent as it is available and competent, and that there be no discrimination exercised against any person because of color or religious affiliation.
"You are directed to bring the above stated policy to the attention of all contractors and subcontractors and their representatives whose work comes under your superintendence, coupled with the request that they cooperate with the Department in carrying such policy into effect, and you will notify the Department promptly of any departure from or disregard of such policy by any such contractor, subcontractor, or representative thereof."
