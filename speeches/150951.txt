Hello,
I will be your print pooler today. The supplemental travel pool has been swept and is awaiting POTUS in a holding area at Fort McHenry.
I spotted Maryland Gov. Wes Moore speaking with former NOLA Mayor and current WH Senior Advisor and Infrastructure Coordinator Mitch Landrieu near the pool holding area.
This is on the schedule for today per the WH advisory.
M1 landed at 1:37 on a patch of grass at Fort McHenry.
POTUS emerged from M1 at 1:40 and at spoke briefly with Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott and MD Gov. Wes Moore. At 1:41, they all entered the same car in the motorcade, which began rolling at 1:42 en route to the Baltimore and Potomac Tunnel North Portal.
From the WH:
Greeting the President at Fort McHenry Landing Zone, Baltimore, Maryland:

The motorcade arrived at the location at 1:58.
Your pooler did not spot POTUS exit his vehicle.
Press has peeled off from POTUS and is in a the outdoor press holding area.
POTUS' remarks will be livestreamed on YouTube.
The ride to the location was uneventful.
Dozens of onlookers and about 2 dogs near Fort McHenry stood on the sidewalks holding their iPhones recording the motorcade as it drove by. Two people stood with an American flag and an "I stand with Ukraine" flag. Near the event location, a member of the pool spotted a woman stick her head out the window to look at the motorcade near the event.

Hello from sunny Washington. I'm your in-town pooler today.
The White House says POTUS is running a few minutes ahead of schedule for his arrival back at the White House this afternoon. He was scheduled to arrive at 4:05 pm. I'll send a new time when we have it.
We are gathering now for President Biden's arrival at the White House.
President Biden, donning his aviators, arrived on the South Lawn at 3:57 pm. He walked toward a crowd of who your pooler thinks are staffers and shook hands for about five minutes.
He then walked over to the press and took several questions. Your pooler had a hard time hearing so thanks to several reporters who helped piece this together. These are not direct quotes. I'll try to send cleaner quotes when I have them.
Q: Will the US provide F-16s to Ukraine?
A: No.
Someone asked about the conversation with the Dutch PM today and Biden said the conversation was private.
Q: What are you going to discuss with McCarthy?
A: (not direct quote) - show me your budget and I'll show you mine.
Q: Have your views on community policing changed?
A: No ... We need community policing ... we need to have a relationship with the community .. have psychologists and psychiatrists.
Biden was also asked if he will visit Europe for the one-year anniversary of the Ukraine war and he said "I'm not sure."
In response to a separate question, Biden said he was planning to visit Poland but didn't yet know when.
Q: Would you be willing to meet with the CBC on police reform?
A: Yes
He also said he still wants the George Floyd Act passed.
The White House called a lid at 4:26 pm.
Have a great night, everyone!
