I WAS SADDENED to learn of the death of President Rene Schick. Please accept Mrs. Johnson's and my deepest personal sympathy in this sorrowful moment.
We recall the happy time we had when he visited us two months ago. The Hemisphere will miss him.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Mrs. Carmen Renasco de Schick, Casa Presidential, Managua, Nicaragua]
