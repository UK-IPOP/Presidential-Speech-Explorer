My dear Mrs. Van Valkenburg:
I am profoundly grieved to learn of the death of my dear friend, your husband, and both Mrs. Hoover and I wish you to know of our deep sympathy with you in your bereavement. The country has lost in him a citizen of distinguished patriotism, high mindedness, and zeal, and all of us who knew him well have lost an unselfish and most valued friend.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mrs. Edwin A. Van Valkenburg, Green Hill Road, Overbrook, Pa.]
