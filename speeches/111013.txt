"After failing to meet with his jobs council for more than six months, President Obama is now ducking questions about this morning's abysmal GDP report. Americans deserve to know what it will take for President Obama to seriously address the issue of jobs and the economy. It has been nearly four years, and we are still waiting for an answer." â€” Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman
 "Pres Obama declined several invitations from reporters to comment on today's lackluster GDP report - up just 1.5% in the 2nd Quarter." (Mark Knoller,

 "U.S. economic growth slowed as expected in the second quarter as consumers spent at their slowest pace in a year, potentially pushing the Federal Reserve closer to pumping more money into the economy. Gross domestic product expanded at a 1.5 percent annual rate between April and June, the weakest pace of growth since the third quarter of 2011, the Commerce Department said on Friday."

 "A U.S. economy that plodded along in the first three months of the year likely grew even less in the April-June quarter. And most economists no longer think growth will strengthen much in the second half of 2012.
