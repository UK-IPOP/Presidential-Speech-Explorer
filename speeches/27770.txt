TODAY'S action by the Senate in disapproving funds for continued development of the supersonic transport prototypes is both distressing and disappointing. It represents a severe blow not only to the tens of thousands of workers affected, and to their families, but also to the United States continued leadership position in the aerospace industry. More deeply, it could be taken as a reversal of America's tradition of staying in the vanguard of scientific and technological advance.
I am determined that this vote on the SST will not be a shift in basic direction. It is a setback, but we will remain on a continuing course of exploration and development in those areas in which America traditionally has taken the leading role, and from which so much has flowed to the benefit of mankind.
It has always been America's pride, and the source of much of our strength, that we have constantly reached out toward new horizons in the search for knowledge--not from a chauvinistic desire to be number one, but from the conviction that we must continue to develop the countless new benefits that flow from exploration of the unknown. Development of the SST has been a part of that proud, creative, and deeply humanistic tradition. Though the Congress has declined to continue helping fund this development, I shall strive to ensure that the tradition is maintained.
