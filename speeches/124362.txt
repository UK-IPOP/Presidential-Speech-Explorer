Over the course of my time in the Senate, I have had the opportunity to work with Senator Marco Rubio on national security. We have had that opportunity to discuss the threats to America.
He does understand those threats very well. I know he has the confidence necessary in a leader to contain or destroy ISIS. I watched him fight that fight. Beyond our national security, he is a father just as I am a mother. And I know that he wants to work hard to make sure that that American Dream is alive for our children.
