IN HIS tragedy, "Murder in the Cathedral," T. S. Eliot wrote, "Clear the air! Clean the sky! Wash the wind!"
I have proposed to the Congress a sweeping and comprehensive program to do just that, and more--to end the plunder of America's natural heritage.
A nation's history is written in the book of its words, the book of its deeds, the book of its art. A people's history is also written in what they do with the natural beauty providence bestowed upon them.
With your support, and with the help of the Congress, we can reclaim and preserve the natural beauty of America unto all the generations that come after us.
