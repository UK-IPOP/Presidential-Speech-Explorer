 Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced the campaign's first group of Florida County Chairs. These 59 individuals will lead the campaign's efforts in nearly half of Florida's 67 counties. They will build and expand Governor Romney's grassroots infrastructure across the state, helping to share his vision for America's future with more Floridians.
"We have a strong and growing organization in the Sunshine State, and I am honored to have the support and commitment of these Floridians," said Governor Romney. "This group of dedicated individuals will spearhead our local efforts to reach out to Florida voters as I continue to aggressively campaign in this important state."
These county leaders join a Florida organization that includes an accomplished Florida Steering Committee and a Florida Statewide Finance Team comprised of more than 80 business and community leaders from across the state. The Florida Steering Committee is led by former Lieutenant Governor Toni Jennings and chaired by former Speaker of the House Allan Bense, Agriculture and Consumer Services Commissioner Charles Bronson, former Chairman of the Florida Republican Party Al Cardenas, U.S. Congressman Tom Feeney and former Speaker of the House John Thrasher.
"As Governor Romney campaigns in Florida and across the nation, voters are learning why he is the best choice to lead our nation and the only candidate that can bring strong, new leadership to Washington," said former Lt. Governor Toni Jennings. "With our primary now moved up to January, this impressive team of county leaders will recruit new supporters and volunteers to help secure victory for Governor Romney in Florida."
Governor Romney's Florida Steering Committee is also co-chaired by St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Baker, State Representative Jennifer Carroll, former State Representative Dudley Goodlette, David Griffin, State Representative Anitere Flores, former Secretary of State Glenda Hood and former Republican Party of Florida Chairman Van Poole. Additionally, Congresswoman Ginny Brown-Waite serves as a member of Governor Romney's Congressional Whip Team.
