Dear Sir:

I have your letter of August 9th.
The question you raise is hardly appropriate for the governors' conference which is dealing with a special subject. Every decent citizen must condemn the lynching evil as an undermining of the very essence of justice and democracy.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Sam H. Reading, 24 N. 59th Street, Philadelphia, Pa.]
