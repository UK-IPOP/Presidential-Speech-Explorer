[Released July 11, 1932. Dated July 9, 1932]
I HAVE LEARNED with deep concern of the distressing accident which has involved the officers and men of the submarine Promethee, and desire to assure Your Excellency of the sympathetic anxiety which the American people and I share with France on this sad occasion.
