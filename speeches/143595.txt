Good morning all! A lid has been called until 2:30pm.
At roughly 2:30pm, pool left the hotel, and we are now waiting near Biden's home. I will send more updates as I receive them.
It's 4:01, and the motorcade has left Biden's house. We're in the motorcade moving to an undisclosed location.
Biden entered the church (the press was located far away). He is attending mass at St. Edmond Catholic Church.
POTUS left church at 4:49 and walked over to a group of women, wearing the Irish flag and selling raffle tickets, and he gave them cash. Watchers cheered nearby, and he waved. He did not respond to a shouted questions about Afghanistan and France. It's 4:51, and we are back in the motorcade and rolling.
Lid was called at 5:02.
