It's been over a month since 
 in 
 and voters 
 don't know the outcome of two races. While 
 for those unable to vote in person, 
andthe liberal media continues to lie about it.

Examples across the country prove that 
. In Pennsylvania, 
 
. In New Jersey's vote-by-mail election, 
In California's primary, 
 for a variety of reasons, including postmarking issues and signature mismatches. Some residents in Patterson, NJ, 
 but were listed as having voted. In Georgia, a dead cat 
.

As the Trump campaign's latest video illustrates, the risks of universal mail-in voting go on and on, but the national liberal media refuses to talk about it.
