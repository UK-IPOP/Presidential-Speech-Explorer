Memorandum to Department and Agency Heads:
The federal Council for Science and Technology has transmitted to me a report entitled "The Competition for Quality" which sets forth steps urgently needed to assure competence within the Government establishment to carry out its program of scientific research and development. With the increasing importance of science and technology in developing our military defenses, in achieving our foreign policy objectives, and in sustaining the health and welfare of every citizen, the federal Government must attract and retain its share of talented scientists and engineers at all levels.
The proposals I submitted to the Congress for pay reform which embody the principles of comparability with salaries in the private sector and internal adjustment to permit rewards for competence meet the recommendations contained in Part I of the report.
In Part II the Council suggests additional steps that should be taken to develop a more favorable environment for science within the Government. These are largely administrative in character. I am attaching this portion of the report. All practicable action should be taken to implement these recommendations. The Special Assistant to the President for Science and Technology will report to me from time to time as to the measures which have been taken.
JOHN F. KENNEDY
