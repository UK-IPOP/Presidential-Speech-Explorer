General Warren, General Sweeney, Secretary Zuckert, Mr. Vice President, General LeMay, Deputy Secretary Gilpatric, ladies and gentlemen:
I know that all of you are connected with this base, that you are either the children or the wives of the people who work here-fliers and those who help man these planes. I would like to express my very great thanks on behalf of all of us to all of you.
I don't think anyone could have watched the flying that we have seen today and the commitment to this country demonstrated by those who manned these airplanes, and serviced them, without going back home a good deal happier.
We want to thank you all. I hope that all Americans realize what you're doing.

Thank you.
