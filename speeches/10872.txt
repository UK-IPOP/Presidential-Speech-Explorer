MR. ALLEN T. BURNS, the Executive Director of the Association of Community Chests and Councils, has advised the President that their organizations in 227 cities which have so far been heard from report their complete confidence that they, in cooperation with municipalities and other local agencies, will be able wholly to undertake the unemployment relief situation during the forthcoming winter. The plans in these cities are going forward actively, and more cities are being heard from daily.
