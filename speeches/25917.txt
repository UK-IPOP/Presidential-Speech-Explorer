Your Excellency, Mrs. Hoveyda, Secretary Rusk and Mrs. Rusk, distinguished guests:
We are honored by your arrival and I look forward to my discussions with you, Mr. Prime Minister, and Mrs. Johnson and I are delighted to welcome you and Mrs. Hoveyda to our home.
I am always eager to hear more of Iran's progress. Our visit to Tehran in 1962 convinced me of Iran's great potential. My friend, His Imperial Majesty, has told me much of what Iran has achieved since then. Today we shall learn more from the Prime Minister, who has contributed much by his own energy, competence, and dedication.
A nation's progress--as you know so well, Mr. Prime Minister--hinges on the ability to marshal its energies and its resources for the good of all of its people.

We in the United States have a great tradition of relying on the initiative of the individual. Yet we have learned that government-speaking faithfully for the people of a nation--can multiply the opportunities for individual success.
Together, government and the people--in a partnership for progress--can do things that neither could do alone.
Your government has learned this too, Mr. Prime Minister. And the leaders of Iran deserve praise for their wisdom in attracting individual citizens to the cause of a great nation. How they are doing this is one of the truly exciting stories of our time. Imagine these scenes:

--Several thousand Literacy Corpsmen leave their training centers and go by train, and then by bus and then perhaps by horse into distant villages in order to teach.
--A shepherd boy learns to read and write and to help his parents, who cannot read, in ways an older generation never dreamed possible. That boy's father now owns the land that he tills.

--New agricultural extension agents visit distant villages. Educated young people help in applying new scientific methods to farming and to husbandry.

--Almost 2,000 Health Corpsmen ride the circuit from one village to another, bringing medical care to people who have never known it.

--Members of Iran's Development Corps work on those small but critical projects that contribute to the health and the well-being of rural Iran.

--Imagine, too, councils of justice meeting in the towns and villages, helping to create bonds between the governed and those who govern.

--New industries are rising over the length and breadth of this ancient land, built with Iranian investment and run by Iranian managers and Iranian technicians and skilled Iranian workers.

--And, finally, picture a Prime Minister who has traveled throughout his country to stimulate progress and to cut red tape. His improvements in public administration have helped create a new confidence in the conduct of the people's business.
Mr. Prime Minister, we Americans take heart from what is happening in Iran. We know that success lies ahead for the nation where government and people are willing to work side by side.
Mr. Prime Minister, we are so glad to bid you a hearty welcome.
