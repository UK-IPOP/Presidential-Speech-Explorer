Rubio denounced the rhetoric on the campaign trail. Without naming Trump he said that we have a candidate that says at rallies "if someone heckles me and you punch them in face I will pay your legal fees. .... We have a candidate that uses profanity. We have never had a presidential candidate that has to be bleeped out. We have a candidate now leading the Republican primary that we have to explain to our children."

In a hit on Trump, Rubio said "The presidency is not a reality TV show. It's not the political version of Survivor."
