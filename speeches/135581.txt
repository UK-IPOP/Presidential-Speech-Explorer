Mr. President, are you losing Republican support? Are you losing Republican support, Mr. President?

 No, we have great Republican support, as you know.

Can you keep Republicans behind you in this fight?

 We have great Republican support, as you know. You know, you're just making that up. But we have tremendous Republican support. I don't think the Democrats have great support, because they all know we need border security. We need to have people stop being killed at our border. And the Democrats are losing a lot of support.

Last night was a big victory for Republicans, but it was really a big victory for America, for our country. The Democrats have lost support. There is tremendous Republican support—unwavering—as you probably know. Thank you.

What's your message to Republicans?

 Listen, we need border security. Very simple.

How long do plan to let the shutdown last, Mr. President?

 Well, what you should do is take a look at last night and see the results this morning. The people know we need border security. Thank you very much.

 Are you worried about Republican defections?
