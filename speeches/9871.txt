Following a conference tonight with Secretary Wallace, George Peek and General Johnson, the President authorized the statement that, for the purpose of coordination, all codes under the N.I.R.A. including those under negotiation by the A.A.A. will be turned over to the Administrator of the N.R.A.
The only exception to this is codes pertaining to the manufacturers engaged in the first processing of agricultural products and handlers previous to the first processing. This work will be continued under the A.A.A.
