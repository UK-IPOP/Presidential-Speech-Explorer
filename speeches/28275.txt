Gentlemen:
In a very few minutes the Vice President will be departing on a 30,000-mile trip which will take him to Vietnam, Thailand, the Republic of China, and Korea. On this trip he will be meeting with the heads of state of each of those countries. He will be having very substantive conversations and he will be taking from me personal messages, but substantive messages, on our bilateral relations with each nation.
The Vice President, as you will recall, took a trip to this part of the world just 8 months ago, a very successful trip in terms of reassuring our allies of our basic commitments in that area of the world and informing them of the purpose of the Nixon Doctrine--a doctrine which has as its goal not withdrawing from Asia, but providing the means whereby the United States will help other nations help themselves so that we can have a peaceful pacific with free nations in Asia able to defend themselves against aggression.
The Vice President will be returning on August 31 or September 1, possibly September 1, and will be reporting here at the Western White House before returning to Washington.
Perhaps you would like to say a word, Mr. Vice President.
