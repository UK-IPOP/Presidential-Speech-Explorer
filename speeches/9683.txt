I AM DEEPLY grieved to learn of the death and destruction visited upon the people of Puerto Rico
 and their possessions, and wish you please to report to me at once the salient facts of the situation especially those looking to immediate provision of any relief that can be supplied by our public agencies.
HERBERT HOOVER
[Honorable James R. Beverley, Governor, San Juan, Puerto Rico]
 On May 17, 1932, the President signed Pub. Res. No. 20, (47 Stat. 158) designating "Puerto" as the official spelling.
