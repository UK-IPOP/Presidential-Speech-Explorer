How are you feeling about tomorrow, sir?
 Well, I'm feelingâ€”I'm optimistic. But I'm always optimistic.
Can Democrats win the House?
 I think it's going to be tough, but I think we can. I think we'll win the Senate, and I think the House is tougher.
What do you think awaits you if it is a Republican-controlled Congress?
 What do I think what?
Awaits you. What's your new reality going to be like in Washington?
 More difficult.
 Will it be difficult to the rest of the world, though, where they're worried about Ukraine?
