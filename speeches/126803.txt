Hey guys,
I'm a Texas native living in Tulsa while I finish a bachelor's in journalism â€” due to an administrative oversight at my local elections office my absentee ballot didn't make it into my mailbox until this past weekend. I paid $65 today to overnight it to Texas because I believe in Marco.
Thanks for all your hard work! Best of luck tomorrow! #marcomomentum
