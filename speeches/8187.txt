To the Congress of the United States:
I commend to the favorable consideration of the Congress the inclosed report from the Acting Secretary of State, to the end that legislation may be enacted to authorize an appropriation of $45,000 to defray half the expenses of an investigation to be made jointly by the United States and Canada of the probable effects of the damming of Passamaquoddy and Cobscook Bays on the fisheries of that region.
