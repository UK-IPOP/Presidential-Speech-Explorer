G-20 Leaders today agreed to implement a comprehensive set of policies that will help reinvigorate global economic recovery. Under the "Cannes Action Plan for Jobs and Growth," G-20 Leaders agreed that "strengthened international policy cooperation is needed now" and that their "ultimate objective is to provide more and better jobs for our citizens."

Since the Seoul Summit in November 2010, financial stress has increased sharply and the pace of economic growth has slowed, most notably in the advanced economies. The most serious risk to the global recovery is the financial crisis in Europe. However, events in Europe are not the only risk; progress to rebalance global demand has stalled. In this regard, emerging markets must do more to bolster domestic demand and help sustain global growth.

With the Cannes Action Plan for Growth and Jobs, G-20 members agreed to implement "measures to secure the recovery" including:


In addition to the emphasis on job creation and growth in the near-term, Leaders agreed to an action plan to strengthen the medium-term foundations for growth consisting of: sustainable public finances, open trade and investment markets, structural reforms to boost growth and enhance job creation, increased saving by countries with current account deficits and increased private demand by countries with current account surpluses, reforms to national and global financial systems, and actions to promote development.

Specific commitments include:


The commitments made today to pursue stronger and more balanced global growth, flexible exchange rates, financial and structural reforms, and sustainable public finances will lead to a stronger and more sustainable growth path globally and in the United States, and to the good jobs that our citizens need.
