My dear Mrs. Bird:
I am deeply grieved to learn of the death of your brother, the universally beloved Father Francis P. Duffy. I had the pleasure of his acquaintance and I shared the admiration he inspired in all who knew him by his joyous humanity and his unlimited interest in and devotion to the happiness and well-being of others. He will be sorely missed.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER

[Mrs. Michael Bird, Holy Cross Rectory, West 42nd Street, New York, N.Y.]
