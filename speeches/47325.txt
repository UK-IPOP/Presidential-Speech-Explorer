The Administration opposes H.R. 4090, because:


— there is no evidence that the additional land is threatened with imminent development requiring Federal acquisition;

— existing mechanisms and administrative solutions are adequate to protect the watershed of the area; and

— enactment could impede completion of Interstate 75 in a cost-effective and expeditious manner.
In short, there is no compelling reason to spend over $40 million to expand the Federal estate in southern Florida, when the Federal Government already owns about 2 million acres nearby and about 4.2 million acres in the State.
