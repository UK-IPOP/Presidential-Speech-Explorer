Dear General Gursel:
It is a great pleasure for me to send greetings to you and to the Turkish people on the occasion of the opening of the Turkish Constituent Assembly.
This historic event is a further tangible demonstration of Tarkish dedication to democratic ideals and of its determination to build a solid foundation for the future.
Please extend my best wishes to the members of this Assembly for the success of the important work on which they are embarking.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
