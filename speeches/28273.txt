PRESIDENT Diaz Ordaz has very well summarized the results of our discussions. I only want to add my congratulations and express appreciation to the Secretary for Foreign Affairs, the Secretary of State, and their staffs for working out some of these, what seemed to be difficult, problems: and also to pay my respects and again express my appreciation to the President for the leadership that he has displayed in attempting to work out satisfactorily, not only the disputes of the past which have sometimes plagued the relations unnecessarily between our two countries for 100 years, but a formula for settling any dispute that may come out in the future.
It is necessary, under the Mexican Constitution, that this agreement be submitted to the Congress. I, of course, cannot speak for the Congress of Mexico. I understand that the possibility of its being approved, I believe, is very good.
As far as we are concerned, we will submit this as a treaty to the United States Senate. While we have had some difficulties with some votes in the Senate, the Secretary of State assures me that we can get a unanimous vote on this treaty.
During the course of our meeting of over two hours and a half, the President and I had an opportunity also to discuss a wide range of bilateral matters between our two countries. And one of those subjects, I think, should be mentioned: the Colorado River salinity problem.
I noted, incidentally, there was a group at the airport expressing a great interest in this problem. We, of course, are vitally concerned about it. And I can report, with the President's approval, that we made progress in our discussions and are continuing at the working level trying to find a solution that we believe will be satisfactory.
