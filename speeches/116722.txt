Today, National Security Adviser Susan E. Rice announced that Suzy George will be named Deputy Assistant to the President, Executive Secretary of the National Security Council and Chief of Staff of the National Security Council staff. Ms. George will succeed Brian McKeon, who will soon depart the White House to become the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy at the Department of Defense.

Ambassador Rice said, "Suzy George brings a wealth of foreign policy, government and management experience to this position, through her long service at the Department of State and as a principal with the Albright Stonebridge Group. Her service at the highest levels of the State Department, where she engaged with senior leaders across the U.S. government and with foreign partners, gives me great confidence in her ability to lead the National Security Council staff."

Ms. George has served as a principal at the Albright Stonebridge Group LLC, an international strategic consulting firm, and previously with The Albright Group LLC, since 2001. From 1997-2001, Ms. George served as the Deputy Chief of Staff in the Department of State, overseeing the management and coordination of travel and meetings, as a liaison to the White House and other Cabinet departments, and working across the Department on a range of foreign policy initiatives for Secretary Madeleine Albright.

Ms. George has a BA from Mount Holyoke College, and a JD from the George Washington University Law School.
