Hello from JBA. I'll be your print pooler for the president and first lady's trip to North Carolina for a Friendsgiving event with service members and military families.
Marine One landed here at 4:23 p.m., and the president and first lady stepped off a few moments later. They went to board Air Force One without stopping to talk with reporters. FLOTUS waved as she boarded, and POTUS turned and waved at the top step.

We are rolling for takeoff at 4:30 p.m.

The president and First Lady then made their way on foot a short distance into the hangar where the event is taking place. Pool walked to a different entrance, and we are now holding inside.
There are dozens of round tables set up with eight chairs placed around each table. Many attendees are dressed in military fatigues. There are buffet stations set up on either side of the hangar. On one side of the hangar are military vehicles, and on the other is a sign that says "Happy Thanksgiving"

As we waited for POTUS and FLOTUS to take the stage, one speaker promised this would be the best meal that service members ate during their time in the Marine Corps. Several attendees here came up to take photos with press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, too.
Here's the speaking lineup, and a reminder that you can watch live here: 
The President and the First Lady will deliver brief comments at a Friendsgiving dinner at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina.
The First Lady
Jennifer Gonzalez
The President
Commander Wesley Myhand, Chaplain of the Marine Air Corps Station, Cherry Point, North Carolina
President Biden gave brief remarks, walking among the tables with a handheld mic as he spoke.
"The reason we came is the chef's not bad," he joked.
He praised the sacrifice of those serving in the military, calling them the "greatest fighting force in the history of the world." He also thanked their spouses, saying they put up with "an awful lot." He also thanked Gov. Roy Cooper, who is in attendance.
The president said he'll be serving mashed potatoes in the buffet line. Pool is holding toward the back of the room as the president and First Lady assist with one of the buffet lines on the other side of the room. The smell of turkey and other thanksgiving fare is filling the air of this enclosed space as guests are dismissed by table to get food.
From the White House:
The President and the First Lady participate in a Friendsgiving dinner with service members and military families from Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, Camp Lejeune, and Marine Corps Air Station, New River in North Carolina as part of the First Lady's Joining Forces Initiative.

After about 40 minutes at a serving station, the Bidens began going table to table to meet and greet the service members and military families in attendance. Pool remained in our holding area throughout that time (photographers were allowed to follow the president). The First Lady came to a table right near the pool for a few minutes at one point, though the conversation was inaudible as there was music playing in the background.
The president mingled at tables a bit further away from the pool as the two took a divide and conquer approach to cover the whole room.
Also, for those wondering, Robert Irvine is the chef who hosted tonight's meal.
