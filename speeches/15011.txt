WELL, I appreciate that most highly. I don't know of any other place I would rather receive it from than from Independence High School--William Chrisman High School it is now--from which I graduated in 1901, a long time ago.
I shall treasure this and put it with my mementoes. If ever I get in a contest on oratory, I shall wear it.
I hope you are successful in your continuation of your contest, and that I may have the privilege of shaking hands with one of you as a national winner.
I hope, when you go back to my hometown, you will remember me to my friends out there, and I shall always consider Independence and Jackson County my home. And sometime after the 20th of January next, I expect to be back.
