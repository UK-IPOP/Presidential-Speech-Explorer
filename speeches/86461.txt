 This task force will marshal the resources of the Federal government to crack down on the criminals who traffic in stolen identities and protect American families from this devastating crime.
 This task force, chaired by the Attorney General and the FTC Chair, strengthens our efforts to protect the financial information of our citizens.
 The Task Force will help law enforcement officials investigate and prosecute identity thieves, it will help educate consumers and businesses on ways they can protect themselves, and it will increase the safeguards on personal data held by the Federal government.
 Among other provisions, the FACT Act:
 This act created a new crime of "aggravated identity theft" and added two years to prison sentences for criminals convicted of using stolen credit card numbers and other personal data to commit crimes.
 Citizens work hard to build their credit histories and rely on their credit to help their families build better lives. Since 2003, surveys have estimated the number of U.S. adults who became victims of identity theft within the preceding year at around 10 million, and the annual losses due to identity theft amount to $50 billion.
 The U.S. Social Security Administration will involve its field offices. Other partners include the National Association of Realtors, the American College Personnel Association-College Student Educators International, the National Association of Student Personnel Administrators, the National Crime Prevention Council, the National Apartment Association, and America's Community Bankers.
