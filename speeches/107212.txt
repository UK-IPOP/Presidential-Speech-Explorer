Mitt Romney today announced the County Chairs and Co-Chairs for his Florida campaign.
"In order to win in January, and defeat President Obama in November, my campaign will need the hard work of these Florida County Chairs," said Mitt Romney. "Their work on the ground, reaching out to voters will be important as I campaign to spread my pro-growth message and bring jobs back to Florida."
"This impressive group only adds to Mitt Romney's strong team in Florida," said Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam. "Defeating President Obama will not be easy, but with the hard work of our team in Florida and Mitt Romney's conservative record of leadership and results, we will be successful in November."
