 Mr. President, are you going to tell the Romanian President when Romania will be taken into NATO? [
]
 It's not a press conference. [
]
 She's been doing this quite a long while. She's better at it than we are, and we cannot win. [
]
 What do you think of your reception, Mr. President?
 It was wonderful seeing all the people in the streets, and I'm very, very glad to be here. It's quite impressive what they have accomplished here in Romania in such a short time. And I think you see from the spirit of the people in the streets their devotion to freedom. It's a great tribute to the President and to his Government, and I'm looking forward to this.
 What do you hear from Mars? [
]
 We're doing okay on Mars.
 Mr. President, is the situation in Bosnia calm? I mean, have you heard any reports?
 So far, yes. We have no reports to the contrary.
 Are you sorry they didn't get the big guys?
 Well, I think what was done was appropriate and within the SFOR mandate. The people were under sealed indictment, and they came in regular contact with the SFOR forces there—and that's plainly within the mandate—in the British sector. They were prepared to do that, and we helped them to move the people who were arrested to the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague. And I think it was the right thing to do.
