DURING his visit to South Viet-Nam several days ago, Secretary McNamara informed me that certain technical restrictions were preventing our paratroopers from earning incentive pay.
The rules were that a paratrooper had to perform one or more jumps from an airplane during any 3 consecutive months to qualify for incentive pay for that period. In many instances, however, while paratroopers were engaged in ground actions, they were thus unable to make the jumps, and, as a result, lost their eligibility for incentive pay.
This was the situation that called for prompt corrective action. I have today taken that action by approving an amendment to Executive Order 11157. Under the change, a paratrooper can now earn incentive pay if his commanding officer waives the jump requirements when a paratrooper is unable to meet them because he is engaged in operations in a hostile-fire area.
