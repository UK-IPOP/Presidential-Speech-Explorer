Can you feel the momentum? Saturday is the South Carolina primary—and we're working hard to earn a big win that will put Hillary Clinton one step closer to the nomination.
That means doing everything we can between now and then to get supporters to the polls.
This campaign is all about making a real difference in people's lives—that's why we're out there fighting alongside Hillary every single day. But first things first: we've got to lock down this nomination. And every voter we contact between now and Saturday will make a big difference.
So what are you waiting for? Let's get out there and win this thing!
