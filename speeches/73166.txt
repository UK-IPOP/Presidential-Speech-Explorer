The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 1654. The authorization levels in the bill do not conform to the President's request, which is based on a balanced and affordable space and aeronautics program. The total authorizations for FY 2000 are approximately $50 million above the President's request, but important priorities are not funded at all.
Other specific objectionable features of the bill include:
The legislation also does not include important provisions contained in the Administration's reauthorization proposal. These provisions will, among other things, modernize NASA's statutes to recognize the importance of the commercial space industry.
Finally, the Administration will work with Congress to secure enactment of authorizations for NASA's High Performance Computing and Communication (HPCC) program and Information Technology for the 21st Century Initiative. Authorizations for these programs are essential to ensure continued United States leadership in information technology and to fulfillment of NASA's missions.
