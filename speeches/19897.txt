Dear Phil:
It is with a deep feeling of loss that I view your resignation later this month as Chairman of the Civil Service Commission and as my Adviser on Personnel Management. All during the past four years I have been reassured by the knowledge that you were devoting your many abilities to the strengthening of the civil service and the entire personnel structure of the Federal Government. I am certain that all who have participated in our frequent discussions of these matters will share my regret at your departure.
As you so well know, it has been the constant purpose of this Administration to improve the conditions of government service and attract to it those well-trained, dedicated, intelligent people who are so essential to the proper conduct of public affairs. Through the many programs you have helped to develop, and particularly through your own full devotion to the highest principles of public service, you have contributed immeasurably to the achievement of our purpose. Government personnel at all levels, indeed the nation as a whole, will long recognize your outstanding service.
You have my heartfelt thanks for your strong support during these four years. I am grateful, too, that you are willing to be of further service in the future.
With warm personal regard,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
