As chairman of the 1946 encampment of the VFW; as former commander of the VFW post named after my later brother Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr., Post No. 5580; and as a member of the Veterans' Subcommittee of the U.S. Senate for many years I am particularly sorry not to be able to address your convention in person. I had planned to come to Detroit and only the fact that the Senate is going to vote Tuesday on two of the most important sections of the most important legislation facing us this session - medical care for the aged - at 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., prevents me from coming to your meeting. I am sure you will agree that under these circumstances my responsibility is to be here. I extend my greetings to the VFW delegates throughout the United States and I share with you the hope that the 61st annual convention of your most constructive organization will be successful and rewarding. This is a difficult and dangerous time in the life of our country. I know that no member of the VFW feels that this service to our country is over. It is a continuing obligation which we are proud to meet.
JOHN F. KENNEDY,
