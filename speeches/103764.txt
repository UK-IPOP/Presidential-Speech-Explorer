The Claims Resolution Act of 2010 funds the Pigford II settlement with USDA ($1.15 billion) and the Cobell settlement with Interior ($3.4 billion). It also settles four Indian water rights disputes for seven Indian tribes in Arizona, Montana and New Mexico – the Crow, White Mountain Apache, and the Pueblos of Taos, Tesuque, Nambe, Pojoaque, and San Ildefonso. In addition, it provides a one-year extension of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grants, a six-month extension of the supplemental TANF grant program for states with high population growth or historically below-average welfare grants, and provisions to improve the integrity of the unemployment compensation program.
