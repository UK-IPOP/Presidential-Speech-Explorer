ROY ROBERTS was a true friend. He was my friend, but more than that, he was America's friend.
His ideals were America's ideals. His public service was performed in the loftiest tradition.
Americans who knew him will mourn his death. All of us join in thoughts and prayers for his wife and family. But all of us are sustained in our sadness by the living legacy he leaves.
