Dear Mr. Prime Minister:
I extend my congratulations to you and to the Liberal-Democratic Party on your election victory on November twentieth. I end my term of office as President of the United States with deep satisfaction over the close cooperation between our two countries, and with the knowledge that this cooperation will continue to grow and increase in the years ahead.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
