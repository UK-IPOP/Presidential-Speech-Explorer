Alexandria, VA - This morning, on the 14th anniversary of 9/11, Senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain joined Boston Herald Radio's Morning Meeting in a joint-interview with Hillary Chabot and Chris Villani. During the show, they discussed Senator McCain joining Graham on the campaign trail this weekend, the 9/11 attacks and how to prevent our homeland from getting hit again, and why Senator McCain believes that Lindsey Graham is the most qualified to be Commander-in-Chief out of the entire 2016 presidential field.
Senators Graham and McCain have been two of the leading critics of President Obama's strategy to "degrade and destroy" ISIL, and they continued to voice their concerns at a national security press conference Friday afternoon in Manchester, New Hampshire.
