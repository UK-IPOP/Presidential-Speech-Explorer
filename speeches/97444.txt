-President Bush, June 15, 2006
 This year's event will focus on the importance of ocean conservation to our national heritage, economy, and security. As children explore the White House grounds, they will learn about our oceans and how to preserve them for future generations. Through education and volunteerism, all families can make a difference in keeping our oceans clean.
 In 2004, the President released his Ocean Action Plan to promote an ethic of responsible use and preservation of our oceans and coastal resources. Of the 88 actions in the President's 2004 Ocean Action Plan, this Administration has met or is on schedule to meet all commitments, and more than a quarter of the existing actions have activities that "moved beyond" the initial commitments.
 Americans know that we must preserve our natural heritage and safeguard the environment for future generations. To keep our country and communities strong, President Bush created USA Freedom Corps to expand America's volunteer efforts and called on all Americans to engage in service.
