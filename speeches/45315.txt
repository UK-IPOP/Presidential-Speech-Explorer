The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 3456, because it:


— exceeds the President's Budget by $10.3 million over the fiscal year 1986-88 period; and

— establishes a personnel floor of 568 officers and employees for the CPSC, thereby interfering with the agency's ability to allocate resources among activities and programs that require specialized injury and illness assessments.
The Administration supports the provisions in S. 1077, the Senate-passed CPSC reauthorization bill, and will work in conference to eliminate the objectionable features of H.R. 3456.
