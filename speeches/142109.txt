Pool Reports by 
, 
Good morning from Wilmington.
Passing along this information from a White House Official: 
We have a lunch lid until 1:45 p.m.
The pool's bus met up with Biden's motorcade at 4:06 p.m. near his residence.
We haven't been given a destination but the timing suggests we're going to church.
The motorcade arrived at St. Joseph on the Brandywine at 4:08 p.m.
We saw POTUS enter the church’s front door, after leaving the side parking lot, as our bus stopped in front of the church.
POTUS exited the church at about 5 p.m. with some of his grandchildren.
He did not respond to shouted requests to come over where the pool was stationed outside the church’s front gate.
He did wave before getting in the vehicle.
We are rolling.
Pool broke away from the motorcade near POTUS’ home at about 5:08 p.m.
We have a lid.
?The grandchildren at church with POTUS were Natalie and Hunter - along with a friend.
