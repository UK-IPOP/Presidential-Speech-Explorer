I WANT to express great pleasure at two new distinguished members of the Atomic Energy Commission. Mr. Ramey has had long experience working with the Joint Committee which has played so large a role in the development of our atomic energy program. Mr. Palfrey I've known for a great many years and he has had particular and, I think, almost unique connection with important phases of this program. So I think we're very fortunate to have two men whose combined experience really covers the spectrum and I want to express my appreciation to them both, because they both had other responsibilities which they relinquished in order to accept these positions.
So we're glad, Mr. Chairman, to give you two strong right arms.
