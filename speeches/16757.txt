 unsafe practices continue to cause needless injuries and death to farm people; and
 widespread adoption of safer ways of working and living would save thousands of people from tragic injury or accidental death:
 President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the Nation to observe the week commencing July 24, 1949, as National Farm Safety Week, and I request all organizations and persons interested in farm life and welfare to join in a continuing drive against practices which endanger farm people in their homes, in the fields, and on the highways. I also urge each member of every farm family to study the hazards associated with rural life with a view to performing all tasks in the safest manner possible every day throughout the year.
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 28th day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-third.

HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
DEAN ACHESON,

Secretary of State.
