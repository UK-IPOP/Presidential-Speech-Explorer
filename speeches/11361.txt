 Proclamations No. 2525 of December 7, 1941, and Nos. 2526 and 2527 of December 8, 1941, relating to alien enemies, charge the Attorney General with the duty of executing all the regulations therein prescribed regarding the conduct of alien enemies within Alaska, and confer certain authority upon him with respect to such duty; and
 it appears that it would be desirable for administrative purposes to transfer such duty and authority to the Secretary of War:
 as President of the United States and as Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, do proclaim that the duty imposed upon the Attorney General by the aforesaid proclamations of executing all the regulations therein prescribed regarding the conduct of alien enemies within Alaska, and the authority conferred upon him with respect to such duty, are hereby transferred to the Secretary of War.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 29th day of December in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-one, and of the independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-sixth.
FRANKLIN D ROOSEVELT
By the President:
CORDELL HULL
