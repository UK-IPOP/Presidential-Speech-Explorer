DR. J. WALLACE JOYCE, Head of the International Geophysical Year Office of the National Science Foundation, has just informed me that the United States has successfully placed a scientific earth satellite in orbit around the earth. The satellite was orbited by a modified Jupiter-C rocket.
This launching is part of our country's participation in the International Geophysical Year. All information received from this satellite promptly will be made available to the scientific community of the world.
