 In his State of the Union Address, the President announced a 
 goal to reduce U.S. gasoline consumption by 20 percent over the next 10 years. Bipartisan legislation has been introduced in Congress that furthers the President's goals. Recognizing widespread consensus on the need to increase our fuel efficiency and use of alternative fuels, the President has called on Congress to pass by the start of the summer driving season legislation supporting the "Twenty in Ten" goal.
 To meet this goal we must make progress on two fronts:
 More than 700,000 hybrids have been sold in America. America's automakers are also working to develop "plug-in" hybrids that will use even less gasoline. These vehicles use advanced battery technology, such as lithium ion batteries, and could be recharged in a standard electrical outlet. They could go almost 40 miles on electricity alone, meaning that many Americans could do their entire daily commute without burning any gasoline.
 Scientists and engineers have made great progress on alternative fuels like biodiesel and ethanol.Our Nation is now on the threshold of dramatic breakthroughs like new forms of biodiesel and new ways of producing ethanol from wood chips, grasses, and agricultural wastes.
 As we continue to diversify our fuel supply, we must step up domestic oil production in environmentally sensitive ways. We also must double the current capacity of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to further protect America against severe disruptions to the world's oil supply.
 We are changing how America generates electricity by investing Federal resources in clean-coal technology, wind and solar energy, and clean, safe nuclear power.
