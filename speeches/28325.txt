Dear Bob:
It is with deep regret that I accept your resignation as Counsellor to the President. But it pleases me to know that you will be continuing to contribute your great talents to the cause of public service.
Your expertise and diligence have done more than I can say to help start this Administration on a course of fiscal responsibility that recognizes the careful balance which must be maintained between our needs and our resources. It has been a privilege to have you on my team and a pleasure to work with you.
As you move on to your new and important post, you take with you my sincere thanks for a job well done and best wishes for continuing achievement.

Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON

[Honorable Robert P. Mayo, Counsellor to the President, The White House, Washington, D.C.]
