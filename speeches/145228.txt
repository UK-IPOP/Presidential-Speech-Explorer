Judge Thomas B. Griffith, a retired Bush appointee to the D.C. Circuit of Appeals, endorsed Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's nomination to the Supreme Court in a letter written to the leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Last week, President Biden announced his intent to nominate Judge Jackson, one of our nation's brightest legal minds, as Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Judge Jackson's confirmation would be the first Black woman to sit on the nation's highest court.
Judge Griffith, nominated in 2004 by George W. Bush, served on the same appellate court on which Judge Jackson now sits. In endorsing Judge Jackson, he wrote, "Judge Jackson has a demonstrated record of excellence, and I believe, based upon her work as a trial judge when I served on the Court of Appeals, that she will adjudicate based on the facts and the law and not as a partisan," highlighting her "careful approach, extraordinary judicial understanding and collegial manner."
