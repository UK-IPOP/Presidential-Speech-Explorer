Mr. President and Senora Frondizi:

It is a very great privilege and honor to welcome you here as the head of a great nation for whom our people feel the kindliest sentiments of deep friendship. It is particularly a privilege because this is the first time that the President of Argentina has come to our country while he is in office. So we take it that you are paying to our country a great compliment in the effort that you have made to visit and see something of our country.
I assure you that here you will find the warmest of welcomes because on the human side your country, as is ours, is hoping to promote those great values of freedom and life of all the people. And I am sure that because of that kinship in the appreciation of values, our people will look on this visit as the hope of both our countries that we will march forward in realization of those objectives more strongly and more tightly bound together.
I am sure that your visit can do nothing better than to strengthen the friendship between our two countries and to make certain of better cooperation between two nations who have so much in common.

It is a great privilege, I assure you, to have you and your lovely wife here in this Capital.
