 This legislation also contains an Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) patch enabling millions of middle income families to avoid paying higher taxes in 2006.
 We reduced taxes for every American who pays income taxes, doubled the child tax credit, reduced the marriage penalty, created new incentives for small businesses to invest, and put the death tax on the road to extinction. The American people have used the tax relief to provide for their families, create jobs, and help make America's economy the envy of the industrialized world. The President's tax relief helped our economy grow at a strong 4.8 percent annual rate in the first quarter and helped our economy create more than 5.2 million jobs since August 2003.
 Lower tax rates on dividends and capital gains reduced the effective tax rate on business investment by more than 15 percent. When these cuts were passed in 2003, business investment had been dropping for several years. Since then, business investment has been growing at more than 9 percent per year. Spending on equipment and software has hit record levels, and businesses have hired millions of new workers to fill the jobs this investment creates.
 About half the households in America - 57 million in all - have some investment in the stock market. By cutting the taxes on dividends and capital gains, we helped add about $4 trillion in new wealth to the stock market and benefited Americans who own mutual funds, IRAs, and 401(k) plans.
Dividend Tax Relief Benefits The More Than 28 Million Americans Who Rely On Dividend Income. In 2003, 7 million seniors received income from dividends. 
 In 2005, about 4 million taxpayers were affected by the AMT. Without this temporary patch, the number would have risen to 22.2 million taxpayers in 2006.
 So far this year, tax revenues are 11 percent higher than at the same point last year, which is better than projected. More than a quarter of these new tax revenues come from corporations, who pay more taxes as they prosper in our growing economy. By growing the economy, we are staying on track to meet our goal of cutting the deficit in half by 2009.
 This follows our economic growth of 3.5 percent in 2005 - the fastest rate of any major industrialized nation last year.
 The unemployment rate is 4.7 percent, lower than the average of the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.
 Average hourly earnings have risen 3.8 percent over the past 12 months, their largest increase in nearly five years.
 Real after-tax income has risen by $2,398 (8.2 percent) per person since January 2001.
 Most Congressional Democrats voted against the President's 2001 and 2003 tax relief as well.
