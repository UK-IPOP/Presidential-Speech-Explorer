THE PRESIDENT and the Prime Minister received a very generous offer from the Hammer family to donate the Roosevelt cottage and surrounding grounds on Campobello island to the two countries to be used for public purposes which would appropriately commemorate that great President and good friend of Canada. The Prime Minister and the President, after consulting Premier Robichaud of New Brunswick where the island is situated, have accepted the offer with deep appreciation.
