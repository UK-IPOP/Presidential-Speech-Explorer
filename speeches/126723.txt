Donald Trump Hires the Foreign Students He Wants to Ban from Working 

  If elected president, Donald Trump has pledged to scrap a work visa program that brings 300,000 student workers each year to the U.S. Among the businesses that would be forced to stop hiring foreign labor: Trump's own.
The visa, known as the J-1, purports to offer a "cultural exchange" and give American businesses access to guest workers' "specialized skills," according to the State Department. Trump says it's a simply a conciliatory gesture aimed at corporate interests seeking cheap labor â€” and he'd replace it "with a resume bank for inner city youth provided to all corporate subscribers to the J-1 visa program."
Yet Trump's hotel in Chicago has been a regular user of J-1 visas, according to workers at the hotel and Irish students who worked there. The nexus of the hiring has been the hotel's elite Terrace Restaurant, though other J-1 students have been placed at reception and at other hotel eating establishments. . . .
In an emailed statement to The Associated Press, Trump said that his approach to J-1 visas would be different as president than it had been as a businessman.
