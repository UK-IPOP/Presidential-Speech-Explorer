Des Moines, Iowa – John Edwards will kick off a week-long bus tour across Iowa on August 13, 2007, stopping in 30 counties and meeting with thousands of caucus goers. The 2007 "Fighting for One America" bus tour will take Edwards from the Iowa State Fair to town hall meetings and community gatherings across the state, culminating in the August 19th Democratic Presidential Debate at Drake University.
"I'm looking forward to this trip and talking with Iowans about our fight to build One America — an America where everyone has a chance to get ahead and where the needs of regular Americans come before the needs of powerful special interests," Edwards said. "This will be a great opportunity to meet with Iowans from across the state and share with them my vision for bold change in America."
During the 7-day tour, Edwards will once again drive the Democratic agenda by leading with bold vision and transformational ideas, including discussions of his specific plans to fight for real change in Iowa and all across America.
Additional details about the trip will be released next week. The route and communities Edwards will visit are listed below.
