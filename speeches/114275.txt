"By any measure, middle-class Americans aren't better off in the Obama economy. This week alone, industrial production plummeted, poverty remained stuck at record levels, and families continued to struggle with fewer jobs and higher costs.

Mitt Romney will reverse the Obama economy's decline by creating 12 million new jobs and higher take-home pay for American workers." â€” Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
