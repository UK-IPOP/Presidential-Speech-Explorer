The Administration supports the authorization of appropriations for the Office of Environmental Quality. Further, the President is firmly committed to ensuring that the environmental impacts of Federal extraterritorial activities are properly considered. The Administration supports, for example, Sec. 5(a)(1) of H.R. 1113 to ensure consideration of the "significant effects of its major actions on the environment of the global commons outside the jurisdiction of any Nation." The Administration will be reevaluating Executive Order (E.O.) 12114, which requires an environmental review of certain defined major Federal actions that would have a significant effect on the environment outside the United States' geographic borders. This reevaluation will focus on ensuring that E.O. 12114 is accomplishing its intended purpose of ensuring that pertinent environmental aspects of all major U.S. activities abroad are fully considered and addressed, along with other pertinent considerations of national policy.

The Administration, nonetheless, has the following serious concerns about H.R. 1113.

Notwithstanding these concerns the Administration supports strengthening the consideration given to environmental impacts of projects that have major U.S. participation, and is committed to achieving this objective.
