[Released January 9, 1933. Dated January 3, 1933]
THE ANNUAL DINNERS of the Society of the Genesee represent in high degree the expression of a sentiment typically American. Our native individualism often carries us far from our early haunts, but by such gatherings as yours we recall the scenes of our youth and enshrine our early homes in happy memory. As long as we maintain this contact with the past we maintain the continuity of American tradition. I send my best wishes to the Society of the Genesee and my congratulations to your guest of honor, Edward Bausch of Rochester.
