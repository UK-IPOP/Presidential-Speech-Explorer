The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 5193, a bill designed to enhance the efforts of the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Defense to share medical care resources. The Administration, however, will work with the Senate to delete the bill's provision authorizing the waiver of certain copayments for CHAMPVA and CHAMPUS beneficiaries.

It is widely recognized by health care providers that copayments provide incentives to use health care services appropriately. It would not be sound health care policy to remove them. In addition, this provision would increase utilization and could impose new costs on the CHAMPUS and CHAMPVA programs.
