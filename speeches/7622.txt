[Released June 23, 1930. Dated June 21, 1930]
UPON THE occasion of the termination of the International Exposition at Seville, which has given such brilliant expression to the close association of Spain and all of the Americas, I send you this message of greeting. In the name of my countrymen, many of whom have visited the Exposition and been impressed by its cultural significance, I congratulate you heartily on the great success achieved.
