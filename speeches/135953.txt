"I applaud the Senate for confirming Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court. After one of the most exhaustive background checks in the history of the Senate's ‘advice and consent' role, Judge Kavanaugh has proven he has the integrity and judicial temperament to serve on the nation's highest court."

"I've said from the day the President announced Judge Kavanaugh's nomination on July 9 that Judge Kavanaugh is quite possibly the most qualified person ever nominated to the Supreme Court. He has spent 25 years of his career at the highest levels of government, including the last twelve years as a judge on the second most important federal court in the country. Judge Kavanaugh's record on the D.C. Circuit has been remarkable. On a court containing some of the brightest legal minds, he has set himself apart."

In accordance with my constitutional right to ‘advice and consent,' I advise that Judge Kavanaugh be the next associate justice on the Supreme Court of the United States."

"Judge Kavanaugh is a mainstream jurist with a clear record of applying the law as written, consistent with the Constitution. His record as a member of the D.C. Circuit Court shows he has voted with the majority of that court 97 percent of the time, and his reasoning has been adopted by the U.S. Supreme Court thirteen times."
