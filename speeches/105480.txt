There's been a lot of pick-up on my item about changes in the new paperback edition of Mitt Romney's "No Apology." I didn't have room to provide more than a summary there, so I thought I'd provide more of the changes here, so people can judge for themselves.
Bear in mind that the remainder of the book (other than the new introduction) is virtually unchanged â€” aside from the two sections I wrote about, I could only identify five paragraphs altered in the entire book, all of which were either to change something to past tense, or to remove something that is no longer true (eg, "there has never been an oil spill from an offshore platform"). Oh, and to remove journalist Nina Easton from the acknowledgements. (Perhaps at her request, after she got grief for the ethics of advising Romney.)

Over the next several paragraphs, there are a few other removals and changes, mostly removing suggestions or hints about how to do national health-care reform right. One good example comes at the end of a paragraph boasting of the success of his plan in Massachusetts. The original paragraph ends with this sentence:
That has been replaced with:
The biggest change, however, is the addition of seven paragraphs at the end of the section. Here are some excerpts:
