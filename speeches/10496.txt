MORTALITY in the United States during the year just ended was as low as in 1930 and definitely lower than in the 2 previous years. This fact is indicated by records already available. In 82 large cities the mortality rate from all causes for 1931 was 11.7 per 1,000 against 11.9 in 1930, 48 cities showing a decrease, and 28 an increase, and 6 remaining the same. Among 75 million industrial policyholders the death rate in 1931 was the same as in 1930 and appreciably below the 1928 and 1929 rates. Available data from the entire population of a number of States for the first three quarters of the year confirm these indications.
Of special interest is the last quarter of 1931, since it includes the beginning of winter, when mortality is commonly experienced. Records for this last quarter in the group of 82 large cities, as compared with the same period in the 3 preceding years, indicate that the mortality at the beginning of the winter of 1931-32 has continued on a very favorable level, the rate being only 10.7 per 1,000 as compared to 11.4, 12.0, and 13.2 in the last quarters of 1930, 1929, and 1928, respectively. Industrial policyholders likewise manifest a low mortality during the last 3 months of 1931, the rate in this group being 8.7 per 1,000 during that period as compared to 9.0, 9.1, and 9.4 during the last quarter of 1930, 1929, and 1928, respectively.
More precise measures of the trend of mortality during the past year are not yet available, for instance, with respect to specific causes or in particular age groups. Data appear to indicate, however, a continuation of the downward trend of mortality from pulmonary tuberculosis and many other causes.
Infant mortality during the past year, based on the number of deaths under 1 year of age per 1,000 live births, in 70 large cities, was definitely lower than in any preceding year on record, the rate being 55.8 against 58.1 for 1930, the most favorable preceding year. This especially creditable showing has persisted during the last weeks of the year, the rate for the final quarter being 46.6 against an average of 56.9 for the corresponding period in the 3 preceding years and against 51.9 for the same period of 1929, the lowest previous rate.
Responses from State, city, and local health officers to inquiries regarding health conditions generally confirm the impression given by the data quoted above that 1931 has been a favorable year. While in certain local areas reports indicate an increase in malnutrition among children, the reports in general for 1931 show an improvement in this condition. Many more people are asking for charity medical services and this gives the impression at first that there is an increase in sickness, but to counterbalance this there are many reports of decreases in paid medical practice. To meet this added burden upon free clinics and hospitals, there has been an increase in local contributions for such purposes.
