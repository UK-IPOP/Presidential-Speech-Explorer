PRESIDENT TRUMAN, in his usual forthright manner, has spoken out against the rapid escalation in interest rates. As I said in December, and have repeated several times since, I, too, am concerned about the interest rate rise and what it means to many Americans. However, I cannot agree with President Truman that our economy is in danger of recession or depression.
The tightness of money mainly reflects the extreme buoyancy of our economy and the resulting very sharp rise in the demand for credit. These are symptoms of strength, not weakness. But we need to find better ways to restrain inflationary pressures than by resorting merely to the high interest rates we have been witnessing.
