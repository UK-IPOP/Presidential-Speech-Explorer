"President Obama and Vice President Biden have crisscrossed the country talking to college graduates – but one thing they haven't mentioned is the impact their failed liberal policies have had on the job market. After trillions in wasteful spending and new debt, college graduates – like all Americans – need a leader like Mitt Romney who knows how to get our economy moving again." –Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson

 "About 1.5 million, or 53.6 percent, of bachelor's degree-holders under the age of 25 last year were jobless or underemployed, the highest share in at least 11 years. In 2000, the share was at a low of 41 percent, before the dot-com bust erased job gains for college graduates in the telecommunications and IT fields."

 "Out of the 1.5 million who languished in the job market, about half were underemployed, an increase from the previous year. Broken down by occupation, young college graduates were heavily represented in jobs that require a high school diploma or less." (Hope Yen, "1 In 2 New Graduates Are Jobless Or Underemployed,"

 "First, you're going to have a hell of a hard time finding a job. The job market you're heading into is still bad. Fewer than half of the graduates from last year's class have as yet found full-time jobs. Most are still looking. That's been the pattern over the last three graduating classes: It's been taking them more than a year to land the first job. And those who still haven't found a job will be competing with you, making your job search even harder." (Robert B. Reich, "The Commencement Address That Won't Be Given,"

 "How hard has the Great Recession hit young adults in the U.S.? According to a report released Thursday by the Pew Research Center, only 54.3% of young adults aged 18 to 24 have a job. It's the lowest rate since the government started keeping records in 1948." (Josh Sanburn, "Fewest Young Adults In 60 Years Have Jobs,"
