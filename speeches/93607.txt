The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsements of Indiana Democratic Party Chairman Dan Parker and 16 other leading party officials.
"Indiana is ready for change, and Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to deliver it," Parker said.
"Hillary is uniquely qualified to hit the ground running on her first day in office and begin tackling the challenges we face at home and abroad," said Democratic National Committee Member Phoebe Crane.
"Hillary's impressive record of working across the aisle to get things done is the kind of consensus-building leadership we need to provide quality, affordable health care for every American and move our nation towards energy independence," said Democratic National Committee Member Bob Pastrick.
"I am grateful for the overwhelming support I've received in Indiana," Clinton said. "With the help of these local leaders, we'll take our message of change across the state and this nation."
