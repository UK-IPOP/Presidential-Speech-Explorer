[Released September 6, 1965. Dated September 3, 1965] Dear Miss Fuller:
My best wishes to you on your 91st birthday.
Since you became the first Social Security beneficiary in January, 1940, the size of the program--and of the more than 300 monthly checks you have received--has grown steadily. That growth means increased well-being for older people, widows and orphans everywhere in the Nation.
On July 30, I had the pleasure of signing an act which increased monthly benefits by seven per cent. As a major new advance, it added health insurance protection for the aging to the social security law.
This increase is retroactive to January-and so this month you are receiving an extra social security check for the amount of the increase due you for the months of January through August.
I am happy that you can receive this "bonus" check on your birthday; I hope that you receive it--and many others--in good health.

With kindest regards,

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Miss Ida Fuller, 33 Pleasant Street, Ludlow, Vermont]
