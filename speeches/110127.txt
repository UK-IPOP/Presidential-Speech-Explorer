He opposed right-to-work legislation and supported Big Labor's priorities on numerous occasions. Americans concerned about a healthy job market and economic growth will have to ask Senator Santorum if this was just another example of putting principles aside to 'take one for the team.'" â€”Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 "[Santorum] got a major boost Monday in Ohio from the big-money intervention of an unlikely source: one of the country's premier unions. The real endorsement of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) will go to President Obama. But with a half-million-dollar ad purchase aimed at persuading voters in the Ohio Republican primary not to vote for Mitt Romney, disclosed Tuesday, the union seems to be working hard for a Santorum-versus-Obama faceoff in November."
