There are, perhaps, no questions in which the public has more acute interest than those relating to the disposition of the public domain. I am just in receipt from the Secretary of the Interior of recommendation that in disposition of important legal questions which he is called upon to decide relating to the public lands, an appeal be authorized from his decision to the court of appeals for the District of Columbia.
I fully indorse the views of the Secretary in this particular, which are set forth in his letter, transmitted herewith, and urge upon the Congress an early consideration of the subject.
