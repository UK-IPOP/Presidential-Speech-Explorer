To the Congress of the United States:
Today I am transmitting the 7th Annual Report on the status of the National Wilderness Preservation System. The Report spells out the substantial progress which has been made in the Wilderness System, a System which now encompasses more than 10.1 million acres--an increase of over 200,000 acres in the last year.
On April 28, 1971, I transmitted fourteen new wilderness proposals to the Congress. If approved, these proposals would enlarge our Wilderness System by an additional 1.8 million acres. Again, I urge quick and favorable congressional action on these proposals as well as on thirteen other proposals which are also before the Congress and which would add over a million acres to the System. Wilderness designation of all these areas is vital if we are to preserve their natural environment for future generations of Americans.
