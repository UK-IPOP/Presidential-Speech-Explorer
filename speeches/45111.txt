The Administration strongly supports a five year reauthorization of the Superfund program. 
. Further, the Administration strongly opposes enactment of H.R. 2817 unless it is amended to:


— 
. Such litigation would be extremely costly, impose huge burdens on the courts, and result in program priorities being set by a variety of different courts;

— 
. This will result in delays and require mope stringent but excessively costly cleanup than at non-Federal sites while providing little, if any, additional health protection;

— 
. Establishment of a massive new Fund is not warranted when no information is available yet to determine the size of the problem that exists or whether it can be adequately dealt with under the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984; and

— 
. Funding of O&M is an inappropriate Federal role and would set a bad precedent for other Federal construction programs under which funding is a State or local responsibility.
In order to effect the above changes, the Administration supports granting a modified open rule.

:


— 
. This provision will simply divert money from Superfund's primary mission, to protect human health, to low priority environmental restoration activity;

— 
. With proper oversight, private parties should be permitted to perform these activities. This will allow an accelerated pace of cleanup activities nationwide; and

— 
 to include suits against persons responsible for releases posing an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health or the environment. This will interfere with EPA's ability to set priorities for cleanup, and will slow down cleanup efforts nation-wide.
