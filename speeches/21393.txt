Senator KENNEDY. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, I have come here today to request your help in this election. Whenever it rains, the Republicans go inside, but we stay outside and fight. [Applause.]
We are up here today in a campaign. We are up here today, in Yonkers, in a campaign to ask your support, to ask you to join us, to ask you to build a stronger country. I ask your help. [Applause.]
Our obligation is to build a stronger country. We seek in our party today to serve the United States, to move it forward, and rain or shine, good times or bad, this country is going to move in the sixties. Thank you. [Applause.]
