I HAVE received today the fourth volume of the report on Science and Public Policy, submitted by John R. Steelman in accordance with Executive Order 9791. This volume, entitled "Manpower for Research," deals with the shortage of scientists and scientist-teachers, the implications of that shortage, and the remedial steps that must be taken.
The shortage of highly trained scientists both for teaching and for research is the basic factor which sets the limits of the Nation's scientific progress. The remedial program suggested in the report calls for financial support to colleges and universities and to deserving students. Specific ways for accomplishing these objectives are now being studied by the President's Commission on Higher Education.
