 The American people understand that Social Security is headed for serious financial trouble and the President believes it is our duty to make Social Security permanently solvent. The President also believes it is our responsibility to improve the system by directing extra help to those most in need and making it a better deal for younger workers.
 ensure that future generations receive benefits equal to or greater than today's seniors; protect those who depend on Social Security the most; and replace the empty promises being made to younger workers with real money.
 Seniors and people with disabilities will continue to get their checks, and all Americans born before 1950 will also receive their full benefits.
 Under any plan to reform Social Security, future generations should receive benefits equal to or greater than the benefits that seniors receive today.
 President Bush has made it clear that we must provide extra help to those future seniors who need it most.
 Younger workers should have the option of putting a portion of their payroll taxes into a voluntary personal account which will allow them to build a nest egg that belongs to them. This money will give workers an opportunity to receive a higher rate of return than the current Social Security System can provide.
 Social Security is too important to pass this problem on to the next generation. The President has committed to work with both the House and Senate in a bipartisan way as they take the next steps in the legislative process.
