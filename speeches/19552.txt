I AM GRATIFIED that the Department of State has concluded with the Soviet Ambassador to the United States an agreement contemplating certain exchanges in the cultural, technical and educational fields. I hope that the arrangement will be implemented in the same spirit which has animated the negotiations. I sincerely trust that through such agreements a better understanding will result ,between the peoples of the United States and the Soviet Union.
