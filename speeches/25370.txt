THE COOPERATION of all the executive branches has been outstanding. I am proud of the results which are being obtained without impairing the quality or quantity of vital Federal services. The closer scrutiny of our manpower practices will, I am certain, serve to enhance the efficiency of the Federal establishment. I hope you will convey to all concerned my personal appreciation and congratulations.
