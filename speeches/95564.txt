 Washington needs change. For decades, our leaders have made far too many promises but delivered too few solutions. No where is that more known than in Michigan. By actually meeting the challenges of today and fixing Washington, we can help strengthen states like Michigan. As part of his strategy to build a stronger America, Governor Romney has proposed a bold To Do List that will help Michigan. Earlier today, Governor Romney addressed the need to help Michigan.
- 
 "And I recognize that when Michigan is hurting, it is a precursor of what could happen to the entire country. Because our manufacturing base, if it's threatened there, it's threatened everywhere. And so for me, Michigan is not just, oh, one state that I hope they're doing well. No, for me, Michigan is a state that has to do well. Michigan is a state going through a one-state recession." (Governor Mitt Romney, Remarks, 1/9/08)
- 
 "They've elected Jennifer Granholm, a liberal Democrat, as their governor and the laboratory experiment is out. Her taxes are going up, unemployment rates are high, housing prices are collapsing, the auto industry is not thriving. It ain't working and you're going to find that that experiment is going to be rejected by the people of Michigan who want instead, somebody who knows, cares and loves that state and will fight very hard to help it come out of its one-state recession. I'll make a commitment: if I'm president, that one-state recession is over." (Governor Mitt Romney, Remarks, 1/9/08)
- 
 "Folks who come from Michigan recognize, like people across this country, that Washington has failed them time and again. That Washington has made promises and not delivered on those promises and they are tired of waiting for change. And we will bring change. You heard about illegal immigration, they promised change there, they haven't delivered. You heard about reducing the tax burden on the middle class and burdens on the middle class, they haven't delivered on that. We've talked about improving our schools, that hasn't been delivered. Getting health care for all of our citizens, that hasn't been delivered. And one, that as you know, Michigan cares about most deeply, and that is rebuilding and strengthening our economy, helping elevate wages, growing our middle class, making sure that we lead the world in technology and innovation and design and patents. It's been promised time and again, and I will actually get the job done because I have done it before." (Governor Mitt Romney, Remarks, 1/9/08)
 Across America, there are thousands of families with members in the Armed Forces, Reserves and National Guard who need more support from Washington. To make America safer, Governor Romney will:
- 
- 
 This will help provide the resources needed for equipment, modernization, training and care for our wounded soldiers.
- 
 Governor Romney will bring together a team of private-sector and defense experts to carry out a stem-to-stern review of military purchasing.
- 
 The SPF will integrate all elements of national power under a new force with leadership drawn from our Army Special Forces trained to work with civilian governments and intelligence personnel to form a new capability to help defeat the Jihadists.
- 
 The Rapid Innovation Force will rapidly deploy the equipment and innovative solutions our troops need for their success and protection.
 America's strength is amplified when it is combined with the strength of other nations. We need to expand alliances such as NATO and efforts among the world's leading nations to face the new threat of radical Jihad and increase our homeland security. To make America safer, Governor Romney will:
- 
 As President, Governor Romney will call together our Middle East allies and the major nations of the developed world to establish a Partnership for Prosperity and Progress. This Partnership will assemble the resources of all developed nations to assure that threatened Islamic states have public schools, micro-credit and banking, the rule of law, human rights, basic health care, and competitive economic policies.
- 
 The Global Network will link intelligence and law enforcement capabilities around the world to share data about border crossings, biometric indicators, passport fraud, nuclear and biological threats, criminal patterns, human trafficking and drug trafficking.
 Today, protecting the homeland must begin far from home. Intelligence and law enforcement efforts able to address threats before they reach our shores must be a priority for U.S. and international action. To make America safer, Governor Romney will:
- 
 We need to eliminate duplicative efforts, revitalize recruitment and prioritize efforts in the field, expanding human intelligence.
- 
 The Patriot Act has given our men and women in the law enforcement and intelligence communities the tools they need to defend America.
- 
 Our most basic civil liberty is the right to be kept alive and Governor Romney will use every tool at our disposal to keep America safe.
 America's immigration system is broken, but for too long all our leaders in Washington have done is talk about ending illegal immigration. Governor Romney believes we must enforce and reform our immigration laws so that we can end illegal immigration. To end illegal immigration, Governor Romney will:
- 
 Governor Romney will follow through on the Congressional commitment to build a physical and technological fence along the southern border, and secure other points of entry throughout the country.
- 
 Governor Romney will issue a biometrically-enabled and tamper-proof card to non-citizens and create a national database so employers can easily verify the legal status of non-citizens in this country.
- 
 Governor Romney will make it easier for employers to verify legal status and work authorization of non-citizens through a federal database. Employers will be held accountable if they hire illegal immigrants with stiffer fines and penalties.
- 
 Governor Romney opposes amnesty or any special path to citizenship for those here illegally.
- 
 Governor Romney will cut back federal funding to cities that are "sanctuaries" for illegal immigrants.
- 
 Governor Romney opposes giving driver's licenses or in-state tuition to those here illegally. He believes states should not provide those types of incentives. As President, he will cut back federal funding to states that do so.
- 
 More state and local authorities should work with the federal government to enforce immigration laws.
- 
 Governor Romney will provide additional resources to enforce existing immigration laws throughout the nation.
- 
 Governor Romney believes we must teach English in our classrooms because to be successful you have to speak the language of America.
- 
 Governor Romney believes we should end the policy of chain migration that says if a child is born here to illegal immigrants then, by right, the entire family is brought in based upon that child's citizenship.
- 
 Governor Romney will streamline the visa system to recruit and retain skilled workers in high demand by U.S. companies. He will also welcome the best and the brightest from around the world to our universities.
 Lower taxes are the key to ensuring continued economic growth and job creation. However, our economy is threatened by looming tax hikes. To reduce taxes, Governor Romney will:
- 
 Making the Bush Tax Cuts permanent is the first step to ensuring that Americans are able to keep more of their hard-earned money.
- 
 As President, Governor Romney will cut marginal tax rates across the board, allowing all Americans to save more money.
- 
 Governor Romney's plan will allow middle class Americans to save tax free by changing the tax rate on interest, capital gains and dividends to absolutely 0%.
- 
 It is unfair to tax Americans three times: once when they earn their money; second when they invest it and receive income from those investments; and third when they die.
- 
 The United States has the second highest corporate tax rate in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. We cannot afford to have a tax rate that is out of alignment with the other major economies of the world.
- 
 We can strengthen Social Security without resorting to higher Social Security taxes that will impact all Americans. Governor Romney will oppose any proposed increase in Social Security taxes.
- 
 At the very least, Congress must pass a patch to the AMT that will prevent this tax from affecting more and more families in America.
 Governor Romney will work to ensure that America's economy, businesses and workers have the tools they need to compete in this global economy. To grow the economy and keep our jobs, Governor Romney will:
- 
 Governor Romney will seek to bring together nations committed to open markets and playing by the rules in the largest ever Free Trade Area, and go beyond traditional trade to promote high standards in areas critical to U.S. competitiveness.
- 
 The Doha Round and free trade agreements can be huge opportunities for America.
- 
 Governor Romney's vision for expanding trade includes stronger enforcement efforts, multilateral efforts to stop currency manipulation, action against intellectual property rights theft, negotiations to open markets for services, and building food, safety and other standards to protect Americans.
- 
- 
 These self-managed accounts will give workers the opportunity to take control of their own futures by getting the training and education they need to succeed in the new economy.
- 
 Governor Romney will initiate an audit of all existing worker training and educational programs to ensure that workers are being helped most efficiently.
- 
 As President, Governor Romney will eliminate cumbersome and unnecessary regulations and bureaucracies that hinder economic growth.
- 
 As President, Governor Romney will emphasize math and science education, while promoting innovative approaches such as charter schools and public-private partnerships.
- 
 Americans are concerned about the overspending in Washington. Like the millions of families and businesses across the country, government should also live within a budget. To end Washington's spending binge, Governor Romney will:
- 
 He will veto any non-defense appropriations bill that grows spending at a rate greater than inflation minus one percent (CPI-1%). This will save $300 billion over 10 years.
- 
 Restoring this power to the President would allow us to make tremendous strides in eliminating earmarks and cutting inefficient programs.
- 
 Governor Romney's administration will undertake an exhaustive review of each individual federal program to eliminate and consolidate programs that are no longer useful or are bureaucratic and unwieldy.
- 
 The amount of money Congress tells the President to spend should be a spending ceiling, not a final price tag.
- 
 Making it even harder to attempt to increase taxes will help impose the fiscal discipline we need to stop overspending.
 Government in Washington has become duplicative, burdensome and inefficient. Our government is broken and can only be changed with someone from outside of Washington free of any special interest. To make government simpler and smaller, Governor Romney will:
- 
 Governor Romney's administration will undertake an exhaustive review of each individual federal program to eliminate and consolidate programs that are no longer useful or are bureaucratic and unwieldy.
 Governor Romney has outlined a comprehensive solution to America's health care ills that expands access to affordable, portable, quality, private health insurance. For too long, too many have talked about reforming health care. To make health care more affordable, Governor Romney will:
- 
- 
 - 
 - 
 - 
 - 
 Energy costs that put pressure on household finances are a major concern for families. Yet, for too long, Washington insiders have talked about making America energy independent. To end our dependence on foreign oil, Governor Romney will:
- 
 Because energy independence is crucial to our economy and national security, Governor Romney will make it a top administration priority to become energy independent.
- 
 This investment will encourage the commercialization of alternative energy.
- 
 Governor Romney will pursue our domestic sources of energy, drawing from our broad and diverse base of options, including opening ANWR.
- 
 Governor Romney will shift federal priorities to emphasize issues of energy security, particularly at the Department of Energy.
- 
 Governor Romney will accelerate the construction of new nuclear power plants in order to ensure that nuclear power continues to be a part of a robust, cleaner and more reliable energy mix.


 By 2050, total entitlement spending by the government will reach nearly 20% of America's GDP. This reality demands action now. Future generations can no longer afford inaction. To fix Social Security, Governor Romney will:
- 
 In a forthright and bipartisan manner, Governor Romney will work with Congress to find a bipartisan way to reform Social Security while opposing higher Social Security taxes.
 Washington is failing our veterans. Governor Romney believes we must do more to support our men and women in uniform, their families and those who have returned home after serving their country. To enhance care for our veterans and military families, Governor Romney will:
 Governor Romney will call for a regular outside review of Montgomery G.I. Bill benefits to ensure that our veterans, active duty military, and their eligible spouses and dependents have the resources they need to pursue the opportunities they deserve.
 Governor Romney will call on every state to extend in-state tuition benefits to military dependents whose parents are stationed there and, furthermore, to permit the continuation of the in-state tuition rate even if their parents are reassigned and forced to leave the state.
 Far too often, the American people have been forced to put up with the ethical problems of our nation's representatives in Washington. Those we elect should live up to a higher standard. To bring a higher standard to Washington, Governor Romney will:
- 
 Any elected official or federal official who violates the public's trust should be stripped of the taxpayer funded pensions.
 As President, one of Governor Romney's first acts will be to issue an Executive Order prohibiting the immediate family of an Cabinet or Senior Staff member from lobbying the Executive Branch.
