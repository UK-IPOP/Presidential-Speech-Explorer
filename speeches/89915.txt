Trip Includes Events and Town Halls Across Iowa
 This Saturday, May 26th, 2007, Sen. Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden will kick-off a six-day campaign trip across Iowa. This extensive campaign swing - with stops in towns both large and small - includes town hall meetings and house parties with local Democrats to discuss the Senators plan for Iraq and his vision for America. During the trip, Sen. Biden will also speak at Johnson and Black Hawk County Democratic Party events.
This trip, from Saturday, May 26th to Thursday, May 31st, will be Senator Biden's third to the state this month. During his first trip early this month, Biden received endorsements from several key state and county lawmakers and officials. Late last week, he returned to the state where he spoke at the Dubuque County Democratic Party Hall of Fame Dinner.
