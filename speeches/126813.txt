People say every four years that the upcoming presidential election is the most important one in the country's history. After seven years of radical, divisive, class warfare, against-the-will-of-the-people rule by President Barack Obama, the statement has merit in 2016.
Rubio offers an opportunity to turn that page to energize the American workforce, strengthen the country around the world, widen educational opportunities, staunch the porous Southern border from illegal immigration, grow the Republican Party and, just as importantly, make people proud of their country again.
For governance, for soundness of mind, for electability and for the best opportunity for the country to return to the "shining city on a hill" that former President Ronald Reagan often spoke of, we encourage a vote in the presidential preference primary for Marco Rubio.
