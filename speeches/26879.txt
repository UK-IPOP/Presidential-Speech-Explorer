GENERAL HUMPHREYS, a career officer in the Air Force Medical Corps, has just returned from 2 years in Vietnam. He was there, as part of our AID program, to help develop a national medical program for the Vietnamese people.
In the midst of war, he was deeply committed to advancing the works of peace. And he succeeded outstandingly.
When he arrived, there were 80 Americans working on health programs for the benefit of that sorely beset people. Today there are some 900--eleven times as many. And they have been joined by some 500 medical personnel from other free nations.
They are now at work in 40 provincial hospitals, district, village, and hamlet health stations throughout South Vietnam.
Their work has revolutionized the care of the sick. They have brought hope where once there was only despair. They have helped us, and the Government of Vietnam, demonstrate anew that we are determined to bring them the better life for which they long, and which is their right.
