A WORLDWIDE early warning system for drugs will be a vital health protection measure for people everywhere. Increasingly powerful and sophisticated drugs emerge from laboratories as boons to the struggle against man's bodily afflictions. In actual use, however, some drugs have had unexpected and tragic consequences before medical communities could become aware of unpredictable side effects. This worldwide early warning system is a big step forward in protecting all people from these unforeseen hazards. We are glad to make this grant to assist in its establishment.
