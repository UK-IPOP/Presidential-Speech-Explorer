To the Nation's Christmas Tree Association:
Your Christmas service held each year at the foot of a living tree which was alive at the time of the birth of Christ, has now for several years lent an inspiring note to the celebration of Christmas. It should be continued as a further symbol of the unbroken chain of life leading back to this great moment in the spiritual life of mankind.
