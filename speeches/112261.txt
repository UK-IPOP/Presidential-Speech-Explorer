Today, Romney for President released a new web video, "Our Time." Three years after President Obama proudly proclaimed that the economy was his, more than 23 million Americans are still out of work, underemployed, or no longer looking for work and we've seen forty straight months of unemployment over 8 percent. Just last week, the President said the economy "isn't where it needs to be." President Obama has had his moment and failed. Now it is our time.
: 
 "So I welcome the job. I want the responsibility..."
 "Give it to me."
 "Of course the economy isn't where it needs to be."
 "Well Mr. President, you've had your moment. We've seen the results. And now Mr. President, this is our time."
