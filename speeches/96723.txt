Philadelphia, PA - U.S. Senator Barack Obama's Presidential campaign today begins airing a new television ad featuring U.S. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA). In the ad - entitled "It Won't" - Senator Casey expresses Pennsylvania voters' frustration with a system that has been long on division and political games and short on solutions to the problems that ail them.
"In towns like yours and mine, families are struggling with bills they can't afford and jobs moving away," Casey tells viewers. "It has to change - but it won't until we change Washington."
