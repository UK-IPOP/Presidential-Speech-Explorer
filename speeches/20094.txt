[Released May 31, 1957. Dated May 27, 1957]
My dear Mr. President,
I have received your communication telling me that it will not be possible for you to come for your visit at the beginning of June. I want you to know that Mrs. Eisenhower and I were looking forward to the pleasure of welcoming you to this country and we very much regret that your trip cannot be made at this time. We sincerely hope it may be possible for you to make the visit at a later date.
Please accept, Mr. President, the assurances of my highest esteem.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
