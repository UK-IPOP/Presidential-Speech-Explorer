To the Congress of the United States:
I am transmitting herewith for your consideration a suggested Joint Resolution providing for United States membership and participation in the World Health Organization. I also am enclosing a memorandum from the Secretary of State with reference to United States membership in the World Health Organization.
I have been impressed by the spirit of international good will and community of purpose which have characterized the development of the Constitution of this Organization. I am sure that it will make a substantial contribution to the improvement of world health conditions through the years.
In view of the significance and urgency of international health problems, I consider it important that the United States join the World Health Organization as soon as possible. Therefore, I hope that the suggested Joint Resolution may have the early consideration of Congress.
HARRY S. TRUMAN
