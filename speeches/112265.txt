"During his time in office, President Obama has repeatedly shown how out of touch he is with the realities of our economy. Two years ago today, he kicked off a 'Recovery Summer' campaign that never arrived. Now, he claims the private sector is 'doing fine.' Time and again, President Obama has shown an extraordinary misunderstanding of how our economy works. From day one of his presidency, Mitt Romney will deliver pro-growth policies that will get our country back on track and get Americans back to work." –Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson

 VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: "This is a monumental project, but I think it's doable. But I just think we got to stay on top of it and we got to stay on top of it on a weekly basis. Because this is about getting this out and spent in 18 months to create 3.5 million jobs and do – to set – tee this up so the rest of the good work that's being done here literally drop-kicks us out of this recession and we begin to grow again and begin to grow again."
