 "In 1996 Republicans are as good as their word, and grant the opposition's Bill Clinton a broad new power to strip wasteful spending. Mr. Clinton is enthusiastic, and in August 1997 uses his tool for the first time to strike down a special-interest provision tucked in a bill. That provision gives New York hospitals a unique right to bilk extra Medicaid money, and the veto is expected to save federal taxpayers at least $200 million." (Kimberley A. Strassel, "Rudy's Big Apple Baggage,"

 "It was estimated that the veto would save the Federal Government at least $200 million." (Alison Mitchell, "President Makes First Use Of New Veto,"

 "New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani challenged the constitutionality of the presidential line-item veto on Thursday in a federal lawsuit seeking to keep New York from losing Medicaid funds. President Clinton's August veto 'unfairly targets the city and the state of New York,' Giuliani said. The suit was filed in U.S. District Court here." (Tom Raum, "N.Y. Mayor Fights Line-Item Veto,"

 "Quicker than a Big Apple pol can say "pork," New York officials sue, challenging the line item veto's constitutionality. That suit, Clinton v. City of New York, goes all the way to the Supremes, which in 1998 put the kibosh on veto authority. The kicker? The guy who brought the suit and won--or, rather, the guy who helped stall one of the more powerful tools for reining in government spending--was none other than former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani."

 "The Supreme Court yesterday struck down President Clinton's line-item veto power in a ruling that preserved $ 1.2 billion in Medicaid funding for 89 hospitals in New York City. In a 6-to-3 ruling that the majority said was of 'profound importance' to the Constitution's separation of powers, the court ruled that the President must accept or veto a law passed by Congress in its entirety and cannot pick and choose among sections of the bill to curb pork-barrel spending." (Richard Sisk and Frank Lombardi, "City Gains 1.2B From Line-Item Veto Ax," [New York]

 "In a dissent joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, Justice Antonio Scalia said opponents of the veto had 'succeeded in faking out the Supreme Court.' He called the authority 'entirely in accord with the Constitution.'" (Richard Sisk and Frank Lombardi, "City Gains 1.2B From Line-Item Veto Ax," [New York] 
, 6/26/98)
 "Mayor Giuliani called the ruling a 'very, very big victory for New York City and for New York State' that would keep in place the federal Medicaid reimbursement formula for hospitals serving poor patients without insurance. 'Why the Clinton administration, that began on a note of wanting to give universal health care, ended up vetoing this particular area of legislation as a political matter, I will never understand,' Giuliani said."

 "For a classic example of the politics of self-interest, you can't beat New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's challenge to the line-item veto." (Editorial, "Rudy Gets It All Wrong," 
, 10/19/97)
 "This is no disinterested argument over constitutional principles. Giuliani wants his piece of the pie, and doesn't care who gets hurt in the process." (Editorial, "Rudy Gets It All Wrong," 
, 10/19/97)
 "The mayor is miffed because Clinton, in one of his first exercises of the veto, rejected a measure that would have confirmed the legality of a set of New York state taxes on hospitals and other health-care providers to help pay for Medicaid. ... It's a complicated issue that municipal, state and federal authorities should resolve among themselves - on the merits and in the proper setting." (Editorial, "Rudy Gets It All Wrong," 
, 10/19/97)
 "But to try to kill the line-item veto over this most parochial of issues is sheer money-grubbing insanity. New York has always been known for a grasping, devil-take-the-hindmost ethos. Giuliani does nothing to dispel that image." (Editorial, "Rudy Gets It All Wrong,"
