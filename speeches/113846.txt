"Four years ago at Hofstra University, President Obama promised to deliver a 'new direction' on debt. This is one promise the President unfortunately kept, amassing more debt than any other president in history. And a second Obama term is threatening to drive the debt even higher to a record $20 trillion. Americans simply can't afford four more years like the last four years. Mitt Romney will take immediate action to slash spending, cut the deficit, and end President Obama's era of big-government policies." — Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 OBAMA: "And we are now looking at a deficit of well over half a trillion dollars. So one of the things that I think we have to recognize is pursuing the same kinds of policies that we pursued over the last eight years is not going to bring down the deficit. ... We've got to take this in a new direction, that's what I propose as president." (Senator Barack Obama,

 "The Treasury Department said Friday the deficit for the 2012 budget year totaled $1.1 trillion. ... Barack Obama's presidency has now coincided with four straight $1 trillion-plus annual budget deficits — the first in history and an issue in an election campaign that ends in Nov. 6."

 "The latest posting by the Treasury Department shows the national debt has now increased $4 trillion on President Obama's watch. The debt was $10.626 trillion on the day Mr. Obama took office. The latest calculation from Treasury shows the debt has now hit $14.639 trillion. It's the most rapid increase in the debt under any U.S. president."

 "In a new paper, AEI's Matt Jensen looks at the real annual cost of servicing the debt for households at various levels of income — including a potentially higher tax burden. As the table below illustrates, a household making between $100,000 and $200,000 a year could find its tax liability higher by roughly $2,400 every year. Over ten years, that works out to $24,000. And when you add in the debt already accrued the past four years under President Obama (the second table), that's another $1,600 a year. So now we are now talking about $4,000 a year, $40,000 over ten years." (James Pethokoukis, "Study: Obama's Big Budget Deficits Could Mean A $4,000 A Year Middle-Class Tax Hike,"
