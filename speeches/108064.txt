AUSTIN — The Perry campaign today released a 30-second television advertisement entitled "Politically Correct," which will air on national cable and Iowa broadcast and cable.
Gov. Perry: "Washington is the capital of political correctness, where double speak reigns and the truth is frowned upon."
"You can't say that Congressmen becoming lobbyists is a form of legal corruption…"
"Or that we give aid money to countries who oppose America…"
"Or that Washington insiders are bankrupting social security…"
"You and I know it's true….but not politically correct."
"I'm Rick Perry, an outsider who will overhaul Washington and tell you the truth, and I approve this message."
