GEORGE HUMPHREY was a man of firm purpose, unremitting effort, and high dedication. His great contributions to American life--both in industry and Government--leave all of us in his debt. As I mourn the loss of a friend, I offer my most sincere condolences to his family. I know that they will be sustained in this time of grief by the realization that George Humphrey leaves an outstanding legacy of achievement and service.
