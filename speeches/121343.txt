As you can see, it's not just the fireworks, food and fun that complete a Fourth of July celebration. It's the togetherness of community, family, and people from all walks of life uniting as one.
No matter where you came from or who you are, today we are all Americans marching forward together for the love of our country.
Today we are all patriots.
Check out some photos and footage of Jeb as he joins the great people of New Hampshire for two Fourth of July parades.
Have a safe and happy Fourth of July, and may God continue to bless this great country and each American, from sea to shining sea.
