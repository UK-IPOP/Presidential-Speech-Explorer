Good (early) morning and Happy New Year from St. Croix. Pool is assembled and rolling toward an undisclosedÂ location for the first POTUS activity of 2023.
After holding outside the RON, pool joined the presidential motorcade for an uneventful drive into Christiansted. We came to a stop near Holy Cross Catholic Church at 9:04.
POTUS is attending mass.
Pool did not see him enter church.
POTUS emerged from church at 10:20 am local time wearing a blazer and a blue shirt with open collar and no tie, along with his aviators. He responded briefly to a shouted question about his New Year's resolutions. "Good year next year," he said. "Looking forward to it." He gave a thumbs up.
We are back rolling in the motorcade.
The White House called a lid at 10:40 am local.
Happy New Year everyone.
