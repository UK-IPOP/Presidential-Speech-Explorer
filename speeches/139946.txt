Pool Reports by

Greetings from Washington, where the skies are sunny and temperatures are expected to climb into the mid- to upper- 50s.

POTUS is at Camp David, and the White House has not indicated when he is coming back. But members of the pool have been tested for COVID-19, and we are now standing by. 


?The pool gathered at 10:05 a.m. and the motorcade is now rolling from the White House at 10:09 a.m. The destination is TBD. 


?The pool arrived after an uneventful drive at Lucia's restaurant at roughly 10:40 a.m. where it is now holding.

The White House has passed this along: "The President lifted from Camp David at 10:20am and landed at Trump National Golf Club at 10:47am." 


?The pool was back in the vans by about 1:25 p.m. and is on the move. It did not drive past the Trump National Golf Club on either arrival or departure.

The White House has passed this along: "The President lifted from Trump National Golf Club at 1:25pm and landed at Camp David at 1:52pm." 


?The pool was returned to the White House at about 2:10 p.m. and the White House called a travel/photo lid at 2:12 p.m.

I inquired about who POTUS golfed with and details about his schedule at Camp David. I'll pass along any updates.

Enjoy your Saturday.
