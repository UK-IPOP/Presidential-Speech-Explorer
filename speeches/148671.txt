On Earth Day, President Biden signed an Executive Order to expand his Administration's bold efforts to tackle the climate crisis, make our nation more resilient to extreme weather, and support local economies. America's forests are a key climate solution, absorbing huge amounts of carbon dioxide—much of which is stored in mature and old-growth forests on federal lands.
But with climate change making wildfires more frequent and ferocious, these forests are at risk. Building on the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law's directive to prioritize restoration of these forests, President Biden's Executive Order will safeguard mature and old-growth forests on federal lands, as part of a science-based approach to reduce wildfire risk. The Executive Order will also strengthen reforestation partnerships across the country, combat global deforestation, and advance nature-based solutions that reduce emissions and build resilience—all while creating good-paying jobs.
Ahead of the Executive Order signing in Seattle, Washington, 
 and 
 issued letters in support of safeguarding mature and old-growth forests on federal lands. The President's announcement received widespread praise from Members of Congress; state, Tribal, and local leaders; scientists and forest management experts; environmental, conservation, and outdoor recreation advocates; philanthropic institutions; and more.
 "Today's #EarthDay announcement from @POTUS is a win-win that helps protect our forests so they can continue to trap and hold planet-warming CO2, and at the same time ensures local economies that count on our forests and forest products can thrive." [

 "Climate change and wildfires are rapidly changing western landscapes and literally erasing some old forests off the map. Fortunately, there are science-based strategies to better prepare our nation's forests for future fires. In fire-prone landscapes, combinations of thinning, prescribed burning and revitalization of cultural burning practices with Tribal partners can foster greater resilience of old and mature forests to future drought and wildfires. I am pleased to see the Administration pursuing a science-based approach to restore our forests, particularly old and mature forests." [Statement, 4/21/22]
 "This is an essential call to our forest management agencies to become America's boots on the ground and leaders in fighting climate change. The President's action rightly recognizes the important values of mature and old-growth forests—clean water, recreation, carbon, wildlife habitat—and the critical role federal forests have to play in their protection." [Statement, 4/21/22]
 "This comprehensive inventory of old-growth and late-successional forests, across all of America's different forest types, will greatly advance our scientific understanding of these complex communities, and how best to ensure that they continue to provide their array of social, economic, cultural, and ecological services to communities across the country. Conserving and sustainably managing America's forests of all kinds is critical in their continuing absorb more than 10% of the nation's carbon emissions, whether it is protecting our temperate rainforests and their deep carbon-rich soils, or proactively restoring fire-prone forests so that they don't themselves become net sources of carbon emissions. This executive order reflects our latest scientific understanding of forests, and the importance of the entire spectrum of forest management--from intensively managed planted forests to forests managed especially for their ability to absorb and secure carbon--to enhancing the resilience of both natural and human communities." [Statement, 4/21/22]
 "US forests adapted to frequent-fire have become increasingly vulnerable to the effects of past fire suppression/exclusion and climate change. Our old-growth forests are some of the most susceptible ecosystems because most of them have been profoundly changed in the last century. Identifying where old-growth forests exist is important but simply drawing a line around them and saying they are protected is not possible in the 21st century. I am happy that the Administration is pursuing a science-based approach that includes Indigenous knowledge to restore and conserve our forests. Treatments such as prescribed fire and restoration thinning can be designed to incorporate local ecologies and in areas previously burned by large high-severity fire, novel reforestation techniques will be considered. There is a massive amount of work to do and it is time to get going." [Statement, 4/22/22]
"America's forests are already a climate action powerhouse, but they have potential to do even more. Our public lands can lead the way by showing how to conserve old growth and other high carbon forests in the face of climate change. This includes science-based management to increase the resilience of these forests to climate-fueled drought, pests and wildfire, and rapid reforestation of areas that have been lost using a climate-resilient mix of tree species planted with innovative approaches. This strong Executive Order directs exactly the science, planning, partnerships, and goal setting we need to maximize climate benefits from our national forests and other federal lands, and takes valuable steps to help facilitate climate-smart forestry across all of America's forests. This will benefit our economy right along with our environment, because caring for our forests generates 27 jobs for each million dollars invested. This Executive Order is especially notable for leaving no nature-based climate solution behind. This includes the direction to use urban trees as a natural defense for escalating extreme heat and air pollution driven by climate change. Treeless neighborhoods can be as much as 20 degrees hotter, putting lives at risk while increasing household energy bills and greenhouse gas emissions alike. Expanding urban tree cover to naturally cool and cleanse the air in lower income neighborhoods and communities of color that systemically lack trees across America's cities is a great step forward on the administration's Justice40 Initiative, and will help create green jobs in neighborhoods where needed most." [Statement, 4/21/22]
 "Old and mature forests are powerhouse carbon stores and a key natural solution to the climate crisis. They protect wildlife and are a source for the clean air and water we all rely on. This order is critical for better understanding the extent of our carbon-absorbing resources and ensuring that nature continues to serve as a foundational climate solution. The results of this inventory and other steps will help secure a future for these valuable places as part of the America the Beautiful initiative and its goal to conserve 30 percent of our lands and waters. Pairing this action with other essential climate investments will help to set the United States on a clear path to achieving our climate goals." [

 "This smart move by President Biden signals to the world that he's serious about protecting forests here at home and abroad. There's no carbon capture technology better than older forests and trees. For the sake of our climate and nature, it's time to stop logging these carbon storing champions on federal forests now. We don't have a moment to lose to secure permanent protection for mature and old growth forests and trees." [
, 4/22/22]
 "America's mature and old-growth forests are critical carbon sinks and biodiversity strongholds that provide essential habitat for hundreds of imperiled species across the country. We are encouraged by the President's executive order and hope it leads to vital habitat protections for recovering federally threatened and endangered species from the red-cockaded woodpecker of the Southeast to the marbled murrelet of the Pacific Northwest." [
, 4/22/22]
 "We applaud President Biden's commitment to protecting and restoring mature and old-growth forests and recognizing the value of forests as a climate solution. We urge this administration to move forward promptly with a simple rule to safeguard federal forests nationwide from logging and other threats as a central pillar of our national climate strategy. The United States can and should be an international leader in implementing forest protections as a remedy against the dual crises of climate change and biodiversity loss, and this is a major step toward safeguarding our federal forests here at home." [

"We welcome the president's Earth Day announcement. We have no time to lose when it comes to protecting our forests both in the United States and across the globe. Our global forests help mitigate climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it for decades or even centuries. And forests provide habitat for our wildlife and are a critical source of drinking water for our communities. This announcement is a critical step forward not only for the United States but for our role as an international leader in the fight against climate change." [
, 4/22/22]
 "We welcome President Biden's recognition of the critical role that old forests can play in addressing the climate and biodiversity crises and his commitment to protect these areas. Mature and old-growth forests store large amounts of carbon, provide clean drinking water for communities, and serve as essential habitat for many at-risk species. We are out of time to address the climate crisis, which is why we are counting on the Biden administration to move forward swiftly with a rule to safeguard these old forests from logging and other threats." [
, 4/22/22]
"Nature is one of our most potent allies in the fight against climate change and old growth trees can play an outsized role because of immense amounts of carbon they store. The president's executive order shows that the Biden Administration sees the forests for the trees — recognizing the crucial role that healthy forests play in bolstering resilience, naturally sequestering carbon, providing critical wildlife habitat, and purifying clean water. This inventory of old-growth trees and forest ecosystems will provide a strong foundation for the Biden Administration, forest managers, and communities to identify priorities for forest restoration and conservation, while reducing risks of massive megafires." [
, 4/22/22]
 "The country's mature forests and big trees need to stay put, and President Biden is recognizing that. They've accumulated enormous amounts of carbon and can store it for decades and centuries. We need to respect these 'elders' for their critical role in fighting the climate and biodiversity crises. This ultimately will mean keeping them in the forest. The day has long since passed when Americans relied on federal forests for wood, rural communities have largely transitioned away from using big trees, and the government should help with any remaining transition. President Biden's move to shift federal forest management is an essential step in fighting climate change. And we will be working to make sure federal agencies follow the President's lead to set a global gold standard on forest protection." [
, 4/22/22]
 "Our forests are both heroes and victims in the story of climate change. The carbon-storing power of trees makes them some of our best solutions for avoiding the worst impacts of climate change, but they are also in danger from the change that's already happening. Today's Executive Order is a clear recognition of the critical role forests play for our climate and our communities. This science-based, cooperative approach to forest conservation and restoration is a smart strategy we should accelerate and amplify." [Statement, 4/22/22]

 "Most Americans would be surprised to learn that the agencies who manage our federal public lands do not yet have a policy for protecting and restoring old growth forests or for ensuring that our forests are storing carbon to mitigate the climate and biodiversity crises. We applaud the administration for taking an important step today toward recognizing and protecting old growth and mature forests as climate assets. Forests are the original carbon capture technology–protecting old forests that have been sequestering and storing carbon for decades or centuries is a critical step to fight the climate crisis and reestablish U.S. leadership on climate issues. Federally owned forests, especially in the Southeast, have high potential to store more carbon while restoring majestic old growth, protecting biodiversity, and boosting local economies that rely on forest visitation. Taking stock of existing old growth and mature forests is an essential first step, but it's already obvious that we must end logging in our oldest, most carbon-dense, and most resilient publicly owned forests. We look forward to working with the administration to quickly develop policies to protect and restore old-growth forests on federal lands." [
