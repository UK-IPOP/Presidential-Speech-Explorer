 While Governor Romney is committed to lowering taxes, and as President will fight any proposed tax increase, he recognizes that all steps must be taken to prevent tax hikes. Congress should not be able to increase taxes on a political whim and with a simple majority.
 When Republicans took control of Congress in 1995, they enacted a House rule requiring a three-fifths vote to impose an income tax hike. After the Democrats took control in 2007, their first vote setting House rules rendered the three-fifths vote requirement ineffective. House Democrats now allow a simple majority vote to waive the three-fifths majority, making it easier to raise taxes and damage the economy.
 Lower taxes are a key to ensuring continued economic growth and job creation.
 Governor Romney believes making the Bush Tax Cuts permanent is the first step to ensuring that Americans are able to keep more of their hard-earned money.

 It is unfair to tax the American people three times: once when the earn it; second when they invest and receive income from those investments; and third when they die.
 We need to end tax penalties on savings and investments for middle class families.
 The United States has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world. We simply cannot afford for future economic growth to have a tax rate that is out of alignment with the other major economies of the world.
 As Governor of Massachusetts, he turned a $250 million retroactive capital gains tax increase into a $250 million refund, made the investment tax credit permanent, passed sales tax holidays, gave property tax breaks to seniors, and in each of his last three years in office, submitted a budget that cut the income tax.
