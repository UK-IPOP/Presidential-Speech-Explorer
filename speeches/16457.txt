THIS MORNING the Steel Industry Board has reported to me its unanimous findings and recommendations as to fair and equitable terms of settlement of the current labor disputes in the steel industry. The national interest requires that the United Steelworkers of America (CIO) and every employer involved in such labor disputes give the greatest weight and the most earnest consideration to the findings and recommendations of the three members of that Board as a basis for a prompt settlement of such disputes.
The parties to the labor disputes previously were requested to continue work and operations under the terms of the then existing collective bargaining agreements for a period of sixty days from July 16, 1949. This period will expire at 12:01 A.M. September 14, 1949. Obviously, additional time is required by all, including me, for study and consideration of the Board's findings and recommendations. The public interest in avoiding a stoppage of work and operations in vital segments of the steel industry, accordingly, makes it necessary for me to request at this time that the period for continued work and operations under the terms of such collective bargaining agreements be extended by both parties at least until September 25, 1949. I urge all parties in the steel industry labor disputes to cooperate with this request. During this extended period I shall expect the Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to make available to the parties every facility at his disposal in order to assist them in reaching agreement.
