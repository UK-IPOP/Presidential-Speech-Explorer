POTUS, as you know, is at Camp David. I reached out to the press office this morning, and asked for more detail on who he's with and what else he might be doing besides having meetings and foreign leader phone calls, as he told us yesterday on his way to Marine One. Will onpass if I learn anything.
CNN has reported that he's with a small group of aides, including chief of staff Mark Meadows and first daughter Ivanka Trump.
Enjoy this beautiful, sunny Saturday!
