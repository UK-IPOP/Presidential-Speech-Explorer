My dear Mrs. Carran:
I have your kind letter of September 18th. I am not going to be able to take the time to stop at West Branch on this trip, but I have asked Mr. Spangler to have you come to the train and accompany me to Des Moines in order that I may have an opportunity to see you again.
With kind regards, I am

Yours faithfully,
