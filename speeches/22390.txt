[ Released February 25, 1964. Dated February 24, 1964 ]
Mr. Meany:
You know from our conversation that the questions which have been raised by the International Longshoremen's Association and the Maritime Union, as reflected in the public statement of February 20, 1964, have my personal attention.
I understand that a satisfactory basis has been established for resolving these issues. To the extent that certain aspects of this problem continue to present difficulties, I suggest and urge that further meetings be held for the purpose of resolving these problems and that these be arranged under circumstances that permit free reason to prevail. The country will respect, and properly, only policies and procedures which are established in this way.
I trust I will have your concurrence and cooperation in this position.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Mr. George Meany, President, AFL-CIO, Americana Hotel, Miami, Fla.]
