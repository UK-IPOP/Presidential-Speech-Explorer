The President today declared a major disaster exists in the State of Nebraska and ordered Federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the area struck by severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding during the period of June 19-21, 2011.
Federal funding is available to state and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding in the counties of Buffalo, Chase, Dodge, Furnas, Hamilton, Hayes, Phelps, Polk, Red Willow, and York.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide.
W. Craig Fugate, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Michael L. Parker as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area.
FEMA said additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the state and warranted by the results of further damage assessments.
