 "It will be the first time that the state will spend federal abstinence education funds in Massachusetts for classroom programs.

 "Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., told Planned Parenthood Tuesday that sex education for kindergarteners, as long as it is 'age-appropriate,' is 'the right thing to do.' ...

 "'I remember Alan Keyes ... I remember him using this in his campaign against me,' Obama said in reference to the conservative firebrand who ran against him for the U.S. Senate in 2004. Sex education for kindergarteners had become an issue in his race against Keyes because of Obama's work on the issue as chairman of the health committee in the Illinois state Senate. '"Barack Obama supports teaching sex education to kindergarteners,"' said Obama mimicking Keyes' distinctive style of speech."
