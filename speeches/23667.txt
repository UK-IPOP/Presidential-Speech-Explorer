I WANT to present, with great pleasure, this trophy, which is significant of the great contributions which you have made to the American Merchant Marine.
I understand that your company is one of the largest dry cargo companies in the world, and that is a great asset to the American Merchant Marine.

Our commerce with the world, and our influence on the seas, are of course essential to us, so I want to congratulate you, and in congratulating you the members of your company, and also the American Legion for its interest.
