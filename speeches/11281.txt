, in this crucial hour of history, we, the American people, are especially aware of the heroic service of the Army of the United States, whose Citizen Soldiers have always stood ready to make any sacrifice required for Freedom;
, aroused by Axis treachery and repudiation of all the ideals of honor and truth and decency which as a Free Nation under God we cherish, we have taken steps to mobilize a Citizens' Army from every corner of the Nation and all walks of life and are preparing to achieve that victory upon which may be built a firm structure of peace and freedom;
 it is fitting that those of us who labor behind the lines to replenish the arsenal of democracy should firmly resolve to spare no effort which may contribute to the speedy creation of the arms and supplies indispensable to our Citizens' Army; and
 Senate Concurrent Resolution 5, 75th Congress, 1st session, agreed to by the House of Representatives on March 16, 1937 (50 Stat. 1108), provides:
"That April 6 of each year be recognized by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America as Army Day, and that the President of the United States be requested, as Commander In Chief, to order military units throughout the United States to assist civic bodies in appropriate celebration to such extent as he may deem advisable; to issue a proclamation each year declaring April 6 as Army Day, and in such proclamations to invite the Governors of the various States to issue Army Day proclamations: 
, That in the event April 6 falls on Sunday, the following Monday shall be recognized as Army Day";
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Monday, April 6, 1942, as Army Day, and I invite the Governors of the forty-eight States to issue Army Day proclamations; as Commander in Chief, I hereby authorize officers of military units wherever feasible to aid civic bodies in the appropriate observance of Army Day; and I most strongly urge that the people of the United States can best observe Army Day by honoring our Citizen Soldiers and giving special thought to the great responsibility for contributing unstintedly of their effort and of their means in order that our armed forces may be adequately equipped for victory.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 20th day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-two and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-sixth.
