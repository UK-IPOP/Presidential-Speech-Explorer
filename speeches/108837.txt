Mitt Romney today announced the support of 15 New Hampshire State Representatives. With today's endorsements, a total of 35 State Representatives have declared their support for Governor Romney.
"I am proud to have the support of these fiscally responsible New Hampshire state legislators," said Mitt Romney. "With their help, I look forward to defeating President Obama and getting Americans back to work."
"Governor Romney has the executive experience and the fiscally conservative values needed to create jobs and turn around our economy. He is a proven leader who can bring people together to confront the enormous challenges facing our county," said Assistant Majority Leader David Hess (R-Hooksett). "In 2012, Republicans must nominate a candidate who is capable of undoing the damage caused by President Obama's failed economic policies. That leader is Mitt Romney."
