Now that the GOP field is getting smaller every week, here's hoping that the party wakes up and rallies behind somebody who can win the general election. And who scares the Democrats more than anybody?
Marco Rubio.
It's not just his story that makes Marco Rubio such an attractive candidateâ€”although the story is something. (He's the son of Cuban immigrants who worked hard to give their kids the American Dream.) But his bearing, knowledge of foreign policy, reasoning, and thoughtful manner recommend him. Call it a presidential comportment.
Think about some of the things he said just in Little Rock the other day, and compare it to the other leading campaigns:
Free enterprise "is the only economic system in the world where you can make poor people richer and you don't have to make rich people poorer."
Democrats' "answer to everything is a tax. . . . But big government doesn't work and in fact big government hurts those who are trying to make it."
Not once did he call anybody a loser. Or have to apologize for a dirty campaign trick.
