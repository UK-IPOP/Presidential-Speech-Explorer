 — Presidential candidate U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, today announced the endorsements of 36 Texas State Representatives and five Texas State Senators. They join Texas Congressmen Randy Weber, Louie Gohmert, Michael Burgess, John Culberson, John Ratcliffe, and Brian Babin, totaling 47 Texas lawmaker endorsements for Cruz.
"I am thrilled to have these legislators' support," said Cruz. "They stand on principle and fight at every turn for the people of Texas. With their help, we will continue to grow our campaign and attract the thousands of supporters in the Lone Star State and across the country who want to see real change in Washington."
"Ted Cruz is truly a conservative leader and the kind of person we need in the White House," State Senator Konni Burton said. "He is a passionate defender of the Constitution and a critical voice for keeping our country safe and prosperous. He is the only candidate in the race who has consistently fought for the issues conservatives care about most and I am proud to endorse him for president."
"No one has fought harder to protect Americans from the disastrous policies of the Obama Administration than Ted Cruz," State Rep. Matt Krause said. "That's why I trust him to do what he says he will do and defend our conservative values. We can no longer afford to maintain the status quo and kowtow to the Washington Cartel. It's about time we had someone like Ted in the White House."
