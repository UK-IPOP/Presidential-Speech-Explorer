I WAS deeply shocked and grieved at the passing of General de Gaulle. This country knew General de Gaulle as a steadfast ally in war and a true friend in peace. Greatness knows no national boundaries, and therefore France's loss is the loss of mankind. The people of France and you, Mr. President, have the heartfelt sympathy of all Americans in your hour of mourning.
