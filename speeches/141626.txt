Pool Reports by 
, 
Good morning from Wilmington, where it is sunny and breezy. Pool was testing for COVID-19 this morning. We have a lunch lid until 1:30pm.
Pool has been called to gather ASAP.
One small correction to my previous report — "testing" should read "tested." Apologies.
I'll send an update with further details as soon as I have them.
Pool loaded into vans and was rolling as of 1:05pm. --
Pool transferred from vans into a bus down the street from the Biden residence. We are now holding.
?The van was swept and we joined the rest of the motorcade outside the Biden residence around 1:40pm. We are now rolling to an unknown location. --
?The motorcade pulled into Fieldstone golf club at 1:50pm. --
The press van pulled out of the golf course just before 2pm and we are apparently headed to a location where we will hold. The White House sends the following along—
The President is having lunch. No further details at this time.
?Pool pulled up to a strip mall with a Janssen's market. We are holding here. --
The press bus left the strip mall where we were holding at 2:50pm and arrived back at Fieldstone at 2:55pm.
?The motorcade is now rolling from the golf club as of 3:01pm. --
The motorcade came to a stop outside the Biden residence at 3:10pm. We're being swept here now. Your pooler has not seen POTUS yet today.
?The motorcade is rolling again at 4:00pm from the Biden residence. --
?The motorcade pulled up to St. Joseph on the Brandywine at 4:04pm. POTUS walked into the church wearing a brown jacket and a black face mask. --
?POTUS exited the church at 4:55pm. He fist-bumped another parishioner as he left and chatted with a few folks before getting into his SUV at 4:57pm. Motorcade is rolling. --
We pulled up outside the Biden residence at 5:04pm. Pooler did not see POTUS. We have a travel/photo lid.
Have a wonderful evening!
