My dear Mr. Levine:
I am glad to learn of the honor that you and your associates of the Bronx House Committee are paying to the Honorable Henry Morgenthan on the occasion of his seventy-fifth birthday, and I will be obliged if you will express to Mr. Morgenthau my hearty congratulations upon his anniversary and my warm appreciation of his many services in behalf of humanity and of high ideals.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
