I APPRECIATE very much you gentlemen coming here this morning.
I am very proud to be able to sign this valuable legislation.
Through the years Americans have been too busy making history to read it carefully or to record it, but we cannot steer a sure course to the future without a sure knowledge of the past. As has been said, people who do not know their past are doomed to repeat its mistakes.
The lessons of this century about our responsibilities at home and abroad are etched indelibly in our minds and in our memories, but it is vital and valuable for those who come after us that we preserve in orderly fashion those historic documents which recount this period and its lessons.
This bill will be a major step forward in assisting both public and private groups to preserve the records of our times.
I want to thank Congressman Brooks for suggesting that we come together today and to express appreciation to him and all those associated with the legislation for having rendered the future of our country a great service by helping to hold to our past.
