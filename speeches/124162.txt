"Lord, please protect and guide Mike , his family and staff. I pray that it would be in your will to open the eyes of believers in Iowa and throughout this nation that Mike is the one who will lead this nation back to You and Your sovereign grace. Bless him and protect him, while you guide him to become our President. In Jesus mighty name. Amen."
