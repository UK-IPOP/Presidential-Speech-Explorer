Dear Mr. Fuller:
Thank you very much for your telegram concerning the Presidential Preference Primary in New Hampshire. I am most grateful to those who signed the petitions in my behalf.
It is my understanding that, in your State, the Presidential Preference Primary is purely advisory and has no relationship to the election of delegates. My statement at my press conference last week was intended to explain that such primaries do not bind the delegates. Not only do I not object to such primaries, but I have long favored a nationwide Presidential primary, so that the voters could really choose their own candidates.
However, I had thought it would be better for my name not to appear on any ballot at this time as a candidate for President until I am ready to make an announcement as to whether I shall seek reelection. But the Chairman of the Democratic National Committee and many good Democrats in New Hampshire are of the opinion that my name should be left on the ballot. At their suggestion, therefore, I shall not ask you to take my name off the list.

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Honorable Enoch D. Fuller, Secretary of State, Concord, New Hampshire]
