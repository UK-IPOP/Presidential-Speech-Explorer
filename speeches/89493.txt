Hillary Clinton received the endorsements of Maryland House of Delegates Speaker Pro Tem Adrienne Jones and more than 40 Maryland officials and community leaders today.
"As one of eight women Speaker Pro Tems in the country, I am very excited to support Hillary Clinton for President of the United States and help her make history," Jones said. "However, I am even more excited about her vision for our country and her ability to lead from her first day in the White House."
"Hillary's experience is unmatched. From day one as President, she'll win friends for America and make progress for Maryland's working families," said State Senator and former U.S. Ambassador to Romania Jim Rosapepe.
Today's endorsers join Governor Martin O'Malley, Senator Barbara Mikulski and Congressman Dutch Ruppersberger in supporting Hillary, and illustrate her growing support in Maryland.
