The Administration supports S. 328.



Section 3(b) of S. 328 authorizes the Director of the National Park Service to collect and expend reasonable fees for additional services it may provide to the Monmouth County Vocational School District. Therefore, S. 328 would affect direct spending and receipts and is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimates of this bill are that its net PAYGO effect would be zero.
