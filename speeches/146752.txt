Rome, Italy
On the occasion of their visit to the Holy See, the President and the First Lady presented to His Holiness Pope Francis a historic chasuble in a custom frame with historic marble and White House wood.
This handwoven fiddleback chasuble was commissioned by Gammarelli of Rome in 1930 and has since been utilized by the Society of Jesus in the United States. It is a part of the archival collection of the Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Washington, DC, the oldest Roman Catholic church of the Archdiocese of Washington.
Holy Trinity Church is steeped in American history and has played a significant role in advocating for abolition, desegregation, and civil rights since its inception in 1787. President Abraham Lincoln visited the church; it served as a hospital by the U.S. Federal Government during the American Civil War; and President John F. Kennedy frequently worshiped there.
The chasuble was framed by artisans in Washington, DC and incorporates naturally-fallen wood from the White House grounds and white marble reclaimed from the original pulpit of Holy Trinity Church.
In addition to the chasuble presentation, a donation of winter clothing will be made by the White House to charities in the name of the Holy Father to commemorate the World Day of the Poor 
Rome, Italy
At 5:30 p.m., the POTUS motorcade departed Chigi Palace.
Rome, Italy
The POTUS motorcade arrived at the French embassy in Italy, or the Villa Bonaparte at 5:37 p.m. after another uneventful ride, with passers-by lined up along the streets.
Rome, Italy
The Beast pulled into the driveway of the Villa Bonaparte at about 5:42 p.m. POTUS exited and was greeted by an awaiting Macron.
The two leaders stood on steps and posed for the cameras with their arms around each other.
When asked whether he needed to apologize, POTUS responded "to whom?"
Follow up on whether he needs to apologize to Macron, POTUS responded: "We've already talked."
To whom?
Rome, Italy
The pool was ushered into the POTUS/Macron bilat at Villa Bonaparte at 5:47 p.m.
Macron spoke first in French, for about three minutes as POTUS listened. The two shook hands at the conclusion of Macron's remarks.
Then POTUS spoke. All quotes are rough, please check against transcript.
He said "we have no older" nor "more loyal" nor "decent" ally than France. He told a brief story about his father. POTUS then spoke of the "strong affection" for France and said he wanted to emphasize before the press that France is an "incredible, valued partner" to the United States. "France is value added no matter where it is."
On what happened between the two countries, POTUS said "the answer is — I think what happened was to use an English phrase … clumsy." He added "it was not done with a lot of grace."
POTUS emphasized that "France is an extremely extremely valued partner." He said "I was under the impression that France had been informed long before that the deal was not coming through."
Officials from both governments then started to yell at press to leave the bilat, and your pooler was briefly dragged out of the room as Reuters' Jeff Mason asked Macron a question and the French President was in the middle of responding.
Macron started to answer but press aides spoke over him. Mason had to shout "he is speaking!" so we could stay in the bilat as Macron finished his remarks.
"We clarified together what we had to clarify" Macron said in response to the question, which was if he was satisfied whether the relations with the United States had been repaired.
"Now what's important is to be sure that such a situation will not be possible for our future"
"This is an extremely important clarification."
Pool ushered out at about 5:53 p.m.
Thanks to AP's Josh Boak for this one:
Macron: "What really matters now is what we will do together in the coming weeks, the coming months, the coming years."
And a clarification: Villa Bonaparte is the French embassy to the Holy See.

Post-lid, a senior administration official gaggled with the pool for about 20 minutes about POTUS's meetings with Pope Francis and French President Emmanuel Macron. The SAO also previewed tomorrow's meeting with the E3 nations — Germany, France and the United Kingdom — on Iran.
ON THE POPE FRANCIS MEETING:
SAO noted that the Cardinal who was tending to the rest of the U.S. delegation exclaimed every eight to 10 minutes, after the first 30 minutes, that the length of the one-on-one was highly unusual.
The SAO declined to elaborate on to what extent abortion was discussed during the private meeting.
Climate was a topic discussed "at length" during the meeting between POTUS and pope Francis, the SAO said, in particular the $100 billion commitment that developed countries were making to developing countries. "The pope was also very focused on the impact of climate on the marginalized and disadvantaged communities of the world," the SAO said. The Pope urged POTUS to "accelerate our ambition" on climate.
On Covid-19, POTUS and pope Francis discussed what the developed world can do to help the rest of the world. The SAO said the Pope was "generally was driving the proposition that this is really an urgent situation and those countries with the capacity to donate more should donate more."
POTUS message on Covid was that the "US is actually trying to move heaven and earth from a production perspective, to get doses out the door as rapidly as possible."
There were two interpreters, one on the U.S. side and one on the Vatican side, in during the one on one meeting, but it's unclear how much they were relied upon.
"I think the word personal is really important in this regard. This was a policy meeting. It was also a personal meeting," SAO said.
On whether the two discussed Pope Francis visiting the us, the SAO said, "not that I know of."
The issue of migration came up in the context of climate change, and the impact it has in migration and refugees.
ON MACRON MEETING —
About 60 percent of the time at Villa Bonaparte was tête-à-tête, 40 percent with delegation. Some of the issues that were discussed include Russia, China, energy, and nuclear issues, and the SAO previewed parts of the readout that will be distributed formally by the White House soon. Neither side "didn't really make any asks" during the bilateral because "we had worked through over the course of the last few weeks a common agenda."
POTUS and Macron spent a "fair amount of time talking about the challenge posed by the rise of China," SAO said. The approach to China is "three dimensional," the SAO said: "the US strategy has elements that are adversarial elements that are competitive and elements that are cooperative. And the European approach is basically the same."
POTUS and Macron also did some coordination ahead of the Iran meeting tomorrow, and also discussed supply chain issues, domestic investment, steel and aluminum tariffs.
"It was a very meaty substantive but I would say broad ranging and strategic conversation," SAO said.
On the state of the U.S.-France relationship, SAO said: "we're moving forward."
"I believe we have done that. I don't worry at all about instability or drift in the us-France relationship." Activities of the last month gave the relationship a "jolt of energy."
"We had some hard conversations in September and October, I think the conversations heading into November will be exciting and engaging."
"There's not any sense that there's some kind of fundamental rift in the relationship, I think, at this point."
ON IRAN MEETING TOMORROW:
SAO stressed that "this is not a meeting for a deliverable."
SAO said: "I think there will be a statement out of the meeting which will send a good public signal, both E-3 plus one unity, but also it will frame up what we think the way forward is. But the main purpose for them getting together -- and this was actually a Merkel initiative --is we're at a critical moment and these four leaders have not actually had a chance to sit and talk about that. And they need to have private space to have a No BS conversation about where we're at and where we need to go. A lot of times, you have .. the meeting is fake, and then you have some deliverables. This is more like this is going to be a serious opportunity to check signals as we head into a really vital period on this issue."
