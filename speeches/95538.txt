 "Romney talked about reviving the auto industry, but McCain said some Michigan industries cannot be resurrected. 'I've got to give you some straight talk: Some of the jobs that have left the state of Michigan are not coming back,' he said. 'They are not. And I am sorry to tell you that.'"

 "'I'm aware of the economic difficulties here in the state of Michigan,' McCain said at a rally in Grand Rapids, just a few hours before Romney arrived." (Michael Levenson, "Staking Out The Next Battlegrounds,"

 "Like Mike Huckabee, who joked recently that he 'may not be the expert that some people are on foreign policy, but I did stay in a Holiday Inn Express last night,' McCain suggested to reporters Monday that American consumer culture offered a short cut to expertise. 'The issue of economics is not something I've understood as well as I should,' McCain said. 'I've got Greenspan's book.'" (Sasha Issenberg, "McCain: It's About The Economy,"

 "On a broader range of economic issues, though, Mr. McCain readily departs from Reaganomics. His philosophy is best described as a work in progress. He is refreshingly blunt when he tells me: 'I'm going to be honest: I know a lot less about economics than I do about military and foreign policy issues. I still need to be educated.'"

 "'I always thought someday I'd be in the car business,' Romney told the crowd in Grand Rapids yesterday. 'Well, now I think I could do more to help the car business and to help Michigan by becoming president than by going to a job in the car industry.'"

 "He'd change it, he says, by helping automakers develop new technologies and by finding ways to reduce health care costs. Romney gets the auto industry -- in fact, he's offered himself up to run an automaker if this politics thing doesn't work out. You can't say that about any other candidate in either party."

 "'I keep hearing this thing about why doesn't Detroit build cars that we want, and it drives me nuts,' he says. 'Detroit is making great cars. Look at the Mustang [he drives one]. The U.S. auto manufacturers are burdened in excess of $2,000 per vehicle in health care and retirement costs. They have to make a car that is competitive for $2,000 less, and that's not easy to do. They've done a remarkable job. They're really quite creative and able.'

 "'I grew up in the automobile industry,' the former Massachusetts governor and GOP presidential hopeful says. 'The biggest time of the year was the auto show at Cobo Hall. And I want to see the American automobile industry succeed. It pains me both as a Michigander by roots and also as an American to see our manufacturing base in the auto sector erode. I want that to change.'" (Nolan Finley, "Like His Dad, Mitt Romney's A Car Guy,"

 "'I've watched with concern as I've watched Michigan go through a one-state recession,' the former Massachusetts governor said, standing on a chair and yelling without a microphone. 'It's just not right, and we need to have somebody who cares very deeply about this state â€“ and I do.'" (Michael Levenson, "Staking Out The Next Battlegrounds,"

 GOV. MITT ROMNEY: "And I recognize that when Michigan is hurting, it is a precursor of what could happen to the entire country. Because our manufacturing base, if it's threatened there, it's threatened everywhere. 
. Michigan is a state going through a one-state recession." (Governor Mitt Romney, Remarks, 1/9/08)
 GOV. MITT ROMNEY: "It ain't working and you're going to find that that experiment is going to be rejected by the people of Michigan who want instead, somebody who knows, cares and loves that state and will fight very hard to help it come out of its one-state recession. I'll make a commitment: if I'm president, that one-state recession is over." (Governor Mitt Romney, Remarks, 1/9/08)
