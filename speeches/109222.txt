"Nearly four years after promising Floridians they would bring 'real change,' the Obama-Biden team is back in Florida today. But with a record of high unemployment, falling wages, and skyrocketing gas prices, voters won't be fooled by the same broken promises and empty rhetoric this time around. President Obama's campaign team says the American people will judge him on his record - and unfortunately for the President, they are right." -Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 OBAMA: "What we need is honest leadership and real change, and that's why I'm running for President of the United States. Now, more than ever, this campaign has to be about the problems facing the American people - because this is a moment of great uncertainty for America. The economic crisis we face is the worst since the Great Depression. ... At this rate, the question isn't just 'are you better off than you were four years ago?', it's 'are you better off than you were four weeks ago?'" (Sen. Barack Obama, 
, Miami, FL, 10/21/08)
 OBAMA: "We've lost more than 750,000 jobs this year - and we just learned that here in Florida, we lost nearly 11,000 jobs in September alone. Wages are lower than they've been in a decade, at a time when the cost of health care and college have never been higher." (Sen. Barack Obama,

 "If you lose your job in Florida, chances are you won't find another one any time soon. The Sunshine State has the highest rate of long-term unemployment in the nation. Some 53% of jobless Floridians were out of work for more than six months in 2011, according to Brookings' Hamilton Project, which crunched Census data."

 "The drop in Florida unemployment masks a troubling trend: The new jobs continue to pay far less than the ones that have been lost. The state added 114,000 jobs last year. But the bulk of them paid on average about 25 percent less than the jobs that disappeared, according to a Tampa Bay Times analysis of jobs and industry wage data."

 OBAMA: "It's getting harder and harder to make the mortgage, or fill up your gas tank, or even keep the electricity on at the end of the month. At this rate, the question isn't just 'are you better off than you were four years ago?', it's 'are you better off than you were four weeks ago?'" (Sen. Barack Obama,
