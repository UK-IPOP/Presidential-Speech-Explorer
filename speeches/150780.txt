Another two-minute warning

President Biden:
Good news before i head to Philadelphia. Next week i'll be reporting on SOTU. Today, i'm happy to report the state of our economy is strong. Half million jobs were created in month of January. We learned half million more jobs created last year than we thought so the December report is updated. 12 million jobs since i took office. that means we created more jobs in 2 years than any presidential term. As my dad used to say jobs are about more than a paycheck. 12 million more Americans get up every morning knowing they can provide for their families. Unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, lowest in 54 years. Last time it was that low was May of 1969. Black and hispanic unemployment at record lows. Inflation has now fallen for 6 straight months. Take home pay for workers is increasing. Wages have gone up. Couple that with 2.9% economic growth last quarter. strongest job growth in history. manufacturing rebounding.
While we may face setbacks along the way, our plan is working because of the grit and resolve of the American worker. We're lowering costs for prescription drugs, clean energy. We'll keep seeing shovels hitting the ground to rebuild our infrastructure. In communities across the country - we'll see a sense of pride coming back. Trickle down economics works for only one group of people.
The President addressed one question about whether he bears responsibility for inflation, responding that it was an issue before he took office.
Below is a partial transcript of President Biden's remarks from the South Court Auditorium this morning on the January jobs report and response to a question from the press:
President Biden addressed one question from the press: "Will you take any blame for inflation, Mr. President?"
President Biden responded:

Hello on this sunny, frigid afternoon! Hope you're all well. I'll be your out-of-town pooler today.
Marine One landed at Joint Base Andrews at 1:23 PM.

The President
2 minutes until POTUS remarks
POTUS spoke for 17 minutes. He finished at 3:32 PM.
Before he began, he brought on stage Nolan, the daughter of Jana Curtis, founder of Get the Lead Out Riverwards, and thanked her for making a difference for all Americans. Nolan was poisoned by lead at a young age.
Early in his remarks, POTUS celebrated the jobs report.
He then went on to talk about his plan for lead pipe removal and the jobs his administration said it would create. Here's some quotes:
"We've been needing this for a long time. This is not new."
POTUS said there were more than 24 million housing units that have problems with lead-based paint.
"No amount of lead in water is safe. None," he said.
He repeated the commitment to replace every lead-contaminated service line in the next decade.
POTUS and VP chatted and took selfies with attendees of the event for about 10 minutes after Biden's remarks.
A correction: the name of the girl POTUS thanked on stage is Nolyn Pace. The name provided previously was spelled "Nolan."
We're rolling at 4:07 PM to the Sheraton Philadelphia Hotel for the DNC reception.
After an uneventful ride, the motorcade arrived at the Sheraton at 4:18 PM.
Hello. Pool was brought into the muggy conference room that served as the setting for the DNC reception. Your pooler spotted Rep. Jim Clyburn, DNC senior adviser Cedric Richmond and Senator Chris Coons towards the right side of the room where the press was positioned. Senator John Fetterman stood at the back of the room.
DNC chair Jaime Harrison, Vice President Harris and President Biden entered the room at 4:45 PM. There were four American flags behind them positioned in front of a blue curtain. A railing separated them from the audience of more than 50.
Harrison thanked Harris for her tie breaking votes on the infrastructure package and other bills. He commended her for advocating for the removal of lead pipes and speaking at the funeral of Tyre Nichols.
"Vice President Kamala Harris is for the people and that's who she and President Biden are fighting for each day," Harrison said.
The VP started speaking at 4:46 PM. Her remarks were about eight minutes long.
She said she was asked recently what the one word to describe 2023 is. "Momentum," she said.
"We got a lot of finger pointing to do and by that I mean pointing at the results of the hard work," Ms. Harris said.
She listed the legislative achievements of the Biden administration.
She said Democrats believe "in the integrity and the purpose of our government to do the good work of the American people."
She said Americans now believe their government can produce results, even fixing roads and bridges. "Thats kind of basic but no one did it before President Biden," she said, prompting laughs and applause.
"I see the president at all hours, in all circumstances and I see what you all know, I'm sure, but don't see everyday. He works so hard," she said.
"I see him make some of the most difficult decisions anyone could be charged with making," she said.
President Biden then began his remarks at 4:54 PM. He spoke for about 21 minutes.
"It's good to be almost home," Biden said to laughs. The president's voice was noticeably more hoarse than when he gave remarks on the economy earlier on Friday. He coughed multiple times.
He mentioned his past fundraising success in Philadelphia.
"Jill is out in California campaigning and she told me last week, 'hope you don't mind but I'm going to the Eagles game," he said, referring to the First Lady attending the Super Bowl.
"Everyone here knows Philly. You are the most informed and obnoxious fans in the world," Biden said. "I'm a Philly fan too but I'm just not as obnoxious as she is."
"If I were not a fan of Philly sports, I'd be sleeping alone," the president said.
Biden said he was convinced to run after white supremacists marched into Charlottesville.
"The former president was asked and he said there were very good people on both sides," Biden said. Biden said he had no intention of running until that moment.
"You all came to this party in the same way. The way to rebuild the country is bottom up and middle out," he said.
"We're laying down a foundation because the world is changing, dramatically changing," he said.
He mentioned that he's traveled over 17,000 miles with Xi Jinping. He recalled Xi asking him to define America. Biden said he answered "possibilities."
Biden then looked at Rep. Clyburn. "Jim, I would not be standing here without you, pal. I would not be standing here without you."
Biden went on to talk about his legislative achievements. Referring to Harris, Biden thanked the "gentlelady from the great state of California" for her tie breaking votes.
"The great part about being vice president: every time you vote, you win," Biden said.
Biden said his administration has created 750,000 manufacturing jobs in America.
He then referred to an off the record meeting he once had with media commentators. He was asked what he would do if he could fix one thing in the nation, he said. He answered that he would cure cancer.
"I'm not saying we've done everything right. And I'm going to make more mistakes," Biden said.
Biden recalled his first G7 meeting as president. He told allies "America's back." Biden said President Macron of France turned to him and said "how long?"
He said Olaf Scholz, the chancellor of Germany, asked him, "what would you do, Mr. President, if in fact, we adjourned tonight, you woke up in the morning and found out the British Parliament was stormed" and the election was overruled and two police officers were killed?
"Think about that," Biden said.
Biden said allies are desperately looking for America's leadership.
"Jim, you know that," Biden said, looking at Rep. Clyburn. "And this is a guy who's helped me desperately in Africa."
"No matter who is president things are going to change radically in the next 15 years," Biden said. "And the question is are we going to be leading the pack or are we going to be the end of it?"
He went on to talk about "MAGA Republicans." He said there's still good Republicans left but also a handful of "MAGA Republicans."
"This ain't your father's Republican party," he said.
Biden referenced his meeting recently with McCarthy this week. He said he told him "the first thing you want to introduce will increase the debt by $1.2 trillion," he said. He said they want to eliminate the IRS.
"They want the poor and the middle class to pay everything," he said.
After remarks by the VP, President Biden walked on stage at 6:03 PM to chants of "four more years" and "go birds."
