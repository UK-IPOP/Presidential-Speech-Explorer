Call me crazy, but if @marcorubio loses FL and @JohnKasich wins OH, I see a possible route to Kasich to be last man standing against Trump
[In response to Roberts] I agree â€” it could be Kasich as last man standing
Starting to think CW that GOP needs to unite behind one non-Trump alternative to stop him from winning 1,237 delegates 
It's much easier to envision a two-front war in which Cruz siphons delegates from Trump in red zones, Kasich/Rubio in blue zones.
Path forward? Cruz, Rubio, Kasich fight the proportional states, focus attacks on Trump. Then a 1-day favorite son strategy for OH & FL 3/15
A huge Cruz win in TX. A Rubio win in FL. A Kasich win in OH. This would combine to probably keep Trump from 1,237.
 The good news for them: The combined delegate haul from Florida and Ohio (165) is bigger than Trump's overall delegate lead over his closest competition, Cruz (104 delegates).
The only way to stop Trump now might be to keep him from securing a majority of delegates before the convention in Cleveland.
The best way to do that is to keep Trump from winning the primary's biggest prizes. Cruz made sure Trump didn't sweep Texas. 
And Rubio needs to keep Trump from winning Florida that same day.
Some believe that the most realistic scenario for 
 Cruz managed thatTuesday; Rubio and Kasich face those tests March 15.
The number that matters most? It's not states won, but the 1,237 delegates needed to win the GOP nomination.
Of the 1,744 Republican delegates left on the board after Super Tuesday, 391 are in winner-take-all states.
