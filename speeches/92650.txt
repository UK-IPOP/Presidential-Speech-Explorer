The Clinton campaign today announced its Washington Steering Committee, made up of community leaders from across the state who will mobilize grassroots support for Hillary leading up to Washington's February 9th caucus.
"No one is better prepared to end the war in Iraq, move us towards energy independence and provide universal health care than Hillary Clinton," said King County Executive and Washington Co-Chair Ron Sims.
"Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to bring about the real change this country needs said," said former Washington Governor and State Co-Chair Gary Locke.
"We can't choose our President by looking in the rearview mirror. Hillary is the only candidate with the ability to bring the kind of change we need to our national energy policy and immediately begin repairing America's standing in the world the first day she is in office," said Congressman and Washington Co-Chair Jay Inslee.
The campaign has named legislative district directors in each of Washington's 49 legislative districts, who are actively building a volunteer network to support Hillary in the state's upcoming caucuses.
"I'm honored to have such strong support in Washington," Clinton said. "With the help of these community leaders, we'll bring our message of change across the state."
