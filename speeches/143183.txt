Pool Reports by

Good morning.

Just wanted to let you know that the pool was tested at call time for coronavirus and nothing of note has happened since then. No scheduling changes are expected, but I will keep you posted if anything does.

Best, 


Hi,

The White House announced a lunch lid until 2pm. 


?Judd Deere passes along the following call readout:

"Today, President Donald J. Trump spoke with Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc of Vietnam. The two leaders welcomed the 25th anniversary of diplomatic relations, and agreed that the United States-Vietnam Comprehensive Partnership is stronger than ever. President Trump raised concerns regarding the trade deficit and urged Prime Minister Phuc to take bold steps to ensure fair and reciprocal trade between the United States and Vietnam." 


?Pool has not seen the president in person today, but you have no doubt seen the pre-recorded, 4-minute video that he posted to his Twitter account "asking Congress" to amend the stimulus legislation and send him a "suitable bill, or else the next administration will have to deliver a COVID-relief package."

I've asked the White House for additional information. Will let you know if we receive further comment on his activities today. 


?The White House at 8:36 pm called a travel/photo lid for the day. Have a good rest of your evening, everyone.
