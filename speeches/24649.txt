IN EVERY community and on every level of American life, we seek a better education for our citizens. We want that education to fit the needs and meet the challenges of the 20th century. And we are coming closer to that goal. The program of insured loans to students now makes it possible for the middle-income family to spread the heavy costs of a college education over a longer, less burdensome period of time. It thus lends new strength to our national commitment of offering every child the fullest educational opportunity.
