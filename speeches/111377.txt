"President Obama hasn't found time for his Jobs Council in 200 days — but that hasn't stopped him from trying to save his own job. He's spent the last six months attending campaign fundraisers and pushing more liberal policies that will impede job creation. Meanwhile, we learned yesterday that the unemployment rate has climbed again to a five-month high. Mitt Romney's plan for a stronger middle class will get our economy moving in the right direction." —Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman

 OBAMA: "One of the things that's been striking about this Jobs Council is how focused and how hard-working everybody has been around this table.  This has not been a show council.  This has been a work council.  And because of the extraordinary commitments that each and every one of you have made, we have generated I think as good a set of proposals as we have seen coming out of the private sector to help to guide and steer our economic agenda and our approach to jobs and growth over the next couple of years."

 "The number of U.S. workers filing applications for jobless benefits rose last week, continuing an uneven pattern that suggests job creation was likely modest in July. Initial jobless claims, an indication of layoffs, increased by 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 365,000 in the week ended July 28, the Labor Department said Thursday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast 370,000 new applications for jobless benefits last week. Claims for the July 21 week were revised up to 357,000 from an initially reported 353,000." (Eric Morath and Sarah Portlock, "Jobless Claims Increase,"

 "Orders placed with U.S. factories unexpectedly declined in June, reflecting less demand for business equipment and the biggest decrease in bookings for non- durable goods in more than three years. The 0.5 percent drop in bookings followed a revised 0.5 percent increase in the prior month, the Commerce Department said today in Washington. The median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg News survey called for a 0.5 percent gain. June orders for durable goods climbed 1.3 percent, revised from the 1.6 percent surge reported last week. Demand for non-durable items, reported today for the first time, slumped 2 percent, the biggest drop since March 2009."
