CIRCULAR
DEPARTMENT OF STATE
SIR: The melancholy duty devolves upon me officially to apprise you of the assassination of the President at Ford's Theater, in this city, in the evening of the 14th instant. He died the next morning from the effects of the wound.
About the same time an attempt was made to assassinate the Secretary of State in his own house, where he was in bed suffering from the effects of the late accident. The attempt failed, but Mr. Seward was severely cut, on the face especially, it is supposed with a bowie knife. Mr. F W. Seward was felled by a blow or blows on the head, and for some time afterwards was apparently unconscious. Both the Secretary and Assistant Secretary are better, especially the former.
Andrew Johnson has formally entered upon the duties of President. I have been authorized temporarily to act as Secretary of State.
I am, sir, your obedient servant,
W. HUNTER,
