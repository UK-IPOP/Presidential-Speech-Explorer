My dear Mr. Warburg:
I have your communication setting forth the suggestion that April 13th next, being the birthday of Thomas Jefferson and a Sunday, should be especially marked by proper celebration of the founding of religious freedom. It would seem to me to be a fitting and inspiring undertaking.
As you suggest that I should appoint a committee to undertake such celebration, it is my thought that the Board of Governors of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation already comprises in its membership men and women of outstanding leadership in all directions of national thought, and that it would be desirable that they should undertake to bring the occasion to the attention of the American people and make such arrangements as would give it significance.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
