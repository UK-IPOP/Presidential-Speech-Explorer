 General Casimir Pulaski crossed the seas to offer his services to General Washington and to the young Republic in its hour of need; and
 General Pulaski organized the cavalry unit known as the Pulaski Legion, which he commanded with distinction until the day when he fell mortally wounded while leading a charge at Savannah; and
 he died from the wounds thus received on October 11, 1779; and
 Public Resolution 24, Seventy-fifth Congress, approved on April 13, 1937, provides:
That the President of the United States is authorized and directed to issue a proclamation calling upon officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all governmental buildings on October 11, 1937, and inviting the people of the United States to observe the day in schools and churches or other suitable places, with appropriate ceremonies in commemoration of the death of General Casimir Pulaski.
, President of the United States of America, do direct that the flag shall be displayed upon all Government buildings on October 11, 1937, as a mark of respect to the memory of General Casimir Pulaski, and do hereby invite the people of the United States to observe that day as General Pulaski Memorial Day and to participate with appropriate ceremonies in schools and churches or other suitable places in the solemn commemoration of General Pulaski's death on October 11, one hundred and fifty-eight years ago.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 18th day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-second.
