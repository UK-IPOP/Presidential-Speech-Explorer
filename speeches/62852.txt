 President Clinton, what's been the reception so far to what you have brought to these nations?
 So far, so good.
 No objections, sir?
 We've had three different conversations, of course, and this will be the fourth. And each of them—although leaders can characterize them for themselves—but I have been very pleased so far.
 Have they raised security issues with you, that they are worried that if there should be some kind of resurgence in Russia that they feel protected, or are they still worried about this?
 No one has said that they expect something like that in the near future. What no one knows is whether the future of Europe will be like its past or if it will be different.
 Are you saying that all have accepted the Partnership so far?
 You'll have to ask them when we do the press conference.
