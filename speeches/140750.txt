For decades, career politicians like Joe Biden ensured that America's trade policy centered around the needs of China, not the American workers. If Biden and Kamala Harris have their way, America would return to that failed status quo.



Harris was one of just 10 U.S. senators to 
 replacing NAFTA with President Trump's United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreementâ€”which leveled the playing field for American farmers and manufacturers. 
Harris also 
 President Trump's tough tariffs on China. 


Biden voted to give "most favored nation" trade status to China and voted to admit them into the World Trade Organization. These were terrible decisions that cost America 
and shut down tens of thousands of American factories.
Biden strongly supported the terrible NAFTA trade deal in 1993, which decimated 850,000 American jobs and sent them to Mexico. Biden has never apologized for his disastrous vote. 


: "We welcome the emergence of a prosperous, independent China on the world stage."
: "It is in our self-interest that China continues to prosper."
: "The idea that [China is] our competition, they're going to beat us, is bizarre."
: "China's not a problem."
: China is "not bad" and "not competition" for America. 
Despite seeing what Washington's decades of stupid trade policy have done to American workers, Biden and Harris have learned nothing.
