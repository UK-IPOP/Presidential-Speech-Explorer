Today, as President Biden remains focused on lowering costs for Americans, the Department of Energy 
 that will make light bulbs more energy efficient and save families money on their electricity bills. These rules are projected to save consumers nearly $3 billion a year while also reducing carbon emissions by 222 million metric tons over the next 30 yearsâ€”the equivalent of what 28 million homes emit in a year.
These rules are part of 100 energy efficiency actions the Biden Administration is completing this year, which together will save families $100 annually while advancing the President's climate goals.

Rules finalized by the Energy Department will require manufacturers to sell energy-efficient lightbulbs, accelerating a longtime industry practice to use compact fluorescent and LED bulbs that last 25 to 50 times longer than incandescent bulbs.

," Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said in a statement. "LEDs have become so inexpensive that there's no good reason for manufacturers to keep selling 19th-century technology that just isn't very good at turning electrical energy into light. These standards will finally phase out energy-wasting bulbs across the country."

Andrew deLaski, executive director of the nonprofit Appliance Standards Awareness Project, said some major retailers such as Ikea and Costco have already stopped selling incandescent lightbulbs. Others should be able to comply with the new rules more quickly than the government's timeline allows, he said. "These changes have definitely been a long time coming," deLaski said. "
