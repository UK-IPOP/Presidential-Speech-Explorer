Dear :
I am delighted to learn that you have agreed to serve as a member of the Committee on Education Beyond the High School, and I take pleasure in appointing you to that post. In augmenting public awareness of the increased need for educational facilities and in determining how better to assure that students will have those facilities available, you can through the work of this Committee perform a great service to the Nation.
Your deliberations will, I am confident, command the attention of every American and contribute significantly to a comprehensive and determined effort to meet our present and future educational needs. Only through such effort can we be sure of providing adequate educational facilities for the needs of tomorrow.
With best wishes for success in this undertaking,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
