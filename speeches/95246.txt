 Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced the support of nine additional Colorado Republican leaders. They join such Colorado Republican leaders as U.S. Senator Wayne Allard, former Governor Bill Owens and Attorney General John Suthers in supporting Governor Romney for President.
In making the announcement, Governor Romney said, "I am proud to have the support of so many strong Republican leaders in Colorado. Coloradans know that Washington is broken and we won't fix it by sending the same people back â€“ just to have them sit in different chairs. I want to go to Washington to lower taxes, end illegal immigration, strengthen our military, and restore trust in our elected leaders. With the help of these and other Colorado leaders, I hope to earn the support of as many voters as possible leading up to the February 5th caucuses."
