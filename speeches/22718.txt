 approximately a half-million young children are accidentally poisoned each year by common household products and medicines; and
 such accidents result in permanent damage-even death-to many of these children; and
 parents and others responsible for the care of children can prevent such accidents through proper storage, handling, and disposal of potentially toxic substances; and
, by a joint resolution approved September 26, 1961 (75 Stat. 681), the Congress requested the President to issue annually a proclamation designating the third week in March as National Poison Prevention Week:
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning March 17, 1963, as National Poison Prevention Week.
I direct the appropriate agencies of the Federal Government, and I invite State and local governments and organizations interested in child safety, to participate actively in programs intended to promote better protection against accidental poisonings.
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this sixth day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-seventh.

JOHN F. KENNEDY
By the President:

DEAN RUSK,
