Good Morning!
I'm pooling this coast-to-coast trip, less than a week from Election Day. The rest of the out-of-town pool and I are Covid tested and waiting for the president to arrive. We spotted what appeared to be a bald eagle flying nearby.
Today, we'll travel to Albuquerque for remarks on student debt relief and a rally – then off to San Diego for an event for Rep. Mike Levin. It's going to be a long one, and even though I'll flag them, please mind the two time changes!
Please also send me any questions or comments. Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre will gaggle mid-flight (streamable @ 
). In case you didn't see it, or want a reminder, I'm copying today's guidance below.
Enjoy the calm autumn weather in Washington while it lasts!
9:00 AM THE PRESIDENT receives the Presidential Daily Briefing
Marine 1 arrived at 10:46 am and the president exited a few minutes later. He's wearing a navy suit with sunglasses. Salutes outside the helicopter, before boarding the plane, and at the top of the staircase. The pool got a wave but no answers to shouted questions.
We're about to lift off, now taxiing at 10:55 am.
KJP stopped by to say hello just a moment ago, wearing a bright pink dress.

AF1 touched down at Kirkland Air Force Base in Albuquerque at 12:23 pm (now in MDT). After "moderate" turbulence on the descent your pool is now feeling queasy. It's cool and extremely windy on the ground.
The president exited at 12:41 pm and greeted the line of local politicians after shaking hands with military. Secretary Haaland followed in a colorful dress, waving to the pool. Clapping from the crowd, conversations with the POTUS, smiles and jokes. He took off his sunglasses soon after arriving and got into his car at 12:45 pm.
Motorcade is now driving.

Wearing a brown cardigan, KJP came back for a gaggle at 1:07 pm (EST) and finished around 1:33pm. She updated us on the trip and then spoke on US officials being able to visit Griner.
She took questions (long list here) on the Chicago wing of the trip, the why so many blue states, the chances of a recession, the accuracy of polls ("we are optimists"), jobs data expectations, student loan relief timelines, the president's democracy speech, support for Garcetti as ambassador to India, Democratic primary support for election denying Republicans, Twitter changes, the assassination attempt on Imran Khan, the Israeli election, and how the president will spend Election Day.
The pool arrived at Central New Mexico Community College at 1:00 pm. On the way we saw some folks taking cell phone videos and waving on the street. There was one truck parked with a "Let's Go Brandon" sticker across the bed and two big flags – one saying "F*** Biden."
The pool was ushered away from the front of the motorcade and didn't see the president exit his car.
We're now waiting in a small event space inside the colleges Student Resource Center. Soft jazz is playing.

The president began speaking at 1:55 pm after an introduction from a student, the NM congressional delegation (who touted Biden-era legislation, including the ARP), the college president, and Gov. Grisham – who discussed some of the state's efforts to make college more affordable. An alumna eligible for the student debt relief also opened with remarks.

The President
President Biden wrapped at 2:18 p.m. and as we exited he was greeting members of the crowd.
(check any quotes against the audio)
The president praised the NM politicians – Gov. Grisham is one of the best governor's in the country, he said, and their policies fit together "hand and glove." He spoke about student debt relief, how to access it, and the scope of those eligible in New Mexico. A couple times, he referenced the first lady's community college bona fides and that she's teaching today.
He blamed Republican members of Congress and Republican governors for their opposition to the relief, saying they in part stalled it. "Their outrage is simply wrong, and I might have to add on hypocritical." The president inveighed against "MAGA Republican" representatives who he says had loans forgiven but criticize student debt relief, including MTG and Vern Buchanan.
Later, he spoke about his former status as the "poorest man in Congress" and his late son's college debt. To close, he returned to his recent message that America faces an "inflection point."
Among other things, as he rounded up his admin's CV, he also referenced a comment he made on gun control to Gov. Grisham.
"I got an assault weapons ban once in Congress. We're going to do it again"
The motorcade began rolling at 2:27 pm. and arrived at Ted M Gallegos Community Center at 2:43 pm.
More cell phone video takers on the way here, including at one point a group of students near what appeared to be a school. A few protesters stood at the intersection outside – including two young girls in "Let's Go Brandon" t shirts. Some carried flags. One man had a graphic anti-abortion picture of what appeared to be a bloody fetus, with writing that this is what happens in "Joe Biden's America."
We're holding before the rally and didn't see the president enter the building.
Hello,
I am filling in for the print pooler for the next bit.
President Biden addressed an overflow crowd of about 100-150 outdoors ahead of the indoor rally. The crowd is standing on an outdoor basketball court adjacent to the indoor basketball court, where the rally is happening.
Onlookers ran toward the terrace loudly applauded when the president came out.
Biden stood on the terrace elevated above the crowd with New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. They held a mic when they spoke.
Biden said "this is not a referendum this is a choice." The remarks were not newsy and very brief.
Biden's remarks ran about 2 minutes.
The WH press pool was shuffled outside ahead of the remarks. We are back inside now.
Here is an otter link to the outdoor remarks: 
President Biden began speaking at 4:08 p.m.
Apologies for pasting the incorrect link before, which someone pointed out to me! Right one here:
The president finished speaking at 4:36 p.m. and stepped into the crowd for photos.
(as always check the audio for quotes)
He started by addressing economic issues, including gas prices, jobs, and the recent GDP report. He criticized oil companies for not drilling enough, in his estimation. Pillars of the administration's approach to economics on display: "We're exporting products we've made rather than jobs," to wit.
Then to the IRA's provisions on prescription drug prices and other administration medical care initiatives. "We've been trying this for 22 years – finally beat them [big pharma]."
The crowd applauded his comments on student debt forgiveness. "Say goodbye," he repeated. The president again criticized the same House Republicans mentioned at the previous event: "Who in the hell do they think they are?"
Then comments on lowering the deficit, on medicare/social security, and what he sees as a "reckless" and "irresponsible" Republican economic plan. Sens. Rick Scott and Ron Johnson he also mentioned specifically, harping on their views on social security and medicare.
To buoy Gov. Grisham, he mentioned abortion rights in the state – saying he wants to "codify Roe v. Wade." He also mentioned her record on guns (cue a second assault weapons comment), education, and public safety.
As the president discussed democracy, someone in the crowd shouted that former President Trump should be charged with treason.
Forgive the grainy photo below!

Driving now at 5:00 pm. Pool did not see the president board his vehicle. Back to the airport!
The president exited his vehicle at 5:18 pm and boarded AF1 shortly after a short conversation with the same commander as earlier in the day.
An uneventful ride, but a toddler was waving at the motorcade on the street.
We're taxiing for a liftoff now at 5:27 pm.

President Biden began speaking at 7:55 pm.
More than a thousand people are packed into the gym. The nation's flag hangs above the stage, with a crowd of supporters in front with signs. Pre-rally music included the Eagles' "Take it Easy," Tom Petty's "Won't Back Down," and Fleetwood Mac's "Don't Stop." All oldies today.
Before Rep. Levin took the stage earlier the crowd began chanting "vote for Mike" and "we love Mike." The biggest applause came when Rep. Levin said people don't want a second term for Donald Trump and that Congress should codify "a woman's right to choose."

President Biden finished speaking at 8:41 p.m.
(the usual disclaimer about audio and quotes here!)
He followed the form of other events today – lauding bills like the ARP, IRA, the gun bill, and the infrastructure act – and focusing on issues like medical care, the climate, student debt, and manufacturing.
After a shouted question from an audience member – perhaps in line with some of the Iranian freedom protests outside – the president made a mention that "we're going to free Iran" and that Iran would "free themselves pretty soon." It was very difficult to understand in house, though, so please listen for yourselves.
After speaking directly to a young member of the crowd who's sign he couldn't read because of the small print, the president started talking about his past stutter. "Sounds funny, but guess what: It makes you feel like an idiot." Soon after, he added: "It cannot define you. It will not define you." He connected that line of thought to the need for more "mental assistance" after the coronavirus pandemic.
The president spoke about the mental health challenges of veterans for the first time I can remember today, saying his administration is working on that with the VA. He referenced his late son Beau and the burn pits bill as well.
A redux of some of the day's usual digs at Republicans. There were boos after a reference to MTG. Mentioning the possibility he could be impeached by a Republican congress, the president joked "I don't know what in the hell they're going to impeach me for."
We're leaving now at 9:10 pm.
No sight of POTUS entering the motorcade.
We've got a lid at 9:43 pm.
Per co pooler Erin Logan the full quote on Iran was "Don't worry. We're gonna free Iran. They're gonna free themselves pretty soon."
She mentioned that a member of the pool told her, per photos, that the president's quote was prompted by audience members holding up "free Iran" signs on their phones.
