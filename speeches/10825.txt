A CONFERENCE has been called of the Members of some of the Senate and House committees who are available for the general purpose of securing unity of action in dealing with the many economic problems thrust upon us by the events in Europe. There being no conclusive action determined upon, there is nothing to give out at the present time. I have consulted and am continuing to consult with every group that can be helpful.
