Happy Sunday morning from the winter wonderland that is Wilmington. At 10:32 a.m., the POTUS motorcade was on the move, headed to an undisclosed location.
Wilmington, Del.
At 10:34 a.m., the motorcade arrived at St. Joseph on the Brandywine, the home parish for POTUS here in Delaware. Your pooler did not see POTUS enter the church.
Wilmington, Del.
A masked POTUS, carrying a piece of paper, left St. Joseph at 11:17 a.m. amid heavy falling snow, accompanied by one of his granddaughters (pooler was too far away to identify). He got into the Beast a minute later and we are rolling as of 11:19 a.m.
Earlier as POTUS arrived, two protesters were present at the church. One held a white sign that read: "JOE BIDEN EQUALS ABORTION EUTHANASIA AND INFANTICIDE"
Wilmington, Del.
The motorcade returned to POTUS's home at 11:25 a.m. â€” at the same time the White House called a lid.
Happy Super Bowl Sunday and please stay warm, y'all.
?The granddaughter accompanying POTUS earlier at church was Natalie Biden, per the White House.
