 Today Governor Rick Perry released the following statement on the anniversary of 9/11:
Fourteen years ago, our nation watched in shock as an unthinkable attack took the lives of thousands of innocent souls. And on that day, our nation banded together — stronger in the face of this heinous evil — and refused to back down. The strength of our bond, of the values of peace and freedom, lives on in America today, thanks to the sacrifice of those who risk it all in service to their fellow Americans, whether on the field of battle or as first responders here at home. Please join Anita and me in praying for every family that was forever changed by the attacks that happened fourteen years ago today.
