 – Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced 45 members of his Minnesota Statewide Steering Committee, led by previously announced State Co-Chairs Jack Meeks, Brian Sullivan, Evie Axdahl and Tony Sutton.
The Minnesota Statewide Steering Committee will play an instrumental role in building upon Governor Romney's grassroots campaign leading up to the February 5 caucuses.
"These Republican leaders from across Minnesota agree we need real conservative change in Washington," said Governor Romney. "Together, we will work to ensure our economy is strong and jobs are available for hard working families in Minnesota and across the country. I look forward to fighting in Washington to keep taxes low, cut wasteful government spending and keeping our nation a leader in the world."
Minnesota Romney for President Co-Chair Brian Sullivan said, "Governor Romney is the candidate with the experience and background to bring real change to Washington. Minnesota voters are looking for a candidate with the determination and the optimistic vision to grow job opportunities, keep us safe from terrorism and strengthen families here and across the nation. Governor Romney has accomplished this in the private sector, at the Winter Olympics and as a governor – now we need to send him to Washington."
