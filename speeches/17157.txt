THE PRESIDENT and the Secretary of State in their meeting today with the Legislative Leaders of both parties outlined the discussions at the Geneva Conference.
The President assured the leaders that no secret agreements had been made nor had any private papers been initialled during the Conference.
The President expressed the belief that the outstanding feature of the meeting was the apparently sincere desire expressed by the Soviet Delegation to discuss world problems in the future in an atmosphere of friendliness and a willingness to sit down together to work out differences. The President added that this, of course, is a hopeful development but quite naturally, does not, of itself, warrant any relaxation of the mutual security measures we and our allies of the free world are now pursuing.
The Secretary of State then gave a detailed presentation of the day-to-day discussions at the Geneva Conference and an analysis of the final agreed directive.
