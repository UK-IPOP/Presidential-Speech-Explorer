I WARMLY CONGRATULATE Chairman Russell and Chairman Vinson and their colleagues on the Defense Reorganization Bill. Except in relatively minor respects, the bill adequately meets every recommendation I submitted to the Congress on this subject. It is my conviction that the Armed Services Committees of both Houses have done a praiseworthy job on this important legislation, and that the result for America will be a more efficient and more economical national defense.
