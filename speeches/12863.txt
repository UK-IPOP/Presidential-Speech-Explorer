 pursuant to section 336 of Title III, Part II, of the Tariff Act of 1930 (46 Stat. 590, 701), the United States Tariff Commission has investigated the differences in costs of production of, and all other facts and conditions enumerated in said section with respect to, cotton cloth, being wholly or in part the growth or product of the United States and of and with respect to a like or similar article wholly or in part the growth or product of the principal competing country;
 in the course of said investigation a hearing was held, of which reasonable public notice was given and at which parties interested were given reasonable opportunity to be present, to produce evidence, and to be heard;
 the Commission has reported to the President the results of said investigation and its findings with respect to such differences in costs of production;
 the Commission has found it shown by said investigation that the principal competing country is Japan, and that the duties expressly fixed by statute do not equalize the differences in the costs of production of the domestic article and the like or similar foreign article when produced in said principal competing country, and has specified in its report the increases in the rates of duty expressly fixed by statute found by the Commission to be shown by said investigation to be necessary to equalize such differences; and
 in the judgment of the President such rates of duty are shown by such investigation of the Tariff Commission to be necessary to equalize such differences in costs of production:
, President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by sec. 336 (c), Title III, Part II of the said Act do hereby approve and proclaim increases in the rates of duty expressly fixed in Paragraph 904(b) of Title I of the said Act on cotton cloth, bleached, containing yams the average number of which exceeds number 30 but does not exceed number 50, from 13 per centum ad valorem and, in addition thereto, for each number, thirty-five one-hundredths of 1 per centum ad valorem, to 18½ per centum ad valorem and, in addition thereto, for each number, one-half of 1 per centum ad valorem; and increases in the rates of duty expressly fixed in Paragraph 904(c) of Title I of the said Act on cotton cloth, printed, dyed, or colored, containing yams the average number of which exceeds number 30 but does not exceed number 50, from 16 per centum ad valorem and, in addition thereto, for each number, thirty-five one-hundredths of 1 per centum ad valorem, to 22½ per centum ad valorem and, in addition thereto, for each number, one-half of 1 per centum ad valorem.
None of the foregoing increases in rates of duty shall be applied to any cotton cloth of a kind described in Paragraph 904(d) of Title I of the said Act.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 21st day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixtieth.
