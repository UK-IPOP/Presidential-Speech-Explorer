When asked 
 this morning what tax rate he pays, Donald Trump responded "it's none of your business." If his tax rate is none of our business, what else in his tax returns does Trump think is none of the voters' business? Donald Trump has repeatedly refused to release his tax returns because he claims he's under audit. Unfortunately for Trump, the 
 that excuse is bogus. It's time for Donald Trump to release his full tax returns and stop hiding the truth from voters.
"Our country has a long history of presidential candidates releasing their full tax returns and for good reason. Voters deserve to know what's in Donald Trump's returns - how exactly he makes his money and what he does with it. Enough is enough. We know he's done his best to avoid paying his fair share of taxes. What else is he hiding in those tax returns?" said Hillary for America Deputy Communications Director Christina Reynolds.
