 "We've seen layoffs, cutbacks."
 "When it's all said and done I'm making $200 a month."
 "I've been looking for a job for two years haven't found any."
 "I had to file my own personal bankruptcy and had to close my business."
 "Here I am. No healthcare and a slashed pension."
 "I just lost my job recently."
 "I have to work part-time in order to make ends meet."
 "Sometimes I feel like I'm a failure."
