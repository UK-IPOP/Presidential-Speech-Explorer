JOHN TYLER,
SIR: It has become our most painful duty to inform you that William Henry Harrison, late President of the United States, has departed this life.
This distressing event took place this day at the President's mansion, in this city, at thirty minutes before 1 in the morning.
We lose no time in dispatching the chief clerk in the State Department as a special messenger to bear you these melancholy tidings.
We have the honor to be, with the highest regard, your obedient servants,
DANIEL WEBSTER,
THOMAS EWING,
