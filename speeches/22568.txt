THE SENATE is to be commended on its passage today of the conference report on higher education. This Congress is well on its way to doing more for education than any since the Land Grant College Act was passed 100 years ago. Members of the House and Senate Education Committees, Republicans and Democrats alike, are to be congratulated on this major step forward.
I extend my special congratulations to Senator Morse and Congresswoman Green, who have a long record of interest and leadership in this field of higher education.
