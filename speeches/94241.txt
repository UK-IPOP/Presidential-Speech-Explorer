 [CNN post-debate analysis, 2/21/08]
 "Clinton's answer was a stronger performance; Obama seems like he's about ready to get out of here." [Politico, Ben Smith, 2/21/08]
 "Clinton just made an effective argument against John McCain: Though the Arizona senator is a champion against wasteful spending, Clinton pointed to his support for the Bush tax cuts and the war in Iraq - both colossal expenditures unpopular with most Democrats." [CNN Political Ticker, 2/21/08]
 "Did she potentially win this debate on points; I think so; it was close but she had a couple of VERY good moments on health care and the economy that probably scored well in the various focus groups of undecided voters watching this debate." [MSNBC First Read, 2/21/08]
 "So much of the time politicians just seem to be going through the motions when debating the issues. But the subject of health care always brings out a formidable passion and policy fluency in Hillary. People can call her a phony for all kinds of reasons but it's clear she really gets and cares about this stuff." [New Republic, The Stump, 2/21/08]
 [ABC News, Political Radar, 2/21/08]
 "Hillary Clinton just hit that closing response out of the park." [MyDD, 2/21/08]
