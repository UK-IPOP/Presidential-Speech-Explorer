Your Highness, Secretary Rusk, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen:
It would be hard for us to produce a colder day, or a warmer greeting. So welcome to America.
You are the first Amir of the State of Kuwait to visit our country. And you are the last visitor to the White House during my term as President of the United States. But there are, Your Highness, other statistics that interest us more than these. They describe the contributions Kuwait is making, not only to the welfare of its own people, but to the development of its neighbors. The Kuwait Fund has become a beacon of leadership in mutual assistance.
Since your state achieved its independence in 1961, it has assumed a mature and responsible role in regional affairs--a role of leadership that is far out of proportion to your size. Kuwait's generosity and leadership are a source of encouragement to all of us who believe that regional cooperation is an important key to world peace and progress.
For more than half a century, Americans have worked closely with the people of Kuwait. We are proud of these associations, and I know that your visit will be both a celebration and a strengthening of those ties.
I am told, Your Highness, that there are certain similarities between your state and mine--in both terrain and resources. In any event, I do know that your traditional Arabic words of greeting have meaning for Texans and Kuwaitis alike; you are, indeed, "among friends in open country."
I look forward to our conversations together. I know they will add much to the mutual respect and friendship which have bound our countries and our people for many years.
Thank you very much for coming. We are delighted that you are here.
