THE GROWING success of the Federal effort against racketeering and organized crime reported to me by the Attorney General should be a source of encouragement to citizens in all parts of the country.
This record is the result of exceptional dedication and efficient operation by the various Federal law enforcement agencies working together. No amount of recognition can compensate the men and women of the FBI, Bureau of Narcotics, Secret Service, Internal Revenue, Immigration Service, and the other Federal law enforcement agencies, for their long and unusual hours, extended periods away from home, and threats and physical danger to themselves and their families. Nonetheless, I am sure all Americans join me in expressing the Nation's gratitude to them--and their colleagues in State and local agencies.
At the same time, it should be recognized that the intensified Federal effort against organized crime stems in large part from the deep interest and leadership of the Attorney General. His efforts deserve our appreciation.
We can provide it in no better way than to take sober note of his conclusion that there is a very long way to go--that we not only have not won the battle against organized crime, but that we have only begun to conduct an effective fight and that each one of us can help.
For our part in the Federal Government, we intend to continue and to accelerate that fight.
