Dole/ Kemp '96 Deputy Press Secretary Christina Martin released the following statement today:
"The signing of today's minimum wage bill is a helpful, but small, step toward addressing the economic anxiety of American workers, Remember, a tax cut is a raise, and that is exactly what Bob Dole will give Americans. A 15% tax cut is a pay raise of more than $ 1,600 per year for the average American family. Fair tax cuts, a balanced budget, and spurred job growth will be the mainstays of a Dole Administration."
