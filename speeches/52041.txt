The Administration opposes provisions to remove the Social Security Administration (SSA) from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and establish it as an independent agency. There is no evidence to support the notion that an independent SSA will lead to improved performance. To the contrary, removing SSA from HHS would disrupt an integrated network of services presently in place and working well. Moreover, as the baby-boom generation ages, the need for coordinated services for the elderly will increase rather than decrease.

The Secretaries of HHS, the Treasury, and Labor, the Attorney General, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget advised Congress earlier this year that they would recommend a veto of an independent SSA bill, and urged removal of such provisions from the reconciliation bill.
