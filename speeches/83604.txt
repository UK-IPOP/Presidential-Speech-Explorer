 Mr. President, your reaction to the crowds and the towns?
 Very, very warm and very hospitable reaction. A lot of people coming out, for which I'm grateful.
 What did you get?
 Vanilla custard. It's highly recommended. I'm recommending vanilla for Hillman [G. Robert Hillman, Dallas Morning News].
 You are dripping. You need a napkin.
 I'm going to get one in a minute. Would you like some?
 No, thanks.
 I'm trying to get you a little national publicity.
 I think I've got all I need. [

 I enjoyed talking to you, girls. Enjoyed talking to you. Thank you. All right, let's go back to work.
 First a candy store and now ice cream, sir?
 I'm loading up, carbo-loading for the weekend. [
