 the destruction by fires in the United States involves an annual loss of life of 15,000 men, women and children, and over $250,-000,000 in buildings, foodstuffs and other created resources, and
 the need of the civilized world for American products to replace the ravages of the Great War is especially great at this time, and
 the present serious shortage of home and business structures makes the daily destruction of buildings by fire an especially serious matter, and
 a large percentage of the fires causing the annual American fire waste may be easily prevented by increased care and vigilance on the part of citizens:
 President of the United States, do urge upon the Governors of the various States to designate and set apart Saturday, October 9, 1920, as Fire Prevention Day, and to request the citizens of, their States to plan for that day such instructive and educational exercises as shall bring before the people the serious z and unhappy effects of the present unnecessary fire waste, and the need of their individual and collective efforts in conserving the natural and created resources of America.
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
 in the District of Columbia this seventh day of September, in the year of our Lord One Thousand Nine Hundred and Twenty and of the Independence of the United States, the One Hundred and Forty-fifth.
WOODROW WILSON
