UNTIL our streets are safe for every woman and every child, we cannot call ourselves a truly civilized nation.
Until we root out drug addiction, we cannot call ourselves a truly healthy nation.
Until we can sleep safely in our homes and work peacefully in our shops, we cannot call ourselves a truly law-abiding nation.
Until we can safeguard all our children from the perils of delinquency, we cannot call ourselves a truly progressive nation.
The cost of crime to our economy is nearly $30 billion a year--more than all of us together spend for medical care. This must and can be stopped.
I call upon every American, as I have today called upon the Congress, to join in a national, unified campaign to reverse the rising tide of crime in American life.
