Pool Reports by

Good morning. I'm your out-of-town print pool reporter today in St. Croix, where President Biden is leaving this afternoon after his holiday vacation.
It's a beautiful, sunny 81 degrees. Biden departs on AF1 at 1:45 pm AST.
There are no changes to his schedule.
President Biden's motorcade pulled out of the private residence where he's been staying in St. Croix at 12:50 pm AST.
President Biden and Dr. Jill Biden were riding in a black SUV.
The pool is now following the motorcade en route to the Henry E. Rohlsen Airport, where the Bidens will board Air Force One.
Rolling ….
The president and his motorcade arrived at the St. Croix airport at 1:20 after about a 30-minute drive.
The motorcade traveled through hilly, winding and often bumpy roads to get to the airport.
Hundreds of people along the route, scattered sporadically, took pictures and videos with their phones and waved to the president. One bar/restaurant called the Salt Great Pound was packed with people waving from its back porch.
Cars were blocked off on adjoining roads in the rural area to clear the way for the motorcade's airport arrival. A picturesque view of ocean was to our left for most of the trip.
President Biden — wearing a navy blazer, light blue shirt and no tie — and Jill Biden boarded AF1 with Natalie and Hunter Biden, Biden's grandchildren and children of Beau Biden, next to them.
The Bidens boarded at 1:33 pm.
The president gestured to the press when asked several shouted questions and appeared to say something that was inaudible. He saluted before entering the plane's door. He took no questions.
One of the questions shouted by your pooler was, "When will you have a decision on running in 24?"
Before boarding, the Bidens took several minutes shaking hands and exchanging pleasantries with police and other local law enforcement officials.

President Biden hugged his grandchildren goodbye before they walked different directions. Biden lifted up on Marine One at 4:23 pm en route to the White House.

Have a great evening!
