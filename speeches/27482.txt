THIS IS a very generous, thoughtful, and friendly thing for you to do to give me this invitation.
The Secretary of State talked to me, before leaving for the NATO meeting in Paris, about the possibility of accepting this invitation.
This is a very exciting project. I should like nothing better than to be able to be there some time in the spring. It is a little far distant to be firm.
A nation can be judged somewhat in its relations with other nations in the world by its relations with its neighbors. I am very proud of our relationship with Canada and the respect and affection which the American people have for your people.
I have just returned from a brief visit with a delightful friend, the President of Mexico. I hope that our Nation can always live at peace and friendship with our neighbors adjacent to our country.

I can think of nothing that would make me happier than for Mrs. Johnson to be able to join me in accepting your invitation. I shall certainly try to follow some kind of plan that will permit me to visit Canada in the days ahead, if you won't make me be too precise.

I just thank you for the honor.
