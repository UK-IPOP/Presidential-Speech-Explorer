I HAVE INVITED President Eduardo Frei of Chile to make an official visit to Washington on February 1 and 2. He has accepted, and arrangements are being worked out.
I look forward to this visit with special interest. During the past 2 years President Frei and I have communicated by letter on several occasions. The visit will give us the opportunity to talk further about issues affecting our respective countries, the hemisphere, and the world. I am particularly interested in learning more from President Frei about the achievements of his great experiment of revolution in freedom. Naturally, we will also review the future course of the Alliance for Progress in relation to preparation for the meeting of Presidents of the American Republics.
