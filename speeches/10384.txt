THE PRESIDENT said:
"I have signed the economy bill with but limited satisfaction.
"First, it falls far short of the economies proposed by the Cabinet and other executive officers of the Government; many items of their proposals, which were in turn recommended by committees on economy of the two Houses, failed of passage. Also the bill is so framed as to render abolition or consolidation of the most consequential commissions and bureaus impossible of consummation until some months after the next session of Congress.
"Second, it imposes unnecessary hardships on Government employees in minor matters of little consequence economically. Some of these hardships should be remedied at the next session of Congress. I believe we can administratively alleviate some of these difficulties and hardships. Every effort will be made to do so."
