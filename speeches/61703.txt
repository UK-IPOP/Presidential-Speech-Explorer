The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 3838. The bill moves in the direction of many goals supported by the Administration. It would:                              (1) consolidate homeless programs; (2)  reform Federal Housing Administration (FHA) programs; (3)  merge the section 8 certificate and voucher programs; (4)  provide performance incentives for public housing authorities; (5) authorize appropriations for Grants for Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities; (6) improve homeownership counseling; and (7) authorize appropriations for the Colonias Assistance program.

The Administration, however, is concerned about certain aspects of H.R. 3838 and will work with Congress to improve and strengthen the bill as it moves through the legislative process. A major concern with the bill is its effect on the deficit. OMB's preliminary estimate is that H.R. 3838 would increase the deficit by $243.5 million in FY 1994 and by $364.4 million during FYs 1994-1998. If these costs are not offset prior to the bill's enactment, they could contribute to a sequester of mandatory programs.

Among other improvements, the Administration will work to modify H.R. 3838 to:

In addition, the Administration opposes provisions that would: (1) impose restrictions on Section 8 owners under the merged certificate and voucher program, thereby limiting owner participation; (2) exempt the Government National Mortgage Association from HUD's overall personnel ceiling; (3) establish new statutory advisory commissions; and (4) restrict FHA's ability to dispose of its single-family properties for Homeownership.



H.R. 3838 would increase direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimates for this bill are presented in the table below. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from these estimates.
