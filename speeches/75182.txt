President Bush announced his strong support for the transfer of a second Perry-class frigate to the Government of Poland. The President will work with Congress to secure legislation authorizing the transfer, which would further enhance the interoperability of the Polish Navy with its NATO allies. With this announcement, the President underscores the commitment of the United States to work together with the government of Poland to reform and modernize Poland's armed forces.
In April 2000, Poland received a Perry-class frigate, the former USS Clark, from the United States. That frigate was commissioned into the Polish Navy as the ORP Pulaski last June. To enhance their seagoing capability of the Polish Navy, the Government of Poland had requested a second frigate. The U.S. Navy has identified a vessel that would be available as early as October 2002. Poland has stated its interest in participation in NATO exercises and possibly contributing to future operations.
