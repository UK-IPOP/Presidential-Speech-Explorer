 â€“ The U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will award nearly $1 billion from President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding to 85 airports across the country to improve terminals of all sizes. The grants expand capacity at our nation's airport terminals, increase energy efficiency, promote competition and provide greater accessibility for individuals with disabilities. Building better airport terminals will improve customer experiences, move goods through the economy more efficiently to lower prices and enhance U.S. competitiveness.
