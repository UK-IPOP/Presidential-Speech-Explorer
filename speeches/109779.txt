Verona, PA - Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney claims to be an "economic heavy-weight," but his healthcare policies are only weighing down the economy in his home state of Massachusetts. As we mark the two year anniversary of Obamacare, we are reminded that Romneycare, just like Obamacare, has dealt a knockout blow to our personal freedoms and delivered a serious jab to our economy.
"For Governor Romney to attack his opponents as economic light-weights is simply an attempt to distract the voters and the media from his economic policies that are still weighing down Massachusetts' economy," said Santorum. "Romneycare has saddled Massachusetts taxpayers with not just out of control government intrusion, but ballooning balance sheets at a time we need to put our nation's fiscal house in order."
Mitt Romney's health care overhaul "Romneycare" is an unaffordable burden for Massachusetts taxpayers and families:
"I am committed to righting the wrongs in our healthcare system," said Santorum. "But that does not start with a government-centric healthcare overhaul like Romneycare or Obamacare that do nothing but increase our deficit. I have been, am, and will be committed to reforming healthcare based on the patient's need and getting government's hands out of the most personal decisions any individual can make."
