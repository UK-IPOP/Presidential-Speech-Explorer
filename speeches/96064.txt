ARLINGTON, VA -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today released a new Spanish radio ad, entitled "Cuba Prisoners," which will run in Southern Florida. Please find below a transcript for the English translation of the ad and links to listen to the ad.
 
In August of 1959, the Castro regime imprisoned 24 year old Roberto Martin Perez. He was held as a political prisoner for 28 years, including 18 years in solitary confinement. In prison, he was cruelly tortured and shot six times. He was knows as a "plantado" -- a political prisoner who resisted the Castro regime's "rehabilitation program" by refusing to wear the uniforms of common prisoners and spent 22 years in their underwear. Since his exile from Cuba in 1988, he has dedicated his life to fighting for the freedom of the Cuban people.
