In response to Jeb Bush's trip to the border, Hillary For America Director of Hispanic Media, Jorge Silva, released the following statement:
 HANNITY: At one point you supported a path to citizenship. BUSH: Yes. HANNITY: You really – now you're saying a path to residency, no citizenship if you didn't respect our laws and sovereignty? BUSH: Yes. The plan that I proposed, and it's there for anybody that wants to read it. It's called "Immigration Wars." It's a book, you know, that I put out a couple years ago with Clint Bolick. The plan says you earn legal status. You get a provisional work permit. You don't receive government assistance. You pay a fine. You learn English. You don't receive any federal government assistance. And you work, you don't commit crimes. And over an extended period of time you earn legal status. You don't cut in front of someone who has been patiently waiting – HANNITY: Legal status but not citizenship. BUSH: Exactly. [Fox News, Hannity,

 "Jeb also, even when I pressed, left no daylight possible on a path to citizenship. No way. No how." [Jon Ralston (@RalstonReports),

 "Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush on Tuesday said he would overturn President Barack Obama's executive actions that limit deportations of some undocumented immigrants. Mr. Bush, who has been critical of Mr. Obama's use of executive authority, told radio host Michael Medved that he would repeal Mr. Obama's deferred action policies, known as DACA and DAPA. 'The DACA and DAPA? Yes I would [repeal them],' Mr. Bush said." [Wall Street Journal,

 HANNITY: "The top five agenda. If you become president, what are your top five priorities in the first 100 days?" JEB BUSH: "Undoing… (INAUDIBLE SHOUT FROM CROWD) Yes, right. Undoing the – by executive order, undoing what the president has done, you know, using authority he doesn't have." [CPAC, 2/27/15]
 "'If there's abuse, if people are bringing — pregnant women are coming in to have babies simply because they can do it, then there ought to be greater enforcement,' Bush said on Bill Bennett's conservative radio show, 'Morning in America' Wednesday. 'That's [the] legitimate side of this. Better enforcement so that you don't have these, you know, "anchor babies", as they're described, coming into the country.'" [Politico,
