My dear Mr. Postmaster General:
There seems to be general acceptance throughout the country that the Post office has been reducing its force in these times of difficulty when we are urging manufacturers to stagger their work in such fashion as to use all their employees. I know this is not true and that you are endeavoring to hold on to regular employees by at least giving them part-time work. I think, however, that it might be desirable to make some explanation on the subject.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[The Honorable, The Postmaster General, Washington, D.C.]
