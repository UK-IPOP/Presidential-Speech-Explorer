Dear Dr. Dewey:
I am interested to learn of the III Olympic Winter Games to be held at Lake Placid in 1932. The friendly rivalry of the athletes of the nations not only develops sportsmanship but also contributes to the advance of international good-will and fellowship.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
