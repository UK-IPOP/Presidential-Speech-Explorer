YOU WILL BE GLAD to know that I have secured a preliminary discussion amongst eastern mortgage concerns and governmental agencies upon the question of farm mortgages. As a result Mr. Henry Robinson, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Federal Reserve Banking and Industrial Committees, has arranged for a further meeting of members of those committees for the midwest districts together with representatives of mortgage agencies in Chicago at the Federal Reserve Bank in Chicago tomorrow. It is to be followed by a more extended meeting on Friday. In order that we may have full coordination of governmental agencies the Secretary of Agriculture and representatives of the Reconstruction Corporation and the Federal Farm Loan banks will participate in these meetings with other mortgage agencies. I am very hopeful that constructive steps will follow from these conferences.
