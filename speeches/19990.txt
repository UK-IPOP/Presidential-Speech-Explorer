President Garcia, Madam Garcia, and all members of the party that are accompanying you to this country today:
First, may I have the privilege of extending to you a very warm welcome from this government and from its people. In saying this, there is on my part far more of personal sentiment than would normally be the case.
As you may recall--from the years 1935, when the Philippines first became a commonwealth--and until the beginning of 1940, I served not only in your country, but as a subordinate on General MacArthur's staff. I served the Philippine government by assignment from this government. It was a very priceless privilege. It was an opportunity to learn something of your country, its people, its islands, its economy, its political formation. On top of that I formed many warm friendships that endure to this day.
I thought and I still believe Mr. Quezon was a great leader with a great vision. I still regret that he is not with us today to join with the people that are in this audience--to welcome you and to say he is glad to see the President of an independent Philippines coming over here to meet in the Capital City of our country so many of the people here that I hope he will find both interesting and possibly enjoyable.
Thank you for coming with us--to all members of your party--and greetings to your people through you.

Thank you.
