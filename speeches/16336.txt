Benjamin F. Fairless, President,

U.S. Steel Corporation.

Charles M. White, President,

Republic Steal Corporation.

Arthur B. Homer, President,

Bethlehem Steel Corporation.
In reply to your telegram of July 12 the present situation in the steel industry does not constitute such an immediate peril to the national health or safety as to authorize the appointment of a board of inquiry under section 206 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947.
Nevertheless, an interruption in steel production would have serious consequences to the whole Nation. It is obviously more sensible to attempt to prevent such an interruption before it starts than to wait and have the Government step in after a prolonged interruption has reached a point where it does imperil the national health or safety.
The board I am appointing will make recommendations as to fair and equitable terms of settlement. Those recommendations will not, of course, bind either party. Their purpose, instead, is to make it possible for the parties and the public to have the benefit of an impartial appraisal of the issues in dispute.
This is a proper and accepted method of aiding and maintaining industrial peace, and is in keeping with the American spirit of fair dealing.
Surely you are not afraid to have your side of this dispute examined in the public interest.
I trust that you will cooperate in presenting the full facts to the board I am appointing. Please reply.
HARRY S. TRUMAN
Frank Purnell, President,

Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company.

A. J. McFarland, President,

I hope these recommendations can form the basis for final agreement between the parties.
