"Upon satisfactory proof being given to the President, by the government of any foreign nation, that no discriminating duties of tonnage or imposts are imposed or levied in the ports of such nation upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States, or upon the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported in the same from the United States or from any foreign country, the President may issue his proclamation, declaring that the foreign discriminating duties of tonnage and impost within the United States are suspended and discontinued, so far as respects the vessels of such foreign nation, and the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported into the United States from such foreign nation, or from any other foreign country; the suspension to take effect from the time of such notification being given to the President, and to continue so long as the reciprocal exemption of vessels, belonging to citizens of the United States, and their cargoes, shall be continued, and no longer * * *";
 satisfactory proof was received by me from the Government of Guatemala on October 19, 1940, that no discriminating duties of tonnage or imposts are imposed or levied in the ports of Guatemala upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States, or upon the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported in such vessels, from the United States, or from any foreign country:
 President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the above-quoted statutory provisions, do hereby declare and proclaim that the foreign discriminating duties of tonnage and imposts within the United States are suspended and discontinued so far as respects the vessels of Guatemala and the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported in said vessels into the United States from Guatemala or from any other foreign country; the suspension to take effect from October 19, 1940, and to continue so long as the reciprocal exemption of vessels belonging to citizens of the United States and their cargoes shall be continued, and no longer.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 7th day of November in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-fifth.
