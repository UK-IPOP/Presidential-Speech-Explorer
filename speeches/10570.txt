I AM DISTRESSED by the news of the death of Marshal Joffre who is so affectionately remembered by the American people. Both in their name and personally I wish to express to Your Excellency the deep sorrow which is felt in this country at the passing of this great patriot.
HERBERT HOOVER
[His Excellency Monsieur Gaston Doumergue, President of the French Republic, Paris, France]
