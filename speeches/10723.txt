I SEND cordial greetings to the Boys Club of America, Inc., and my best wishes for a successful convention. Their work in helping prepare more than a quarter of a million boys for citizenship is a splendid service to our country and its success should inspire continued efforts in behalf of the eager youth of the Nation.
