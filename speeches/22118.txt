Ambassador Lodge has for the better portion of the last hour given me a complete fill-in and a report on the situation in Viet-Nam.
Ambassador Lodge is finishing his service as Ambassador there with this meeting. He has served with great distinction in that post and has earned the gratitude of the people not only of Viet-Nam, but the people of the United States. He has served without regard to partisanship, keeping the interest of his country foremost at all times.
I want to personally express my thanks to the Ambassador for the excellent cooperation that he has given two Presidents, and for the quality of his performance on a most difficult assignment. The Ambassador, for personal reasons, has tendered me his resignation, and I have accepted it, but his country in times of crisis will always look to him for leadership and for guidance.
Mr. Ambassador, we hate to see you leave, but we understand your reasons and we are thankful for the good job you have done.
