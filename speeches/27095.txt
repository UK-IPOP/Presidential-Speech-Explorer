STATEMENT CONCERNING REPORT ON THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS ASSISTED
These figures are dramatic evidence of the desire and ability of this country to help its young people attain their aspirations. The statistics suggest that in only one generation we can attain a once impossible goal: that every American boy and girl will have the opportunity to move up the educational ladder as far as individual desire and ability permit.
STATEMENT ON THE TALENT SEARCH PROGRAM
There is no telling how many thousands of young people, now and in the future, will be reached and rescued by this program. But we do know that thousands are in college right now as a result of it.
If every American would keep an eye out for the boy next door, or the girl down the road, more of our Nation's talent would be uncovered and developed.
