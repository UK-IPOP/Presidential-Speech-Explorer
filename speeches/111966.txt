Today, Romney for President released a new web video, "Not Even Half." President Obama has given billions of taxpayer dollars to companies that later failedâ€”including companies that were run by Democrat donors. This is just another example of President Obama's pattern of picking winners and losers and wasting taxpayer money.
: 
 "President Obama is spending your tax dollars to create jobs."
 "How's he doing?"
 You've heard of Solyndra."
 "They took $535 million in taxpayer loan guarantees and went bankrupt.
 "But that's not even half the story."
 "Obama's Department of Energy has handed out billions of dollars in loans and grants."
 "First Solar"
 "3 billion dollars in taxpayer-backed loan guarantees."
 "Now they're cutting jobs and their stock is near all-time lows."
 "ECOtality"
 "Received $126 million in taxpayer money."
 "Lost $45 million and currently under investigation."
 "SunPower"
 "More than a billion dollars in loan guarantees."
 "Lost half a billion last year. Laying off workers."
 "More than 16 billion dollars have gone to companies like Solyndra that are linked to big Obama and Democrat donors."
 "The Inspector General said contracts were steered to 'friends and family'"
 "Obama is giving taxpayer money to big donors."
 "And then watching them lose it."


 "Good for them. Bad for us."
