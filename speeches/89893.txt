When Hillary Clinton said she wanted to have a conversation with Americans, she really meant it. She's been visiting Americans in their local communities and has done live video conversations on the Internet, now she's taking it to a whole new level: text messaging Americans throughout the country.
Clinton's campaign is launching an innovative new initiative today to reach supporters across the country utilizing cell phone text messaging. Clinton's text messaging effort is focused on maximizing her efforts to communicate directly with supporters by giving them regular campaign updates, including information about the campaign and photos from events.
"By harnessing the power of text messaging, we can engage voters in the political process using the latest technology and provide personalized, local campaign updates to our supporters nationwide," Clinton said. "This is an exciting step forward that I hope will continue our conversation with voters in a new format."
 For supporters to join, they can simply text 'JOIN' to 77007. Hillary will first ask people to join at today's endorsement event in Albany where she will receive the support of Governor Eliot Spitzer, Lt. Governor David Paterson and all of New York's statewide officials. Voters can also sign up to join Hillary's network on the campaign website at

 Supporters will get regular updates from Hillary's campaign, including messages and photos that are personalized for their area. The campaign will also ask for voters' input and offer a feature allowing supporters to surf Hillary's website on their mobile phones.
