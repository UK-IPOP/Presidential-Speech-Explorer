Boston, MA – Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced the Romney for President Louisiana Statewide Steering Committee. This group of Republican leaders will be responsible for growing and organizing Governor Romney's strong grassroots support in The Bayou State.
In announcing the Louisiana Steering Committee, Governor Romney said, "Louisianans saw first hand how broken Washington really is, and they know – more than anyone – that it needs to be fixed. I have experience turning around businesses, the Olympics, and Massachusetts and I can't wait to get my hands on Washington. We need to cut taxes, cut wasteful government spending, end illegal immigration, and appoint strict constructionist judges to the bench. I appreciate the support of these well-respected Republican leaders, and with their help, I hope to earn the support Louisiana voters all across the state."
