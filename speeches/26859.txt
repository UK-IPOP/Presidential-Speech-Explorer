THE CEASE-FIRE vote of the Security Council opens a very hopeful path away from danger in the Middle East. It reflects responsible concern for peace on the part of all who voted for it. The United States has warmly supported this resolution. We hope the parties directly concerned will promptly act upon it. We believe that a cease-fire is the necessary "first step," in the words of the resolution itself--a first step toward what we all must hope will be a new time of settled peace and progress for all the peoples of the Middle East.
It is toward this end that we shall now strive.
