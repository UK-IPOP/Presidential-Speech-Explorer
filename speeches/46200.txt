The supplemental appropriations bill in its present form is unacceptable. The major objectionable features of the bill are:


— Language provisions that unnecessarily constrain the discretion of certain executive agencies to carry out their functions. Chief among these is the provision affecting repayment of Farmers Home Administration loans that could permit virtually any farm borrower not to repay his loan.

— A provision that makes funds appropriated for the "Economic Support Fund" for Israel, Egypt, and the Middle East Regional Program available for obligation only until September 30, 1986. This provision may restrict the President's ability to negotiate economic reform measures with the Government of Israel. These funds should be available "until expended" as requested by the President.
The Administration urges the House not to include funding for the unrequested water projects, to pass a bill that is free of unrequested discretionary spending increases, and to reject the unnecessary restrictive language.
