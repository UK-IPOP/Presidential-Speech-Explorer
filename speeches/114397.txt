"This was supposed to be a big week for President Obama. Instead, his nominating convention was embarrassed by a nasty floor fight, his acceptance speech fell flat, and for the 43rd straight month, unemployment came in over 8%. As President Obama limps into the weekend, it's certain that this is a week he'd rather forget." – Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
