— 
 EPA can operate an efficient, well-managed $5.3 billion program that protects human health through an aggressive emergency cleanup program and makes significant progress toward addressing the long-term hazardous waste cleanup problem.

— 
 Such litigation would be extremely costly, impose huge burdens on the courts, and result in program priorities being set by a variety of different courts, none of which could consider the entire program but, all of which would have to respond to pressure for individual action. This provision is especially objectionable in combination with the mandatory cleanup deadlines for Federal facilities; and

 (i.e., cleaning up abandoned hazardous waste sites).

— 
 The legislation should provide adequate revenue from taxes on industries associated with the hazardous waste problems Superfund is used to clean up. The broad-based tax runs counter to this "polluter pays" concept. Further, S. 51's value added tax would be very costly and complex to administer;
The President's senior advisors will recommend disapproval of any legislation containing a value-added or other broad-based tax.
