 "I think the difference is -- and now again, I don't want to speak for her or her bill -- my understanding is that she calls for a cap on troops levels but does not begin a phased redeployment. And so that's a pretty substantial difference." [Barack Obama, 2/12/07]

 "And thirdly, we do need to begin, I had hoped by the end of this year, a phased redeployment.

 "I continue to urge a strategy that places pressure on the Iraqi government to resolve the political crisis through phased redeployment of U.S. troops, establishes an Iraqi Oil Trust to end the stalemate over oil, and pursues an aggressive diplomatic strategy including an international conference of the regional parties to further the task of Iraq's stability." [Statement, 1/10/07]

 "In Iraq, the prescription is the opposite. Rather than an escalation of U.S. troops, which I do not believe will contribute to long-term success in Iraq, we should be beginning a phased redeployment of U.S. troops as a way to put pressure on the Iraqi government to take responsibility for its own security and future." [Press Conference, 1/17/07]
