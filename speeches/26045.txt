WITH DEEP REGRET I have accepted and concur in the request of Mr. Justice Fortas and am withdrawing his nomination as Chief Justice of the United States. I believed when I made this nomination, and I believe now, that he is the best qualified man for this high position. The action of the Senate, a body I revere and to which I devoted a dozen years of my life, is historically and constitutionally tragic.
I urge all involved with and concerned about our Constitution and its form of government to pledge now that this shall be no precedent, that the Senate hereafter will act by majority will and never fail to address itself to the issues which it has the constitutional duty to answer.
