THE PALESTINE problem has been, and is, the deep concern of this Government. It has been given the most careful consideration by me, the Cabinet, and other responsible Government officials. The U.S. position has been developed through long and exhaustive study and many consultations. This position has been accurately presented by Ambassador Austin in his speech before the Security Council today.
