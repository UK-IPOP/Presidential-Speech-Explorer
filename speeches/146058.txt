 "From his very first days in office, President Biden demonstrated a commitment to helping the AANHPI community, taking action to address hate crimes and creating a new White House senior advisor position for AANHPI issues. Now, with the official launch of the White House Initiative on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders (WHIAANHPI), he is fulfilling one more promise to ensure more access to federal resources for these communities. First established by President Clinton, this initiative has helped elevate AANHPI issues throughout the federal government, and now I'm proud to see it expanding under President Biden to focus on health equity and pandemic response, two areas where AANHPIs are disproportionately at risk. I am pleased to see the Initiative re-establishing their federal interagency working group and their regional network to ensure that our communities all across the country see their voices and needs reflected throughout our federal government. Today's announcement is a reaffirmation of the President and Vice President's dedication towards solving issues that impact the AANHPI community, and I look forward to our future collaborations. I am also thrilled to congratulate U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai on her appointment as co-chair of WHIAANHPI. She and Secretary Becerra are very well aware of our communities' needs and have the experience and knowledge necessary to chair this Initiative. Finally, I proudly congratulate Krystal Ka'ai, former CAPAC Executive Director, on her role as the Executive Director of WHIAANHPI, where I know she will continue to elevate the AANHPI community and ensure our needs are heard and understood at the highest levels of government."

 "The Biden Administration's move to establish the White House Initiative on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders (WHIAANHPI) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is extremely important for the territories as we battle the COVID-19 pandemic. I look forward to working with WHIAANHPI co-Chair HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra and incoming co-Chair U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Katherine Tai whose role may help to address the challenges facing trade and transportation in the Northern Mariana Islands (NMI). The initiative's newly established federal Interagency Working Group and Regional Network may be instrumental in moving the NMI's agenda forward through a whole of government approach. As I've experienced over the years, this is an effective approach when addressing policy issues, program development and ensuring access to critical federal resources that benefit our community; in this case Asian Americans and native Pacific Islanders living in the commonwealth." [Statement. 12/9/21]

The appointment of Hawai?i natives, Krystal Ka?ai and Erika Moritsugu to key White House positions and the administration's decision to change the name of the Initiative to explicitly include Native Hawaiians is testament to President Biden's promise to elevate the voices of our most underrepresented communities.

Now, you are ensuring a national voice for all AAPIs," said Senator Richard Pan (D-Sacramento) and Assemblymember Evan Low (D-Silicon Valley). "California is home to over six million AAPIs and has one of the largest AAPI Legislative delegations in the nation.

It is critical that we invest in AAPI policy advocacy at the highest level." [Statement, 12/9/21]

"Today, we are excited by the official launch of the White House Initiative on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders (WHIAANHPI) under the Biden Administration. Since its creation during the Clinton Administration in 1999, WHAANHPI has been one of the most important platforms our communities have to ensure the needs of our communities are heard throughout the halls of the federal government, as well as to encourage AANHPIs to become civically engaged and get involved in public service. We are pleased WHIAANHPI is expanding to explicitly include Native Hawaiians, and that it re-establishes the interagency working group and regional network to ensure federal agencies work more effectively to serve the AANHPI community."

TAAF applauds HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra and Ambassador Katherine Tai, who we believe will do an exceptional job of leading his Initiative and driving necessary investments in our communities.

Ambassador Tai is one of the highest ranking Asian American officials in the Biden Administration and the first woman of color to serve as the U.S. Trade Representative. Throughout his career, Secretary Becerra has been a longtime champion for AA and NHPI communities.

"Our business community continues to face many challenges. AANHPI small business owners have battled both COVID-19 and a sharp spike in discrimination and violence. The relaunch of WHIAANHPI will play a significant role in protecting our community, allowing our small businesses to operate safely, and creating prosperity. Too often, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, and Native Hawaiians are seen as a monolith. WHIAANHPI's commitment to disaggregate data on AANHPIs will reveal the unmet needs of our community so we can find solutions. National ACE looks forward to working with WHIAANHPI to advance solutions that will help our economy move forward." [

"AAPCHO applauds the Biden administration for formally launching WHIAANHPI within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

New and longstanding inequities in health, data disaggregation, language access, racial bias and discrimination, and other social determinants continue to challenge Asian Americans (AAs), Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders (NH/PIs), requiring persistent and coordinated action across government. Community health centers and other community based organizations are important community leaders in addressing these disparities, and we encourage WHIAANHPI and its regional network to ensure strong and inclusive dialogue and engagement with them. AAPCHO and our member community health centers look forward to working with Secretary Becerra, Ambassador Tai, and Executive Director Ka'ai on behalf of AAs and NH/PIs across the nation."

We welcome the addition of Ambassador Katherine Tai as co-chair of the initiative and look forward to her leadership with co-Chair Secretary Becerra and Executive Director Krystal Ka'ai. JACL has valued our longstanding relationship with Secretary Becerra since his leadership in the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC) and with Ms. Ka'ai when she served as executive director for CAPAC and look forward to continued collaboration.
