THE NEW organization results from our concern over the high rate of crime among previous offenders and our determination to do something about it.
Of 12,200 persons committed to Federal prisons last year, nearly 8,000 had served previous sentences in State or Federal prisons. We can say from these figures that any advance in correctional procedures that reduces the number of criminal repeaters will make a sizable reduction in the crime rate in general.
