 a joint resolution of the Congress approved May 18, 1928 (45 Stat. 617), authorizes and requests the President of the United States to issue annually a proclamation setting apart May 1 as Child Health Day; and
 child health is of vital concern to the Nation:
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the first day of May of this year as Child Health Day.
And I hereby call the people of the United States to the peaceful task of considering whether the children in their families and in each community are receiving the full benefit of our knowledge of how to promote the health of mothers and babies at the time of birth and of children throughout the period of growth and development, and ask them to plan how the child-health work of our public and private agencies can be extended and made more effective. I also call upon the children to celebrate the gains they have made during the year in health and strength and to do their part in the year-round effort to promote the health of the Nation.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 4th day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-second.
FRANKLIN D ROOSEVELT
By the President:
