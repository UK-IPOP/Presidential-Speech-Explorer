 on November 11, 1918, the nations then at war laid down their weapons and turned their thoughts to the hoped-for dawn of an era of peace and order; and
 Senate Concurrent Resolution 18, Sixty-ninth Congress, passed June 4, 1926 (44 Stat. 1982), requests the President of the United States to issue a proclamation calling for the display of the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on November 11 and for the observance of the day with appropriate ceremonies, and the act of May 13, 1938 (52 Stat. 351) designates the 11th day of November of each year as a legal public holiday; and
 observance of the anniversary of the armistice of 1918 will direct our minds to the need of the world then as now not only for peace but also for peace with understanding, not only for a cessation of hostilities but also for mutual respect in the intercourse between nations:
 President of the United States of America, do hereby direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings on November 11, 1940, and I call upon the people of the United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies in schools and churches, or other suitable places.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
at the City of Washington this 17th day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-flfth.
FRANKLIN D ROOSEVELT
