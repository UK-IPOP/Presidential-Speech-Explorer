[Released October 27, 1931. Dated October 15, 1931]
Dear Mr. Walsh:
I have your letter of October 14th. I think you will realize that I should not personally conduct the negotiations to which you refer inasmuch as they properly lie in the province of the Department of State, which has responsibility for the handling of our foreign affairs.
Your letter is one therefore which should properly come up for discussion with the Department of State.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Frank P. Walsh, Chairman, The Power Authority of the State of New York, 80 Center Street, New York City]
