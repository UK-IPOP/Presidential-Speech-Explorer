The Administration strongly supports the termination of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), and has proposed legislation (H.R. 1436) for this purpose. Eliminating those elements of economic regulation that no longer enhance productivity and competitiveness is a primary Administration priority. However, renaming the ICC and moving its most burdensome regulatory elements to a new Federal entity, as H.R. 2539 would do, accomplishes no genuine deregulation. If H.R. 2539 were presented to the President in the form reported by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, the Secretaries of Transportation and Labor would recommend that it be vetoed.

The Administration wants to work with Congress to craft legislation that truly abolishes the ICC and substantially reduces the regulatory burdens currently imposed on the transportation industry and the economy as a whole. Accordingly, the Administration urges that the bill be amended to:

The Administration supports provisions in H.R. 2539 that would reduce tariff filing requirements, reduce the basis (or shipper under-charge complaints, and provide relief from some unnecessary regulatory requirements.



H.R. 2539 would affect direct spending and receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary estimate is the changes in both receipts and outlays would be less than $500,000 a year. This estimate is subject to change.
