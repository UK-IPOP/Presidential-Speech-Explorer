The frontrunner in the Republican primary refuses to answer a single policy question.

Finally, last night he actually took a position and said, alright, I've changed my opinion on temporary guest workers â€” high-tech workers.

And as soon as the debate ended and his handlers got ahold of him, within seconds he reversed his position back. It's just unreal.
When is the last time you've ever seen a frontrunner who's performed the way he has . . . and we're still being asked will you support him if he's the nominee?

That question would never come up if anyone else was the frontrunner. 65 percent of Republican voters do not want him to be our nominee; he can never unite our party.

It really puts us in a tough position, and that's why I'm asking everyone to unite behind our campaign, we're the only one that can bring us together.
