Since President Biden took office, there has been historic job growth â€“ nearly 5 million new jobs, the most in any President's first eight months on record. The average number of new unemployment insurance claims has been cut by more than 60 percent and small business optimism has returned to its pre-pandemic levels. Independent projections from the CBO, the IMF, the Federal Reserve, the World Bank, the OECD, and many others all forecast America this year reaching the highest levels of growth in decades thanks to the President's success in getting economic relief to the middle-class and curbing the pandemic.
