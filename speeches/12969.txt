 by the War for American Independence there was established in this land a broader freedom than the world had ever known before; and
 it is fitting that we should hold ever in honor the heroes of that War in order that the American youth of today may be better prepared to preserve intact the liberties their forefathers won;and
 one of the most valiant warriors in the American struggle for independence was that heroic foe of tyranny and oppression, General Casimir Pulaski, who fell mortally wounded at the siege of Savannah, while fighting for liberty, and died, on October 11, 1779; and
 Public Resolution 110, 74th Congress, approved June 20, 1936, provides:
That the President of the United States is authorized and directed to issue a proclamation calling upon officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all governmental buildings on October 11, 1936, and inviting the people of the United States to observe the day in schools and churches or other suitable places, with appropriate ceremonies in commemoration of the death of General Casimir Pulaski.
, President of the United States of America, do hereby invite the people of the United States to observe October 11, 1936, the one hundred and fifty-seventh anniversary of the glorious death of General Pulaski, as General Pulaski Memorial Day, with appropriate ceremonies in schools and churches or other suitable places, and do direct that the flag shall be displayed upon all Government buildings on that day, as a mark of respect to his memory.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 26th day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-first.
