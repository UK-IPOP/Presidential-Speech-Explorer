Greetings from the White House where it's 37 degrees and sunny.
Pool is gathering at 4 p.m. for the president's return from Camp David.
Marine One touched down on the South Lawn at 4:24 pm. POTUS and the First Lady strode hand in hand into the White House at 4:28 pm.
POTUS ignored shouted questions about the American journalist killed in Ukraine, Iran, and one about whether Putin is a war criminal.
There was a Commander Biden sighting before POTUS landed. The canine came closer to the pool than the president did. Traveling aboard M1 with them:
Anthony Bernal, Assistant to the President & Advisor to the First Lady
Annie Tomasini, Assistant to the President & Director of Oval Office Operations
Yohannes Abraham, Deputy Assistant to the President & Chief of Staff and Executive Secretary for the NSC
