Sir:
I have the honor to transmit herewith for the consideration of Congress a supplemental estimate of appropriation for the Department of State for the fiscal year 1932, to remain available until June 30, 1933, amounting to $40,000, for an International Economic Conference to be held in London during the year 1932.
The details of this estimate, the necessity therefor, and the reason for its transmission at this time are set forth in the letter of the Director of the Bureau of the Budget transmitted herewith, with whose comments and observations thereon I concur.

Respectfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[The President of the Senate]
