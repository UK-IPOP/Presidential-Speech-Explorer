Unless the following two highly objectionable provisions of H.R. 4623 are deleted, the Administration will oppose this bill. The two provisions would:


â€” direct the Administrator to establish and operate an outpatient VA clinic in central or southern New Jersey, at a cost of $16.7 million over the next five years, ignoring the results of VA's detailed studies of the need for new facilities and their priority order.
H.R. 4623 contains a number of other provisions which the Administration opposes as well as some the Administration would support if they were not in a bill with the two provisions described above.
