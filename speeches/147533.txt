The Plan is a set of legislative and administrative steps aim to close the housing supply gap within the next five years.
Secretary Fudge highlighted the Plan at an affordable housing development that is under construction in Columbus, Ohio. She was joined by U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown, U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty, and Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther.
"The Housing Supply Action Plan is the latest step HUD, and the Biden-Harris Administration are taking to expand our nation's supply of affordable housing," 
. "This plan will ease costs for families across the country and give communities the tools they need to make more affordable housing available to residents."
