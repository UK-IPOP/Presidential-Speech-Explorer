 Today, Romney for President launched its newest television ad, "Winning Combination." In this campaign, Governor Romney is the only "full-spectrum conservative" that has the experience, vision and values we need when confronting the challenges our nation faces today. On the economy, his message is "stronger." Governor Romney is "at his best in crisis mode." In this election, he has "the credentials to run the country." In this campaign, newspapers and magazines agree that Governor Romney has the "winning combination."
The ad will begin airing today in Florida. Script and viewing links are below.

 "The economy is emerging as the overriding issue in the 2008 presidential race and Mitt Romney's message is stronger."
 "The economy is emerging as the overriding issue in the 2008 presidential race, and Romney's message on the subject is stronger..."
 "The Economy Is Emerging As The Overriding Issue In The 2008 Presidential Race, And Romney's Message On The Subject Is Stronger..." "Mitt Romney had a light home field advantage in the Michigan primary since he grew up in Detroit and his dad was a three-term governor. But that's not why he won. Romney defeated John McCain because the economy is emerging as the overriding issue in the 2008 presidential race, and Romney's message on the subject is stronger than McCain's. And Romney is far more comfortable and persuasive in talking about the economy." (Fred Barnes, "Romney Gets The Gold,"

 "He's the 'full-spectrum conservative.'" 
 "'A supporter of free-market economics and limited government, moral causes such as the right to life.'"
 "Romney is a full-spectrum conservative."
 "A supporter of free-market economics and limited government, moral causes such as the right to life."
 "Unlike some other candidates in the race, Romney is a full-spectrum conservative: a supporter of free-market economics and limited government, moral causes such as the right to life and the preservation of marriage, and a foreign policy based on the national interest." (Editorial, "Romney for President," 
, 12/11/07)
 "'The credentials to run the country.' 'Romney was at his best in crisis mode.'"
 "Romney ... has the credentials to run the country."
 "Romney was at his best in crisis mode."
 "Meanwhile, Mitt Romney certainly has the credentials to run the country. He is a former Massachusetts governor who turned that state's economy around and proved to be a more than able leader." (Editorial, "'Favorite Son' Romney Is Best GOP Choice In Primary," 
, 1/11/08)
 "Many other observers say Romney was at his best in crisis mode, taking charge of an issue and seeing it through to resolution." (Brian C. Mooney, et al., "Ambitious Goals," 
, 6/30/07)
 "'A winning combination, we vote for Mitt Romney.'" 
 "I'm Mitt Romney and I approved this message."
 "A winning combination ... we vote for Mitt Romney."
 "More than the other primary candidates, Romney has President Bush's virtues and avoids his flaws. His moral positions, and his instincts on taxes and foreign policy, are the same. But he is less inclined to federal activism, less tolerant of overspending, better able to defend conservative positions in debate, and more likely to demand performance from his subordinates. A winning combination, by our lights. In this most fluid and unpredictable Republican field, we vote for Mitt Romney." (Editorial, "Romney for President," 
, 12/11/07)
