PRESIDENT KENNEDY and Prime Minister Macmillan note with deepest regret that the Soviet Union has not accepted their proposal of September 3, that tests in the earth's atmosphere producing fall-out be stopped without delay.
This action contrasts vividly with the Soviet Union's own repeated expressions of concern as to the health hazards of such testing.
The President and the Prime Minister reaffirm the readiness of the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate a controlled nuclear test ban agreement of the widest possible scope.
