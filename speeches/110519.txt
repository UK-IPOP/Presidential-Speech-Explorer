 "The Davisâ€”Bacon Act (DBA) requires the government to pay construction wages that average 22 percent above market rates. This shields unions from competition on federal construction projects. It will also add $10.9 billion to the deficit in 2011. Given that the federal government is already running historic and unsustainable deficits, federal policy should not unnecessarily inflate the cost of federal construction projects. Congress should repeal the DBA." (James Sherk, "Repealing the Davis-Bacon Act Would Save Taxpayers $10.9 Billion,"

 "Organized labor, or what is left of it, has high hopes for the Clinton Presidency. But so far the Administration has put on the back burner all the proposals that might give labor more power, except for one: a bill that would prohibit management from replacing strikers permanently with newly hired workers. And now that bill has become the defining labor issue of the young Clinton Presidency, as important today as the air traffic controllers strike was in the early Reagan years." (Louis Uchitelle, "Labor Has A Big Job For Its New Friend Clinton," 
, 6/27/93)
 "Organized labor says passage of the bill, called the Cesar Chavez Workplace Fairness Act, is needed to reverse the sharp decline in membership and influence that unions experienced in the 1980's. ... Business groups like the United States Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers are lobbying against the measure, arguing that it would unwisely tilt the balance of power in contract negotiations to the unions' favor."

 "Pressure to take some kind of action mounted in Congress all day Thursday despite vigorous lobbying [by] the unions to keep Congress from intervening. In addition to reports of the shutdown's effect on trade and manufacturing, the lawmakers faced the prospect that it might spread to commuter services along the heavily traveled Northeast corridor from Boston to Washington by 12:01 A.M. today."
