With exactly 100 days to go before the Nevada caucus, Hugo Jacobo headed out to knock on doors for Hillary Clinton in Las Vegas.?Hugo is a field organizer, which means he reaches out to the local community, registering voters and talking to neighbors about Hillary's vision for America. Along the way, something happened he wasn't expecting.
When Ernesto and Cristian answered the door, they told Hugo they weren't registered to vote. They got into a conversation about Hillary, the election, and the Nevada caucus (it's Saturday, February 20, for those keeping track at home). Before long, they were chatting like old friends—and Ernesto and Christian were so inspired they wrote a quick song about Hillary, which you should definitely check out.
Keep jamming, Ernesto and Cristian.
