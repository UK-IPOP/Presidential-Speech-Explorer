 "Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich, angry over his poor performance in the Iowa caucuses, may have a new and unlikely partner in his quest to tarnish rival Mitt Romney: President Barack Obama." (Jeff Mason and Scott Malone, "Odd Allies: Gingrich, Obama Align In Attacks On Romney," 
 1/4/12)
 "Obama's campaign would be happy if Gingrich could define Romney in a more negative light, which would allow the president to hold back his own attacks and stay above the fray for a while...It would help Obama, whose advisers are using a similar playbook to Gingrich's in terms of portraying Romney as someone who can't decide between liberal-leaning and conservative-leaning ideas." (Jeff Mason and Scott Malone, "Odd Allies: Gingrich, Obama Align In Attacks On Romney,"

 "Now, as Gingrich faces a disappointing loss in Iowa, he's attacking Romney as harshly as any Democrat. If Gingrich keeps it up, he may do little to improve his chances but add considerably to Obama's anti-Romney highlight reel. Gingrich never intended this to be his legacy. Oops."Â  (Major Garrett, "How Newt Gingrich Blew The Primary And His Political Legacy," 
, 1/5/12)
 "It raises a fundamental question (to borrow a favorite Newt formulation) about Gingrich's campaign: Is he trying to win, and is he employing a strategy that would move him toward something more than settling scores?" (Rick Klein, "Kamikaze Newt: Trying to Win, or Out for Revenge?" 
, 1/5/12)
 FLEISCHER: "[G]etting attacked by Newt Gingrich is somewhat like getting attacked by a porcupine. I mean he just points himself everywhere, attacks everywhere, no strategy, no consistent theme. And he looks so mean when he does it." (CNN, 1/4/12)
 "These attacks appear to break Gingrich's pledge to run a positive-only campaign although the former speaker claims he is just showing contrast, not going negative." (Alex Moe, "Gingrich Takes More Direct Aim At Romney In NH," NBC's "
