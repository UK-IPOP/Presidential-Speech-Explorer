Mr. President:
I am very proud to welcome you to the United States.
As you know, the United States Government-this administration--in fact, our whole people are particularly concerned with our relations to the countries to the south of us. Nature has placed us in one great hemisphere, and it is my strong hope that working together the countries of Latin America and the United States, Canada-working together, we can make this hemisphere a fruitful and peaceful place in which people can live and develop their lives and their talents.
I am particularly glad to have you here, Mr. President, because your efforts in your own country long antedated the common effort which we are attempting to make in the Alliance for Progress through the agreement and Charter of Punta del Este.
Your revolutionary efforts to improve the life of your people, to make nature their ally and not their enemy, to use the resources of your country--the material resources--and to make it possible for the people of your country to have a better chance in life--you have been engaged in this effort for more than 10 years, and we are delighted to have you here.
What you are attempting to do in your own country is what I hope all of us in all of our countries in this hemisphere would try to do for our people and to make this, in this decade, a light--this hemisphere-which can shine with a good deal of pride and a good deal of warmth throughout the entire globe.
So, we are glad to have you, Mr. President, for the effort you are making in your own country. Because your own country is of great importance; it bears a great name in the history of this hemisphere--Bolivia. You yourself as a distinguished scholar as well as political leader have looked strongly to the future, and we wish to associate the United States with this great common enterprise.
We are very proud to have you here, Mr. President
