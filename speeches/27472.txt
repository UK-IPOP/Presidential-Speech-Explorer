Behind the brief words of the citations stand real men who every day are lighting the dark areas of our knowledge. From them we have learned much about the cells in the human body, about human and animal nutrition, and about genetics and evolution. One of these men has helped to wipe out some of the most destructive insect pests we have, and in doing so has solved a major economic problem for livestock raisers in the southwestern part of the country and elsewhere.
We are recognizing a major contributor to communication and computer theory; an extraordinarily brilliant young mathematician, the "father" of television, and the "father" of modern meteorology. We also are recognizing major contributors to astronomy and astrophysics, and to our understanding of the nature and structure of matter.
The group is remarkable for its versatility. One of the engineers being honored has made possible major advances in medicine. One of the biologists is renowned for his work in mathematics and statistics. Several in this group have given much to the cause of our national defense and security.
