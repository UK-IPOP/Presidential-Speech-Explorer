 SEN. MCCAIN: "Mr. President, very briefly, of course, they didn't expect to receive benefits they had to pay into the system because they were here illegally. 
 but, as importantly, the protections under the law, as they now live in the shadows and are exploited and mistreated in many cases. Of course, they didn't expect to. That is why we are going through this process of letting them earn citizenship." (Sen. John McCain, 
, 5/18/06, p. S4745)
 SEN. MCCAIN: "Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the Ensign amendment. Under current law, undocumented immigrants are ineligible for Social Security benefits which I think is entirely appropriate. But we all know that millions of undocumented immigrants pay Social Security and Medicare taxes for years and sometimes decades while they work to contribute to our economy." (Sen. John McCain, 
, 5/18/06, p. S4744)
 SEN. MCCAIN: "The Ensign amendment would undermine the work of these people by preventing lawfully present immigrant workers from claiming Social Security benefits that they earned before they were authorized to work in our country." (Sen. John McCain, 
, 5/18/06, p. S4744)

, 5/18/06, p. S4744)
 SEN. MCCAIN: "It pains me to disagree with my good friend from Nevada on this matter, but I believe the amendment is wrong. It is fundamentally unfair to collect taxes from these workers and then disqualify the taxes paid once the workers achieve legal taxes." (Sen. John McCain, 
, 5/18/06, p. S4744)
 SEN. MCCAIN: "I believe instead of supporting the amendment, we should stand for the principle that people who worked and paid into the Social Security system for years should be able to depend on their retirement income to which they contributed." (Sen. John McCain, 
, 5/18/06, p. S4744)
 SEN. MCCAIN: "What about the fiscal consequences of the amendment? I submit that if Social Security is not available in the future for immigrants, that when they retire or become disabled, then State and local governments and potentially the Federal Government will be forced to absorb significant costs as the Federal Government has refused to provide services and supports paid for by tax dollars of millions of legal immigrants. This amendment would simply continue this trend." (Sen. John McCain, 
, 5/18/06, p. S4744)
