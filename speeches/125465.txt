Bernie Sanders spoke on Tuesday to about 1,500 supporters in Anaheim, California, at a convention center just a few miles away from Disneyland.
He talked about low wages and how the toys sold in the amusement park are made in China.
He also said you are unlikely to see the story on World News Tonight because ABC News is a division of the Walt Disney Co.
So here is some information you probably won't see on TV:
"I say to Walt Disney: It is time to pay your workers a living wage.Â  It is time to provide affordable housing to your employees. It is time to start manufacturing your products in the United States of America," Sanders said.
