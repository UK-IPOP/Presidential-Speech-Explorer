Today, a bipartisan group of 107 former State Attorneys General endorsed Joe Biden for President and Kamala Harris for Vice President. In a statement, the law enforcement officials cited "Joe Biden's career in fighting on behalf of the middle class" and "his proven commitment to fair and just law enforcement"— which was demonstrated in his selection of a "fair and just prosecutor and attorney general as his vice president." The bipartisan endorsement highlights the belief and acknowledgment shared across the aisle that Joe Biden's America will be exponentially safer than Trump's America.





We, the undersigned law enforcement officials, endorse the Biden/Harris ticket for President and Vice President of the United States.

Joe Biden's career has been fighting on behalf of the middle class. As former attorneys general we have seen him share our commitment to eliminate abuses of power – whether economic or physical power – that bear down on the lives of millions of Americans.

Joe Biden believes in common sense law enforcement dedicated to keeping all of us safe whether it is protecting us from violent crime, economic crime, or injustice. Joe was a leader in the establishment of community policing -- where police work closely with local communities to help establish their priorities -- writing and championing the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, establishing the first-ever White House Advisor on Violence Against Women, and launching a national campaign to change the culture surrounding campus rape and sexual assault.

Joe knows that changes are needed in our criminal justice system if we are to assure equality of treatment for all citizens regardless of race or economic standing. Today, too many people are incarcerated in the United States – and too many of them are black or brown. Joe knows that the best way to create safe and healthy communities is not to build prisons, but to build opportunity. He believes that we need to rethink whom we're sending to jail, how we treat those in jail, and how we help them get the health care, education, jobs, and housing necessary to rejoin society after they serve their time. As President, Joe Biden will strengthen America's commitment to justice and reform our criminal justice system.



Joe Biden knows we must reduce the number of people incarcerated in this country while also reducing crime. Drug users should be diverted to drug courts and treatment. Because 90% of those incarcerated today are not in federal custody, Joe Biden knows that the federal government must vigorously support state and local efforts that are dedicated to meaningful reform. Reducing the number of incarcerated individuals will reduce government spending on incarceration and these savings must be reinvested in the communities impacted by mass incarceration.

Our criminal justice system cannot be just unless we root out the racial, gender, and income-based disparities in the system. Black mothers and fathers should feel confident that their children are safe walking the streets and that law enforcement officers are there to support that safety. And, when a police officer pins on that shield and walks out the door, the officer's family should know they will come home at the end of the day.

We agree with Joe Biden that our criminal justice system must be focused on redemption and
rehabilitation. Making sure formerly incarcerated individuals have the opportunity to be productive members of our society is not only the right thing to do, it will also grow our economy.

Finally, Joe Biden has proven his commitment to fair and just law enforcement by selecting a fair and just former prosecutor and attorney general as his Vice President. Kamala Harris understands the needs -- and the complexities -- of modern law enforcement and will work closely with President Biden to restore faith in those who are sworn to protect all of us.
