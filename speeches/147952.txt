FYI: The pool will be riding on an electric school bus from Fairfax County Public schools in the motorcade.
Today, Vice President Harris will announce the availability of $500 million in funding from the $5 billion Clean School Bus Program that was established by President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The announcement will be made by the Vice President during an event at Meridian High School in Falls Church, VA with EPA Administrator Regan and Infrastructure Coordinator Mitch Landrieu.
While at Meridian High School, the Vice President and the group will see electric school buses and receive a briefing from manufacturers, educators, and students – before delivering remarks making the announcement.
School buses are our nation’s largest form of mass transit, with 25 million kids riding one of the nation’s nearly 500,000 school buses each day, nearly all of which are diesel buses that emit millions of tons of greenhouse gases each year. These buses also cause pollution linked to asthma and other health issues that cause students to miss school. But we know that electric and zero-emission school buses eliminate the greenhouse gas and particulate pollution that harm our communities and our planet.
That is why, as a Senator, Vice President Harris led the Clean School Bus Act, the first bill to focus exclusively on zero emission school buses. And since taking office, the Vice President has made it a point to highlight the importance of transitioning to zero-emission vehicles, emphasizing the benefits of good jobs, cleaner air, and reduced costs. As part of this, she visited an electric school bus manufacturer in High Point, North Carolina, met with public transit districts working to electrify their fleets in Cincinnati, Ohio, and Charlotte, North Carolina, visited with an electric semi-truck driver in New York City, and more.
With today’s announcement, $500 million is now available for school districts and other eligible school bus operators and contractors to begin replacing the nation’s fleet of school buses with clean, American-made, zero-emission buses. This $500 million is the first round of funding out of the unprecedented $5 billion investment for low and zero-emission school buses over the next five years, and it represents yet another step the Biden-Harris Administration is taking to invest in American manufacturing, protect the health of our communities, and tackle the climate crisis.
The VP walked out at 1:52, and looked over at the bus. She got in the motorcade and we started rolling out at 1:53.
After a pretty uneventful ride, despite being in a school bus, We arrived about 2:13 to Mary Ellen Henderson Middle School. Did not see VP when we got here.
Buses were built in High Point, North Carolina. Vice President Harris toured the factory in April when the administration was pushing for the BIF.
The rep from Thomas says the bus is a Fairfax bus, part of the Dominion Program that paid for 50 electric buses in Virginia. 150 of the buses are operating in the US, including at least one in Alaska.
Some more info on the buses from WH and Thomas: The buses can cost up to 300,000 -365,000 per bus with 58K for charging infrastructure. The funding that Vice President Harris is announcing today can cover up to 25 buses and 25 charging stations per applicant. Decision on how many buses applicants get is based off of the Justice 40 criteria including low income, pollution burden and whether it's a tribal school district.
Vice President Harris walked out with Michael Regan and Mitch Landrieu. She greeted three reps for the bus manufacturers. Pool couldn't really hear what they were saying but Vice President Harris could be heard talking about the administration's focus on disparities.
It's about "Taking care of all of our children. ... I'm just so excited about the school buses!"
Harris was moved over to meet with moms from Moms Clean Air Force.
One of the kids who is riding on the buses named Valencia told Harris about riding the old diesel buses:
"Do you smell anything on these buses?" Harris asked the youngest kid Valencia.
"Just the tires."
"Tell me what I need to know," Harris said to the older kid named Alex.
"I think the buses will be amazing for the environment." Kid named Alex.
"That's the thing that you guys are so smart about. Something that is bad and harmful, it doesn't have to be that way. ... how about we change that and make it right?" Harris told the kids.
Harris met with four kids from the schooL and asked them, "Okay teach us what we need to know" One kid says it's about "planet, people profit. These buses are a great example of that."
The second kid talked to Harris about living in Kenya ( his parents work for the state department.) He also talked about how he is optimistic about the
The third kid talked about her class which is building small solar powered cars. She talked to Harris about teamwork and communication while building.
"Wonderful work. I'm very excited about the future of our country!"
