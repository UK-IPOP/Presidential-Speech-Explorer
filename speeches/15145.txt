Your Majesty, and Your Royal Highness:
It is a very great pleasure indeed for me, as the head of the Government of the United States, to welcome you to this country.
I hope you will have a most pleasant visit, and that you will go away friendlier than when you came, if that is possible. I want to say to you that Mrs. Truman and I are highly appreciative of the cordiality with which you treated our daughter when she was in your great country, and I hope that we, to some extent, will be able to return that hospitality.
My daughter is out on a concert tour, because as you know, her plans were changed and she has to appear when she agrees to. I am very sorry that she is not here, but I am not half so sorry as she is.
I hope you will have a grand time while you are here.
