Yesterday, President Biden announced his intent to nominate Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, one of our nation's brightest legal minds, as Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. President Biden sought a candidate with exceptional credentials, unimpeachable character, and unwavering dedication to the rule of law. Judge Jackson formerly clerked for Justice Breyer, and has broad experience across the legal profession – as a federal appellate judge, a federal district court judge, a member of the U.S. Sentencing Commission, an attorney in private practice, and as a federal public defender. She has been confirmed by the Senate on a bipartisan basis three times – most recently last year for her current seat. If confirmed, Jackson will be the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court.
A broad range of elected leaders at the tribal, local, and state levels issued statements applauding her qualifications and acknowledging her historic nomination.
"In nominating Ketanji Brown Jackson to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court, President Biden has selected an outstanding jurist to succeed Justice Steven Breyer. As a current federal appellate judge, and former vice chair of the U.S. Sentencing Commission, public defender, and Supreme Court clerk to Justice Breyer, Judge Jackson's experience, perspective, and voice will be a valuable addition to the bench. I applaud President Biden's choice and commend his commitment to ensuring that our nation's highest court better reflects the nation itself." [

Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is an exceptionally qualified candidate for the Supreme Court.

One of America's brightest legal minds, Judge Jackson will make history as the first Black woman on the Supreme Court, where she will rule on the issues that matter most to Michiganders from workers' rights, voting rights, reproductive rights, and many more.

Furthermore, if she is nominated, she would replace her former mentor, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who helped shape her legal approach and would in no way disrupt the court's current convictions.??I wholeheartedly agree with President Biden's statement that for too long, our government and courts haven't looked like America. I welcome this nomination and am immensely grateful that we are entering an era reflective of Dr. King's Dream during Black History Month. Certainly, Judge Brown Jackson's distinguished career in service to the American people, capped by a scrupulous character, is appropriately recognized by this historic nomination."?

Throughout our history, extraordinary people have run their leg of the relay toward a fairer, more just society. Harriet Tubman ran her leg of the relay. Rosa Parks ran her leg, as did Shirley Chisholm and Marsha P. Johnson, and so many more. And then New York's own Judge Constance Baker Motley opened the doors as the first Black female federal judge in our nation. Now, with her history-making nomination, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is poised to continue her leg of the relay as the first Black woman to be nominated as an Associate Justice to the highest court in the land. Throughout her impressive legal career, Judge Jackson has been a clear and consistent voice for the voiceless, and someone who has been willing to identify and address the enduring inequalities that still plague our nation. Not only does Judge Jackson's nomination represent an historic moment for this country, but by making her his first Supreme Court pick, President Biden is showing that he is serious about having a court that better reflects the diversity of the United States. I commend President Biden on this stellar choice, and I thank Associate Justice Stephen Breyer for his years of service to this nation." [Press Release, 2/25/22]

"At a time when Americans continue to reckon with the past, present, and future of our nation, this nomination stands as a beacon of hope and a testament to the importance of representation. It also stands as a stark reminder that the 700,000 Americans living in Washington, DC will not be represented in the Senate's confirmation process – a wrong that can only be righted by making Washington, DC the 51st state. But as this nomination proves, we are not done moving toward a more perfect union, and in DC, we are not done fighting for full access to our nation's democracy."
