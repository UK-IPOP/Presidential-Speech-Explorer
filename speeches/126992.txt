The majority of the Republican electorate, the majority of Republican voters in this country do not want Donald Trump to be the nominee. I think that is pretty clear now. The problem is that they're divided up among four people. At some point in South Carolina, it was five people and before that seven people. So until there is some consolidation here, you aren't going to have a clear alternative to Donald Trump. And the argument we have made: I'm as conservative as everyone in this race, but I am the conservative that can unify the Republican Party.
