 â€” The John Edwards for President campaign announced that Oregon State Senate President Pro Tem Margaret Carter and attorney and democratic activist Robert Stoll would lead the campaign's efforts in Oregon.
"I am glad to have the support of Margaret Carter, Robert Stoll and all these important Oregon leaders," said Edwards. "I look forward to working with them to address the critical issues facing our nation and to fundamentally change America."
Carter is President Pro Tem of the Oregon State Senate and was the Oregon Chair for President Clinton's 1992 and 1996 Presidential campaign.
"I support John Edwards because he is the only candidate that boldly stands up to an issue America wants to hear about and that is poverty," said Carter. "It takes courage and conviction to do that."
Stoll is a Portland attorney and was the chair of Kerry-Edwards campaign in Oregon in 2004. He also chaired Governor Kulongoski's campaigns, among many other campaigns in Oregon.
"John Edwards impresses me because of his clear vision, forthright and clear position on the most important issues facing our country: getting the US out of the Iraq civil war; having a country and world divided between those who have much and those who don't; and honesty and integrity in our government."
