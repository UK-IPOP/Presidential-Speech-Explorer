Halfway through implementing reform, we have already significantly reduced our uninsured population. Some 300,000 new enrollees represents almost 5% of our entire state population and over half the (pre-reform) uninsured, by most credible estimates of that number." (Massachusetts Commonwealth Connector, 
, Accessed 1/25/08)
 "After receiving bids from 10 carriers, for the first plan year, six different carriers are now offering 42 plan options through the Connector for the unsubsidized population, and enrollment in those plans began on May 1. That's approximately 41 more options than most Americans have today. Nationally, 80 percent of companies offering health benefits provide workers a choice of one plan - take it or leave it. Outside of federal workers in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, Massachusetts citizens getting health insurance through the Connector are among the only group of Americans who can shop in a competitive health insurance market with such a broad range of health care choices." (Edmund F. Haislmaier, "The Massachusetts Health Reform: Assessing its Significance and Progress, 
, 9/21/07)
 "Pre-reform, the lowest premium for a typical uninsured 37-year-old in Boston was $335 per month with a $5,000 annual deductible. Now, through the Connector, the same individual can get health coverage for $184 per month ($118 pre-tax) with a $2,000 deductible - well below the $250 a month target set back when the legislation was being developed. Indeed, most can get a health plan worth twice the value at half the price." (Edmund F. Haislmaier, "The Massachusetts Health Reform: Assessing its Significance and Progress,

 GOVERNOR ROMNEY: "Of course, taking off those burdens is only part of the solution. If we're going to be the world's greatest economic power, we also have to invest in the future. It's time for us to be bold. I will make a five-fold increase – from $4 billion to $20 billion – in our national investment in energy research, fuel technology, materials science, and automotive technology. Let's invest in our future." (Governor Mitt Romney, Remarks, Detroit, MI, 1/14/08)

 "In New Hampshire, a state McCain had won in 2000 and lavished time and attention on this time around, he lost self-identified Republicans narrowly – 35 percent to 34 percent – to former governor Mitt Romney. But, it was among independents where McCain's winning margin came as he won that bloc by 13 points over Romney."
