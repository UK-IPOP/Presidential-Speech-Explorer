Pool Reports by 
, 
Good Morning from the White House,
Your pooler has received her COVID test and is in position.
There's a 1p.m. press briefing, a 12:05 pool spray with POTUS, VPOTUS, Sec. of Defense & Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and at 3:45p.m. POTUS will sign another pair of Executive Orders.
I'm around if you have questions.
Cheers,
Laura
POTUS spoke from Resolute Desk at his side were VPOTUS and Defense Sec Austin.
Signed the Executive Order reversing Trump era ban on Transgender serving in military.
"This is reinstating the position" that "other secretaries have supported"
Said order allows all "qualified Americans to serve their country in Uniform."
Austin did not respond to question asked by CNN's Kaitlin Collins about the historic nature of his role.
Pool escorted out shortly after, about 12:19pm
Hi All,
Checked with lower press they indicate press briefing will start at 1:15pm and they need to end by 2pm.
Two minute warning issued at 1:15p.m
Lunch Lid called, enjoy
Gathering for the 3:45pm executive order signing event.
South Auditorium apparently has bad internet service, so just a heads up if there are delays on my end
POTUS entered at 3:42 with VPOTUS
The South Court Auditorium stage has been fitted with a backdrop that reads: "The Future Will Be Made In America"
No Audience. Just some 10 staffers (by my count) standing socially distanced along walls.
We have a lid as of 5:03p.m.
Good Night all!
