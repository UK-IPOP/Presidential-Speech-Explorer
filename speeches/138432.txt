SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA): "Well, listen, the idea is that everyone gets access to medical care, and you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give you approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require. Who of us has not had that situation where you've got to wait for approval, and the doctor says, well, I don't know if your insurance company is going to cover this. Let's eliminate all of that. Let's move on." (Sen. Kamala Harris, Remarks At A CNN Town Hall, Des Moines, IA 1/29/19)

A supporter of abortion rights, Harris voted against a bill that would limit abortions to the first 20 weeks of pregnancy.

 CNN'S DON LEMON: "Another issue that I want to talk to you about this is really important I'm not sure if we were watching earlier but Senator Bernie Sanders said that that he is in favor of felons being able to vote while serving in prison. He was asked specifically, about people like the Boston marathon bomber, also people were convicted of sexual assault. He said, this is a quote, 'the right to vote is inherent to our democracy, yes even for terrible people.' Do you agree with that Senator?" SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA): "I agree that the right to vote is one of the very important components of citizenship and it is something that people should should not be stripped of needlessly, which is why I have been a long, advocate of making sure that the formerly incarcerated are not denied a right to vote, which is the case in so many states in our country, in some states permanently deprived of the right to vote, and these are policies that go back to Jim Crow, these are policies that go back to the heart of policies that have been about disenfranchisement policies that continue until today and we need to take it seriously." LEMON: "People who are in convicted in prison like the Boston Marathon bomber, death row, people who are convicted of sexual assault they should be able to vote?" SENATOR HARRIS: "I think we should have that conversation." (Sen. Kamala Harris, Remarks At A CNN Town Hall, Manchester, NH, 4/22/20)








 "In what may be the first such campaign of its kind, the city plans to publish Multilanguage brochures and fill the airwaves with advertisements relaying assurance that San Francisco will not report them to federal immigration authorities. Mayor Gavin Newsom said the campaign was simply an amplification of a longstanding position of not cooperating with immigration raids or other enforcement. The city passed a so-called sanctuary ordinance in 1989." (Jessie McKinley, "San Francisco Reaches Out To Immigrants,"

"Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency should be reevaluated 'from scratch' following the political fallout of the Trump administration's zero tolerance policy that resulted in family separations at the border. 'I think there's no question that we've got to critically reexamine ICE, and its role, and the way that it is being administered, and the work it is doing,' Harris said during an interview on MSNBC's 'Kasie DC.' 'And we need to probably be thinking about starting from scratch because there's a lot that is wrong with the way that it is conducting itself. Harris' comments, made in an interview broadcast on Sunday, come after New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon this week called for the abolition of ICE, describing it as a 'terrorist organization.'"

 "Joseph R. Biden Jr. repeatedly found himself on the defensive in the Democratic debate on Thursday over his record as well as his personal views, with the most searing moment of the night, and the primary campaign to date, coming when Senator Kamala Harris confronted him over his comments on working with segregationists in the Senate."

 SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA): "And it was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing. And, you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me. So I will tell you that, on this subject, it cannot be an intellectual debate among Democrats. We have to take it seriously. We have to act swiftly. As attorney general of California, I was very proud to put in place a requirement that all my special agents would wear body cameras and keep those cameras on." (Sen. Kamala Harris, 
, Miami, FL, 6/28/19)






 SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA): "I have no intention of attacking Joe Biden, but I am going to point out our differences of opinion on a very critical moment in the history of the United States. 1954, the United States Supreme Court unanimously decided 
because there were segregationists in the history of our country, including those members of the United States Senate who lived their careers and their reputations on the basis of ensuring that racists would not be educated together. So, the issue came up before the debate many days if not weeks, which was the comments made about those segregationists, and our difference of opinions of who they were, and that they worked on an issue that directly affected me, which was this issue of busing." (ABC The View, 6/12/19)






SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA): "Listen, this is a presidential race, and I absolutely agree and believe and maintain that we should not have personal attacks against each other we should not be attacking each other but we are on a debate stage." ABC's MEGHAN MCCAIN: "Biden called you, 'slick and slippery,' a Biden advisor called you that." HARRIS: "You know what, we are on a debate stage and if you're not prepared, if you are not ready for somebody to point out a difference of opinion about the history of segregation in our country and what was necessary to deal with that, which at that time was busing, then you're probably not ready." (ABC The View, 6/12/19)






"In an interview with 'CBS This Morning' Friday, Harris responded to criticism from Biden's camp that the contentious moment was a 'low blow.' 'It was about just speaking truth and as I've said many times, I have a great deal of respect for Joe Biden...but he and I disagree on that,' Harris said. She added, 'My purpose was to really just make sure that in this conversation we are appreciating the impact on real people of policies that have been pushed in the history of our country.' The California Democrat stood out amongst the packed crowd of 10 candidates on stage, eliciting some of the loudest applause after she forced moderators to give her time to answer a question on race relations -- noting that she was the only African American present on the debate stage. Harris later said she does not believe the former vice president is a racist but called his statement about finding 'common ground' with segregationists personally 'hurtful' to people of color like her."

"Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) knocked Joe Biden on Wednesday after the former vice president said the 1994 crime bill he helped write did not lead to mass incarceration. 'I have a great deal of respect for Vice President Joe Biden, but I disagree with him,' Harris, a former prosecutor, told reporters in New Hampshire. 'That crime bill, that 1994 crime bill, it did contribute to mass incarceration in our country. It encouraged and was the first time that we had a federal three-strikes law. It funded the building of more prisons in the states. So, I disagree, sadly.'" (Tal Axelrod, "Harris Knocks Biden On Crime Bill: 'It Did Contribute To Mass Incarceration In Our Country',"

"The records show that while Harris' overall conviction rate has reached new highs over the past several years, that success is based almost entirely on plea deals negotiated before defendants accused of serious crimes proceed to trial. (Such pleas form the bulk of any D.A.'s convictions.) By contrast, felony convictions for cases that actually go to trial and reach a jury verdict — a comparatively small group that nevertheless includes some of a district attorney's most violent and emotionally charged cases — have declined significantly over the past two years." (Peter Jamison, "A Lack Of Conviction," 
, 5/5/10)



"In 2009, San Francisco prosecutors won a lower percentage of their felony jury trials than their counterparts at district attorneys' offices covering the 10 largest cities in California, according to data on case outcomes compiled by officials at the San Francisco Superior Court as well as by other county courts and prosecutors. (Officials in Sacramento, the state's seventh-largest city, did not provide data.) Harris' at-trial felony conviction rate that year was 76 percent, down 12 points from the previous year." (Peter Jamison, "A Lack Of Conviction," 
, 5/5/10)

"In the first quarter of 2010, things got worse. During that time, Harris' office secured guilty verdicts in just 53 percent of its felony trials — a remarkable figure, revealing that defendants accused of serious crimes who took their case to trial had an even one-in-two shot at winning an acquittal. By contrast, the most recent recorded statewide average was 83 percent, according to statistics from the California Judicial Council." (Peter Jamison, "A Lack Of Conviction," 
, 5/5/10)



"A recent surge in homicides and violent crime has put the spotlight on The City's law enforcement efforts, with city leaders looking to a variety of solutions — including surveillance cameras, foot patrols, enforcement of a city curfew. To date, San Francisco has had 66 homicides in 2006; in 2005, there were 96 murders, up from 88 in 2004." (Bonnie Eslinger, "S.F.'s Felony Conviction Rate Improves," 
, 9/15/06)

"The homicide rate in San Francisco rose steadily from 2005 to 2008, with 100 homicides in 2007. Table 1 illustrates the violent crime trends from 2005 to 2009. Prior to 2009 San Francisco experienced over 80 homicides a year. Nonetheless, of the 98 homicides reported for 2008, approximately 38% were youth and young adults aged 14 to 25. Of those youth and young adult victims 94% were high school dropouts12. Although 50 homicides were reported in 2010 in San Francisco13, 2011 presents a significant challenge for the community since by April 20 homicides have been reported; five more than were reported in 2010 and nine more than reported in 2009 at this time of the year. There is a clear need for intervention strategies and techniques to reduce the harm caused by street violence in the City and County of San Francisco." ("Street Violence Reduction Initiative,"

"Espinoza, an undercover gang officer, and his partner were on patrol in an unmarked car April 10 when they spotted David Hill, 21, a reputed gang member. Police say Espinoza got out of the car, identified himself as a police officer and approached Hill.

"Danielle Bologna says she wants San Francisco District Attorney Kamala Harris - who has pledged never to seek the death penalty - to understand a little of what she must endure and to seek the death penalty for her family's killer.

, 5/8/04)

"But police union President Gary Delagnes said the candidates were never asked how they would handle the prosecution of a murdered officer. 'Let's face it. We're cops in San Francisco. We're realistic,' Delagnes said of the city's aversion to capital punishment. 'But when it's one of our own, that's a different ballgame. When it comes to protecting the safety of our cops on the street, we believe a clear message needs to be sent.'" (Lee Romney And Carl Ingram, "Officer's Murder Divides San Francisco,"

"Today, however, Kevin Martin, vice president of San Francisco police union, said officers are 'grateful for the efforts of the court and certainly the D.A.'s office.' He said officers would have still liked to have seen a death sentence, but, 'given the cultural environment and political terrain of San Francisco, life without parole is probably the best we're going to get.'"

"Dixon was arrested again in September 2005 after officers found heroin and cocaine on her and in her house. A month later, Broussard — less than three weeks past his 18th birthday — and several juveniles assaulted art student Christopher Hall, then 20, aboard a Muni bus full of Halloween revelers, robbing him of his iPod, wallet and money. The attack was recorded by a surveillance camera. Hall didn't return phone calls seeking comment." (Josh Richman, "Bailey Suspect Had Hard Youth,"

"A 19-year-old handyman who investigators say has confessed to killing Oakland Post Editor Chauncey Bailey with a shotgun is not believed to have worked alone, police said Monday. Police said Devaughndre Broussard, 19, admitted pulling the trigger in Thursday's ambush killing in downtown Oakland. However, 'we don't believe he worked on his own, and I can't get into specifics,' said Assistant Police Chief Howard Jordan. 'We're still trying to investigate how the plan was developed and who was involved in the plan.'" (Henry K. Lee And Matthai Kuruvila, "New Details On Man Who Confessed To Killing Editor,"

"The man who killed journalist Chauncey Bailey by shooting him three times at point-blank range while he was walking to work in downtown Oakland four years ago was sentenced today to 25 years in state prison. Devaughndre Broussard, 23, could have faced life in prison for killing Bailey, 57, on Aug. 2, 2007, and a second man, Odell Roberson Jr., 31, on July 8, 2007, as he initially was charged with two counts of murder. But on May 7, 2009, prosecutors allowed Broussard to plead guilty to two counts of the lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter and receive a shorter prison term in exchange for his testimony against Your Black Muslim Bakery Yusuf Bey IV."

 "A San Francisco judge ordered a 22-year-old alleged gang member Monday to stand trial in the slaying of a father and his two sons, citing the testimony of a surviving family member who said he got a good look at the defendant's face as he opened fire on an Excelsior district street. Superior Court Judge Teri Jackson said Edwin Ramos should be tried on charges that he murdered Tony Bologna, 48, and his sons Michael, 20, and Matthew, 16, as they drove near their home the afternoon of June 22, 2008. Authorities believe Ramos mistook one of the younger men for a rival while looking to retaliate for the shootings of two fellow MS-13 gang members earlier that day."

"But Harris took a different approach as San Francisco district attorney from 2004-11. In a 2008 letter to the editor in The Recorder, a legal newspaper, Harris boasted that her office 'nearly tripled the number of misdemeanor cases taken to trial' since 2003 and argued that misdemeanor crimes "erode our quality of life and are often a gateway to more serious offenses that jeopardize public safety.'"

"Lawyers under the oversight of then-Attorney General of California Kamala Harris argued in 2014 against the release of nonviolent criminals because they wanted to keep them for cheap labor. 'Extending 2-for-1 credits to all minimum custody inmates at this time would severely impact fire camp participation — a dangerous outcome while California is in the middle of a difficult fire season and severe drought,' lawyers from Harris's office wrote in a filing. The attorney general arrived at that stance in reaction to a chain of events following a 2011 Supreme Court decision ruling that California's prison overcrowding was in violation of the Constitution's cruel and unusual punishment clause. In 2014, as overcrowding persisted, a three-judge panel in California ordered the state to make eligible for parole nonviolent prisoners with only two felonies that had served half their sentences. Harris' lawyers argued early release would harm the prison's labor program, which included its work program to help fight California's wildfires. The judges rejected the argument."

"When she was the San Francisco district attorney, Harris took it upon herself to boost school attendance rates. She did this by threatening to prosecute parents whose kids missed too many school days without good reason. 'I believe a child going without an education is tantamount to a crime, so I decided I was going to start prosecuting parents for truancy,' Harris said in a 2010 speech."

"When San Francisco police broke down a door inside a group home for mentally disabled people in 2008 and shot a 56-year-old resident, then-District Attorney Kamala Harris didn't charge the officers with a crime. Instead she prosecuted the schizophrenic woman who was severely injured in the shooting. Harris charged Teresa Sheehan with assaulting the officers, alleging she came at them with a kitchen knife after they forced their way into her room."
