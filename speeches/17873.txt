IN COMMON with millions of my countrymen, I salute the gallantry and stamina of the Commander and soldiers who are defending Dien Bien Phu. We have the most profound admiration for the brave and resourceful fight being waged there by troops from France, Vietnam, and other parts of the French Union. Those soldiers, true to their own great traditions, are defending the cause of human freedom and are demonstrating in the truest fashion qualities on which the survival of the free world depends. I would be grateful if you would convey to the Commander of the gallant garrison of Dien Bien Phu this expression of my admiration and best wishes.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
