I'm announcing this morning and first on your show that I'm going to endorse Marco Rubio for President. And Alisyn, I think it comes down to this: He's strong, he's also informed, he's conservative and he's electable and he can unite the party and you can't ask for much more than that. I think he has got the total package.
