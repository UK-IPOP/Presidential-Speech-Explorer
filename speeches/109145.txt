"Governor Romney's government-mandated health care plan provided free care for illegal immigrants in Massachusetts, establishing just the kind of illegal immigration magnet Governor Romney claims to oppose," said Perry spokesman Mark Miner.

Romneycare, which President Obama's health care takeover was modeled after, has already been shown to have killed 18,000 jobs in Massachusetts and resulted in $8 billion in additional cost to taxpayers. [3, 4]
