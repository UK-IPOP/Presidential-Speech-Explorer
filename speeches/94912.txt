Review of Recommendations From the Public Interest Declassification Board

The Public Interest Declassification Board, an advisory group established by the Public Interest Declassification Act of 2000, as amended (50 U.S.C. 435 note), has submitted a report entitled "Improving Declassification." The report addresses 15 issues and makes 49 recommendations relating to declassification of classified national security information.

Please submit in writing no later than April 15, 2008, through the Assistants to the President for National Security Affairs and for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, your views on each of the recommendations, including with respect to each recommendation your view of whether and to what extent it should be implemented. Your views with respect to the recommendations should take into account the public interest in declassification of national security information, effective records management, and the effective conduct of United States diplomatic, economic, military, energy, homeland security, and intelligence activities, as well as such other matters as you deem appropriate for consideration.
