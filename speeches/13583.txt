To the Senate of the United States:
With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith the treaty of general relations and protocol between the United States of America and the Republic of the Philippines signed at Manila on July 4, 1946. I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the Secretary of State with respect to that treaty and protocol.
In view of the unique relationship existing between the United States of America and the Republic of the Philippines and the desire of our Government and people to further the interests of the Government and people of the Republic of the Philippines, I should be grateful for the earliest possible consideration of the treaty and protocol by the Senate.
