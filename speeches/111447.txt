"Under President Obama, the costs of college have skyrocketed – making it more difficult for students to attend college – and his economic policies have made it harder for graduates to get jobs. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have a Plan for a Stronger Middle Class to get our economy back on track and ensure that young Americans – and all Americans – have the brighter future they deserve." – Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 PINDELL: "An 18-year-old who voted for you back in 2008, and there certainly were a lot of them, now turning 22, many of them graduating from college with what amounts to basically a mortgage in debt, having a hard time finding a job for which they've been trained. Why should they be confident that by the time they turn 26, that they'll be better off with another four years?" OBAMA: "Well, they can look at my track record." (WMUR, 8/20/12)

 "As in the housing market, securitization of student loans led to more aggressive underwriting for borrowers who could not possibly afford the debt they took on, according to a government report. The 131-page report was formally released by the Education Department and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Friday. It provides new estimates for total outstanding student loan debt: more than $1 trillion in 2011, composed of $864 billion in federal government loans and $150 billion in private student loan debt. Cumulative defaults on private student loans exceeded $8 billion, a sum from over 850,000 distinct loans." (Catherine Rampell, "Report Details Woes Of Student Loan Debt,"

 "With more than $1 trillion in student loans outstanding in this country, crippling debt is no longer confined to dropouts from for-profit colleges or graduate students who owe on many years of education, some of the overextended debtors in years past. Now nearly everyone pursuing a bachelor's degree is borrowing. As prices soar, a college degree statistically remains a good lifetime investment, but it often comes with an unprecedented financial burden." (Andrew Martin and Andrew W. Lehren, "A Generation Hobbled By The Soaring Cost Of College," 
, 5/12/12)
 "About 1.5 million, or 53.6 percent, of bachelor's degree-holders under the age of 25 last year were jobless or underemployed, the highest share in at least 11 years. In 2000, the share was at a low of 41 percent, before the dot-com bust erased job gains for college graduates in the telecommunications and IT fields." (Hope Yen, "1 In 2 New Graduates Are Jobless Or Underemployed,"

 "While a university degree still promises a higher income than a high school diploma, the median income of college graduates fell nearly 10 per cent from 2007 to 2010, according to the Fed, compared with a 5 per cent fall for high school graduates." (Shannon Bond, "Jobless Generation Puts Brakes On US," 
, 7/30/12)
 "But the problem has a unique flavour in the US, where the weak job market has collided with record levels of educational debt – about $25,000 for the average graduate. Together, they pose a threat to the future earning power of young Americans such as Mr Grzywacz – and could have long-lasting effects on US growth."
