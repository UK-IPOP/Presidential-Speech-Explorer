"When rising unemployment prompts the president to say the private sector is 'doing fine,' it's obvious something's wrong. Twenty-three million Americans are struggling for work in the Obama economy, and they certainly aren't 'doing fine.' After nearly four years of outdated liberal policies that have failed to get our economy moving again, Americans have run out of patience – and President Obama is running out of time." –Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson

 "At the moment, the new law is making health care slightly less affordable. Independent health care experts say the law has caused some insurance premiums to rise. As we wrote in October, the new law has caused about a 1 percent to 3 percent increase in health insurance premiums for employer-sponsored family plans because of requirements for increased benefits. Last year's premium increases cast even more doubt on another promise the president has made - that the health care law would 'lower premiums by up to $2,500 for a typical family per year.'"
