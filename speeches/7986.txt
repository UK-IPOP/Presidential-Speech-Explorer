My dear Mr. Dawes:
Will you please extend my cordial greetings to the delegates attending the convention of the Mississippi Valley Association. Their consistent support of a forward-looking policy of internal waterway improvement is a valuable force in preparing for an ever-increasing prosperity of a vast section of our country.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
