Dear Winston:
This medallion, struck to commemorate your eighty-first birthday, is a timely recognition both of your lifelong friendship toward the United States and of the incalculable debt owed you by all mankind for your unfaltering defense of peace with justice, and the freedom of men.
The English-speaking peoples--and the entire world--are the better for the wisdom of your counsel, for the inspiration of your unflagging optimism and for the heartening example of your shining courage. You have been a towering leader in the quest for peace, as you were in the battle for freedom through the dark days of war.
In that light, the medallion is a token of America's enduring gratitude. But more than that, it sharpens in our minds today the eternal faith that the forces of evil cannot triumph over men whose courage is many times fortified by dedication to human freedom, to human rights, to the God-guided destiny of free men.
Warm sentiment is mingled with gratitude as I send this medallion, provided by American friends of yours, to commemorate your birthday. Millions of my countrymen join me in tribute to you on this anniversary and in best wishes for long and happy years ahead.

With warm regard,

As ever,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
