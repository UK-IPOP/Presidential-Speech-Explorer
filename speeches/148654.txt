 [
]—the French election, sir?
 Well, we feel good about the French election, number one.
Number two, I tried to talk to him last night. We spoke with his staff, but he was at the Eiffel Tower having a good time. So I'm going to be talking to him today.
And did you speak with Secretary Blinken or Secretary Austin after their trip to Ukraine?
 We're going to be doing that now. I haven't spoke—I've spoken to them before and on the way, but I haven't to them—[
].
And what did you think of their trip?
How do you think it went, sir?
 It went good.
