"The Obama team refuses to take a stand on whether Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. After initially claiming in 2008 that Jerusalem should remain the capital, President Obama and his advisers have shamefully ducked and dodged on the President's position. As president, Mitt Romney would ensure Israel has a steadfast ally in the United States, including support for its capital, Jerusalem." â€” Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman

 OBAMA: "Israel I think has a historic claim on Jerusalem. I think that obviously there are sacred sites in the Old City that are central to not just Judaism but also to Islam and Christianity. I think it is very important for us to find a way in which all those claims are respected. This is something that I think is very important for the parties themselves to decide, but I believe that it is not an acceptable option for Jerusalem to be severed from Israel along the lines of the 1967 borders. That is not going to be an option." (Senator Barack Obama, Remarks In A Q&A Session,
