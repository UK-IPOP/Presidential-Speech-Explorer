I HAVE received an interim report on the Food-For-Peace program. This commendable effort provides a constructive use of our agricultural capabilities and is our chief weapon in the world-wide war against want and hunger.
There is no form of overseas assistance which this country is better able to provide than the supplying of American farm products and agricultural science.
The overwhelming share of our food-for-Peace effort is going to the nations of Asia, Latin America, the Mediterranean area, and Africa which need it most.
I note with gratification the achievements of the program thus far. I am heartened by the prospect that our accomplishment can be further improved, with emphasis on a continuing effort to make sure that the hazards of the program will be minimized.
I am making this report public since it deals with matters of current and prospective importance at home and abroad.
