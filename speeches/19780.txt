[ Released April 26, 1958. Dated April 25, 1958 ]
Dear__________:
In my message of April 15 to the Senate concerning S. 497, I pointed out that there were included many water resource development projects that were in the public interest. I believe these should be promptly enacted into law.
There is enclosed a list, designated Attachment A, of those projects and provisions which were included in S. 497 as passed by the Congress, the authorization and enactment of which I recommend at an early date.
I am also enclosing another list, designated Attachment B, of projects and provisions which I also recommend when modified as indicated.
I would like to reiterate what I said in my message of April 15 about the proposals for protection from hurricane flooding in tidal waters. These are useful and necessary projects, but further thought must be given to the degree of local participation in the cost of such work. The Secretary of the Army is now preparing suggestions as to appropriate division of responsibility for this program. I shall submit my recommendations for legislation on this score to the Congress in the near future.

Legislation consistent with the foregoing will be approved.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
