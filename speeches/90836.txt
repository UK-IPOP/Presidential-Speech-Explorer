A prominent social conservative said Wednesday he finds Republican presidential hopeful Fred Thompson acceptable as a party nominee but warned many Christian voters would desert the Republican ticket if Rudy Giuliani is the 2008 nominee.
Family Research Council President Tony Perkins said that, in his view, former U.S. Sen. Thompson "has a record that shows he is conservative socially. I think he has a record that shows he is a fiscal conservative as well as being strong in the area of foreign policy and national defense."
He said former New York City Mayor Giuliani is the only candidate running among the Republicans "who has stated a pro-abortion-rights position."
"I think it would be very problematic to put forth a candidate that's broken with 30 years of Republican history," he said.
