Mr. President, Senora:

We are glad to welcome to this Capital and to this house the President of El Salvador and his charming wife.
In these days of tensions, no country can have any greater or more pride of possession than real friends. America--the United States of America--counts itself fortunate in its good friends. And friends and countries are not measured in value by the extent of territory or the size of their populations. They are, rather, measured by their constancy, their loyalty, and their dedication to their friends, to common values, priceless values that free men possess--above even life itself.
And it is because our country is bound to El Salvador by that kind of friendship, by that kind of mutual loyalty and common dedication to great principles and values, that I ask you all to stand to join with me in a Toast to the country of El Salvador and its President.
