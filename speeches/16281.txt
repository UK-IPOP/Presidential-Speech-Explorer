 October 11, 1948, is the one hundred and sixty-ninth anniversary of the death of Count Casimir Pulaski, son of a foreign nation, who gave his life for the cause of American freedom; and
 his death from a wound received while leading the celebrated Pulaski Legion at the siege of Savannah, in 1779, brought to a heroic end, at the youthful age of 31 years, a life which had given promise of further glorious achievements on behalf of humankind; and
 this distinguished Pole who achieved the rank of Brigadier General in the American Revolutionary Army bequeathed to all liberty-loving people a tradition of fidelity to principle which remains an inspiration to our own generation:
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Monday, October 11, 1948, as General Pulaski's Memorial Day. I call upon officials of the Government to display the flag on Government buildings on that day, and I invite the people of the United States to participate in the observance of the day with appropriate ceremonies in schools, churches, or other suitable place.
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
 at the city of Washington this 20th day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-third.

HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
ROBERT A. LOVETT,

Acting Secretary of State.
