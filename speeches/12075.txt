 certain public lands contiguous to the Dinosaur National Monument, established by Proclamation of October 4, 1915, have situated thereon various objects of historic and scientific interest; and
 it appears that it would be in the public interest to reserve such lands as an addition to the said Dinosaur National Monument:
 President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by sec. 2 of the act of June 8, 1906, ch. 3060, 34 Stat. 225 (U.S.C., title 16, sec. 431), do proclaim that, subject to all valid existing rights, the following-described lands in Colorado and Utah are hereby reserved from all forms of appropriation under the public-land laws and added to and made a part of the Dinosaur National Monument:
