IT IS a very great pleasure to me this morning to welcome the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury--and I have already welcomed the Secretary of Defense-from a most successful conference.
I think we have accomplished in the last few days in London, Paris, and Lisbon the things we have been working for for the last 3 or 4 years.
It is indeed a high privilege of mine to congratulate the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury on the job they have accomplished.
