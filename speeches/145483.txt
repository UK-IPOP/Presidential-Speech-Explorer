Pool Reports by 
, 
Hello from a chilly Wilmington.
The pool, tested and swept, joined the president's motorcade at 4:59 pm near the residence and we are now rolling.
So far your pooler has not laid eyes on the president today.
The motorcade arrived at St Joseph on the Brandywine at 5:02 PM.
Your pooler caught a glimpse of the president walking and chatting with what someone who could be a family member.
I am asking for more details.
Poll now holding next to the church.
Per the WH the president is attending mass with his daughter Ashley Biden
POTUS exited the church at 6 PM. Before leaving he spent a few minutes chatting with parishioners.
Your pool could see him hugging one woman and also having a conversation with a kid.
The president then walked back to his car with his daughter Ashley and the motorcade started rolling at 6:06 PM.
It arrived at the president's residence at 6:12 PM.
The WH gave us a lid at 6:30 PM.
Enjoy your evening!
