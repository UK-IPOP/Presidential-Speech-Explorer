GOVERNOR, it has been a pleasure to have you and the Senator here and have you meet all the staff, and to see the White House that you will occupy after the 4th--the 20th day of January--I almost gave you 2 months there.
The meeting has been very satisfactory from my viewpoint. We have discussed various things. The details will be worked out at a later date, but I think we are both happy and satisfied that the meeting took place. I am sure that I am.
