Senator John F. Kennedy announced today the appointment of Gov. Leroy Collins of Florida as chairman of the National Speakers Committee of the national Democratic campaign.
Governor Collins' role will be to coordinate the activities of speakers throughout the country as well as to make a number of campaign speeches himself.
Serving with Governor Collins will be Congressman John Moss, of California, Representative from California's Third District.
Senator Kennedy said he was-

  delighted that Governor Collins has accepted this very important task in our national campaign. In this job Governor Collins will coordinate the voice of the Democratic Party throughout the country, a job for which he is eloquently fitted as millions throughout the country saw during the Democratic National Convention when he served as permanent chairman for that convention.
This is one of the top jobs in our national campaign and one to which I am sure Governor Collins will bring his great talents and abilities.
In addition, Senator Kennedy said:
We are very fortunate to have Congressman John Moss working with Governor Collins on this project. Congressman Moss has performed an outstanding public service as chairman of the House Subcommittee Investigating Secrecy in Government. He is one of the truly outstanding young leaders of the Democratic Party in the West.
The headquarters for the National Speakers Committee will be located in Washington, D.C. The executive secretary of the committee is Kathryn Folger.
