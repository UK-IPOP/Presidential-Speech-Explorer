 â€” Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann released a new web video today titled "No to Obamacare and Perrycare" in which she takes a stand against the abuse of executive power and crony capitalism. The video highlights her specific opposition to individual mandates in Obamacare and Governor Rick Perry's executive order for a mandate requiring 12-year-old girls to take the HPV vaccine.
"Whether it's Obamacare or Perrycare, I oppose any governor or president who mandates a family's healthcare choices," Bachmann states in the video. "Especially if the decision-making process occurs behind closed doors, bypassing legislative action, and favors campaign contributors over families."
