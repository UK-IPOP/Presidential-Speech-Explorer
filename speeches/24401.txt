THE REORGANIZATION plan transferring the Water Pollution Control Administration from the Department of HEW to the Department of the Interior became effective today.
The Congress has acted wisely in permitting this reorganization plan to become effective.
Under the leadership of Secretary Udall, the Government is now better organized to carry out concerted action against the pollution that blights America's waters.
I deeply appreciate the support of Congress in this vital matter of streamlining the Government organization to fight pollution effectively.
