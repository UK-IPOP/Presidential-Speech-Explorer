A year ago today I wrote you of my desire to improve the Federal Government's employee safety programs.
At that time I issued a Safety Policy for the Federal Service and initiated Mission SAFETY-70 to achieve a 30 percent reduction in each agency's work injuries and costs by 1970.
Your reports to me last spring set forth your plans to meet our long-range objective to reduce the waste in manpower and materials arising from accidents.
I should now like to receive by May 1, 1966, from the head of each executive department and agency a summary report of developments in 1965.
This Mission SAFETY-70 report should include:

(a) actions taken;

(b) specific accomplishments;

(c) areas of weakness which still need strengthening;

(d) agency plans for 1966.
I appreciate that steps have been taken in the past year to strengthen the government's safety programs but much more must be undertaken to emphasize our continuing concern and to assure effective implementation.
