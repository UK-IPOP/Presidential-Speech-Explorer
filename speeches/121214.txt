(New York, NY) July 23, 2015 â€” Today, Donald J. Trump, announced the formation of the "Veterans for Trump" Coalition in New Hampshire. These veterans have pledged their support to Mr. Trump in the primary, and they will be advocating for him among other veterans and military families in New Hampshire, where there continues to be overwhelming support for Mr. Trump.
Mr. Trump stated, "Our Veterans are incredibly important and I'm proud to have the support of this coalition, especially in New Hampshire, where if I am elected I will build a full-service, first-class VA hospital to ensure all New Hampshire Veterans received the care they deserve. I love all Veterans and will help them finally lead the kind of lives that they should be leading."
The Trump for President Veteran's Coalition's co-chairs are: Rep. Werner Horn of Franklin, Rep. Dan Tamburello of Londonderry, Rep. Joe Pitre of Farmington and Jerry Delemus of Rochester.
Dan Tamburello of the Marine Corps said, "I believe that Donald Trump has the leadership, the will, the courage, and the unabashed love-of country Americans so desperately crave in the White House. We have some very serious issues facing this country that are going to take a steely-eyed, proven, tough leader to overcome. Furthermore, should Mr. Trump find his way into the White House, he won't owe anything to anyone except the American people. Mr. Trump is a Patriot who loves his country, the American people, and cares about America being respected and great again. I believe he has what it takes to restore the faith of America's allies and be respected by our enemies once more."
In addition to forming the New Hampshire Veterans Coalition, earlier this week Mr. Trump established a hotline (855- VETS- 352) and email address (
) for Veterans to share their stories about the need to reform our Veterans Administration.
If he is elected President he will take care of these and all Veteran complaints very quickly and efficiently.
