 "On the presidential campaign trail, Romney brags about a $3 billion budget shortfall he said he closed as governor, without any tax increases. He doesn't mention the more than $400 million in fees he raised instead. He also raised more than $300 million by closing so-called corporate loopholes, a revenue-raising measure the business community calls a tax increase." (Joan Vennochi, Op-Ed, "Mitt's No-Tax Mirage,"

 "[I]n his first year in office, the state increased hundreds of fees, making it more expensive to get a driver's license, marry, or buy a house. Those changes, which he defends as limited in scope and long overdue, brought in an additional $260 million. The new governor also collected an additional $255 million from businesses by closing what he called tax loopholes." (Scott S. Greenberger, "Romney Often Casts Himself As Budget Hero,"

 "Revenue Commissioner Alan LeBovidge said yesterday that Romney has asked him to scour the tax code in search of provisions that can be tightened to bring in moremoney, but he argued that it isn't accurate to refer to the proposed changes as tax increases."

 "[Romney] collected an additional $345 million from businesses during his first two years in office by closing what he called loopholes in the corporate tax code. This year, the governor initially proposed changes worth an additional $170 million, but he halved that figure in March in response to an uproar from businesses and their lobbying groups." (Scott S.

 "LeBovidge defended the changes as a way to crack down on companies that 'push the envelope.' ...Â  'I view it as people paying their fair share,' LeBovidge said. 'It's all about equity.'" (Scott S. Greenberger, "Governor's Fiscal Plan Targets Tax 'Loopholes,'"
