THE PRESIDENT. I want to express to you my appreciation for your willingness to undertake this trip to Iran. It is a very important job that you have undertaken, and one which I think you can handle with satisfaction and success.
All of us want to wish you a pleasant trip, and I hope that you will express to the Iranian Government that our interest is the interest of world peace, and the welfare of Iran and the rest of the world.
We have no selfish interest in the matter whatever.
