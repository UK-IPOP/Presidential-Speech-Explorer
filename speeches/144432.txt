Does it make sense to attack the servers that are used to carry out these ransom attacks in Russia?
 To attack them?
Well——
 Well, what happened was there was one company that got—I mean, they weren't specifically attacking servers; they were attacking businesses.
I mean the U.S. response. Up until now, the U.S. response has been to exercise sanctions—impose sanctions on Russia for this malign activity. Does it make sense for the U.S. to take it up a notch and attack the actual servers that are used?
 Yes.
Sir, what are the consequences for Putin if he does not step up against cyber attacks?
 Well, we set up a committee—joint committee. They're meeting on, I think, the 16th. And I believe we're going to get some cooperation.
Thank you.

 It's not appropriate for me to say what I expect him to do now. But we'll see.
Thank you.
