Motorcade arrived at Onondaga Community College at 2:45pm.
Passed what appeared to be two schools with young children standing outside and waving. The first school had the children lined up on the sidewalk with American flags and hand drawn welcome signs.
Hundreds of other people stood outside and took photos and waved at the motorcade throughout the trip.
One man, wearing a 'Let's go Brandon' shirt stood outside with a 'FJB' sign. Another group had a huge banner that read 'Hunter Biden is the most privileged and protected person in America' and another group held negative signs with one reading 'you suck.'
At Onondaga Community College, Biden is participating in a tour of Micron Pavilion, led by Micron President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra, and President of Central & Northern New York Trades Council, Greg Lancette.

The tour started 2:52pm.
Biden was introduced to an Air Force veteran, who went to Syracuse and works at Micron.
"Me too," Biden said about Syracuse.
Biden looked at a replica of the future Micron semiconductor facility.
"It's good it's coming home because we invented the suckers," he said, which Gillibrand laughed at.
Biden added, "Pretty good, man" and said that the facility will bring "Incredibly good salaries."
The group was then brought over to look at fabrication equipment.
Pool was ushered out of the room at 3:01pm. We are holding in the room where Biden will deliver his remarks.
