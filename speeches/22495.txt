THE PRESIDENT has instructed William C. Foster, Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, to lead the U.S. delegation to the 18-nation Disarmament Conference at Geneva when discussions resume on January 21.
In so doing, the President said that he views the negotiations as one of the most important way stations in this Nation's priority efforts to strengthen the peace.
He said that as the United States enters these negotiations in a new year, we harbor no illusions of quick or easy success. But he said we do take encouragement from developments in the recent past and look to new opportunities in this Nation's search for agreement on sound and significant arms limitation and reduction measures.
He told Mr. Foster that he will take a deep and continuing personal interest in the negotiations as they proceed.
