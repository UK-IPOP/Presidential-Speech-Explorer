Dear Mr. President:
On behalf of the government of the United States of America, I wish to extend my warm congratulations on your inauguration as President of the Syrian Arab Republic. The people of the United States, who have traditionally held the Syrian people in the highest esteem, join with me in wishing you and your administration well. It is my earnest hope that during the exercise of your office we will have close official and personal relations looking toward the strengthening of ties between our two nations.
JOHN F. KENNEDY
