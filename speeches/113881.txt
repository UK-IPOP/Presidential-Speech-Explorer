 "Against that backdrop, Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin stepped onto likely his biggest stage yet on Thursday night and showed an American electorate still getting to know the Republican vice presidential nominee that he is no pushover." (

 "If Mr. Biden was sometimes openly emotional, a hot on-screen presence, Mr. Ryan, 27 years his junior, was cooler, often coming off as confident, and fluent in the policy underlying his arguments." (

 "In a debate without much news or many breakthrough moments, Biden's overheated style is almost sure to be the media, late-night laugher, and conservative takeaway from the ninety minutes. ... Democratic partisans will say he fought hard and schooled Ryan on every topic; many others will find his an odd, off-putting performance, far too lacking in the many attractive aspects of Biden's personality. ... Obama can borrow a few elements of Biden's performance, but the over-the-top aggressiveness won't be seen again on the Democratic side in the remaining two debates." (

 "Last night Mr. Biden was weirdly aggressive, if that is the right word for someone who grimaces, laughs derisively, interrupts, hectors, rolls his eyes, browbeats and attempts to bully. He meant to dominate, to seem strong and no-nonsense. Sometimes he did—he had his moments. But he was also disrespectful and full of bluster. ... I have just realized the problem with the debate: it was the weird distance between style and content, and the degree to which Mr. Biden's style poisoned his content." (

 "Vice President Joe Biden did give the president what he needed last night — a jolt of energy and a strong defense — but his constant smiling and guffawing could overshadow his performance and turn off undecided voters." (

 "But the smirking from the Democratic vice presidential candidate might turn off some voters in Iowa, where polling has shown he has a likability gap, politics analysts here said." (

 "I thought it was unattractive, I thought it was rude and I have a feeling it will come across to an awful lot of people as rude." (Fox News, 10/12/12)
