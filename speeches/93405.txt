 "Romney maintains that as governor of Massachusetts, he had an 'aggressive' and 'clear' stance against illegal immigration. 'I vetoed a bill that would have given tuition breaks to illegal aliens. I insisted that we not give driver's licenses to illegal aliens,' Romney said, 'and I authorized our state police to enforce federal immigration laws.'" (O.

 "Governor Mitt Romney and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Assistant Secretary Julie L.

 NBC's TIM RUSSERT: "Senator Clinton, I just want to make sure what I heard. Do you, the New York Senator Hillary Clinton, support the New York governor's plan to give illegal immigrants a driver's license?" ... SEN. HILLARY CLINTON: "You know, Tim, this is where everybody plays gotcha. It makes a lot of sense."
 "'Senator Clinton supports governors like Governor Spitzer who believe they need such a measure to deal with the crisis caused by this administration's failure to pass comprehensive immigration reform,' her campaign said in a statement."

 MSNBC's TIM RUSSERT: "Senator Clinton, would you allow the sanctuary cities to exist?" SEN. CLINTON: "Well, in addition to the general points that have been made, that I agree with, why do they have sanctuary cities? In large measure because if local law enforcement begins to act like immigration enforcement officers, what that means is that you will have people not reporting crimes. You will have people hiding from the police. And I think that is a real direct threat to the personal safety and security of all the citizens. 
" (MSNBC Democratic Presidential Debate, Dartmouth, NH, 9/26/07)
 RUSSERT: "But you would allow the sanctuary cities to disobey the federal law." SEN. CLINTON: "Well, I don't think there is any choice. The ICE groups go in and raid individuals, but if you're a local police chief and you're trying to solve a crime that you know people from the immigrant community have information about, they may not talk to you if they think you're also going to be enforcing the immigration laws."

 "Responsibility for stopping illegal immigration belongs to the federal government and not to cities, states or businesses, Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani said Tuesday. Giuliani told small-business owners he would not punish them for unwittingly hiring illegal immigrants. Federal officials are 'trying to put the responsibility for this on employers, on city government, on state government,' the former New York mayor said during a conference call arranged by the National Federation of Independent Businesses. 'The simple fact is, nobody but the federal government can stop people from coming into this country illegally, and the federal government does a very bad job of that,' Giuliani said."

 "'The reality is that they are here, and they're going to remain here,' Mr. Giuliani said of the children. 'The choice becomes for a city what do you do? Allow them to stay on the streets or allow them to be educated? The preferred choice from the point of view of New York City is to be educated.'" (Eric Schmitt, "Giuliani Criticizes G.O.P.
