Hello from the White House. I'll be your print pooler today.
The only on camera appearance by the president is expected to be at the briefing of the coronavirus task force, which is currently scheduled for 5 p.m.
For those of you not attending the briefing today, feel free to send questions my way, and I'll try to ask some of them.
A lunch lid has been called until 2:30 p.m.
Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deere passes along the following:
Yesterday, President Donald J. Trump spoke by phone with Governor Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma to commemorate 25 years since the Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995 where 168 were tragically killed, including 19 children. President Trump offered his full support for the victims and their families who still grieve for the loss of their loved ones. The President and the Governor also discussed the Federal-State partnership and response to COVID-19. The President praised the work of Governor Stitt, local officials, and all Oklahomans to slow the spread and keep numbers low. The Governor thanked the President for his attention to Oklahoma and pledged to continue to be a good partner with the Administration.
According to a tweet from the president, today's coronavirus task force briefing is now scheduled for 5:30 p.m.
I'll let you know if that is delayed. Otherwise, I will provide color that you can't see on TV.
