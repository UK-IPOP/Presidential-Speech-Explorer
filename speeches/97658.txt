ARLINGTON, VA -- Today, the Obama-Biden campaign has outlined their fourth tax plan in just four days. Now they are saying that those making between $150,000 and $250,000 would not see their taxes increase or receive a tax cut. Under that formulation, is Barack Obama still giving a tax cut to 95% of American people? Has Barack Obama been giving the American people straight talk on the campaign trail when he says if they make less than $250,000 a year they would receive a tax cut? Check out below Barack Obama's ever-changing tax plans:
 (Barack Obama, Remarks, Powder Springs, GA, 7/8/08)
 FURMAN: "Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the op-ed today makes a very important point that, while Barack Obama would not raise taxes for any family making below $250,000 -- in fact, it would cut taxes for almost all of the families making less than that -- Senator McCain cannot make a similar promise for his tax plan because, for the first time in history, he would make families pay taxes on the health insurance that they get from their employers." (Obama For American, Press Conference Call, 8/14/08)
 "He'll restore the middle class by cutting taxes for small businesses, and for 95 percent of workers and their families, including 5.7 million in Ohio. If you make less than $250,000, you won't see your taxes go up one single dime. In fact, your tax rates will be lower than they were under Ronald Reagan." (Governor Ted Strickland, Democratic Radio Response, 10/4/08)

 "Spreading the wealth was not--he was talking about is all of the tax breaks have gone to the very, very wealthy. For example you have right now, this year, under the old tax policy that was just that was put in by George Bush, people making an average 1.4 million a year, good people, decent people, patriotic they're going to get an $87 billion tax break. What we're saying is that $87 billion tax break doesn't need to go to people making an average of 1.4 million, it should go like it used to. It should go to middle class people -- people making under $150,000 a year." (Joe Biden, Interview With WNEP Scranton, 10/27/08)
