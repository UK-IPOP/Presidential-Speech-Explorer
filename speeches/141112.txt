President Donald J. Trump today released a list of twenty additional names he will consider nominating as U.S. Supreme Court justices should vacancies occur on the high court in the coming months or in a second term. President Trump released a similar well-received list during the 2016 campaign because voters deserve a clear understanding of a candidate's vision of the direction of the Supreme Court. With the President's list of candidates now public, the Trump campaign called on Joe Biden to do the same and release his own list of prospective nominees.
"President Trump has a stellar record of appointing more than 200 solid, conservative federal judges, including two strong Supreme Court justices, and will likely get to 300 judges by the end of his first term," said 
"Voters deserve transparency and a clear view of what direction candidates for president would take our federal courts. We now forcefully demand that Joe Biden do the same."
"We must have justices who apply the Constitution and not make their own policies on so many important issues. That's why it's key that President Trump has released this list, because voters deserve the clarity and transparency of exactly where the priorities will be," said 
 "It is imperative that Joe Biden follow the President's lead and release his own list and tell Americans where he stands, and what kind of justices he will pick."
The next president may have the opportunity to nominate multiple justices to the Supreme Court. Joe Biden must declare what kind of judges he would select, as the nation will face key questions on fundamental issues of immense importance in the coming years.
Will Joe Biden's Supreme Court nominees:
"President Trump has been the best president the pro-life movement has ever had, and we are again thrilled to see his list of potential Supreme Court selections. A nation can be measured by how it protects the most vulnerable, and a Supreme Court which protects the unborn is of paramount importance," said 
"We know that Joe Biden would select activist judges who bow to the wishes of the abortion industry. For this and many other reasons, President Trump is the obvious choice in November."
"The Founders of our nation thought so much of the right of people to defend themselves that they enshrined it in our Constitution. President Trump has always stood for the 2nd Amendment and his judicial selections will reflect that view," said 
"We know that the forces who control Joe Biden will attack those rights and leave Americans defenseless. On 2nd Amendment rights, Supreme Court justices are extremely important, and President Trump has our back."
"The 1st Amendment guarantees freedom 
 religion, but it does not require there be freedom 
 religion. People must have the right to worship according to their own beliefs, and President Trump has been a true champion of those freedoms," said 
. "Now more than ever, with the unrelenting onslaught of the left, we must have Supreme Court justices who understand that people are born with the right to practice religion in their lives. Joe Biden and his leftist allies stand against those rights and cannot be allowed to appoint liberal activist judges to the court."
"This list reflects President Trump's commitment to the American people to promote judges who respect our national sovereignty and upholds the President's right to defend our borders," said 
. "These names reflect President Trump's deep commitment to protecting our constitutional rights - especially our 2nd Amendment rights which are under assault from the Biden-Harris wing of the Democrat party."
"In only four years President Trump has transformed the federal judiciary, and this list again demonstrates his commitment to those who want confidence that the Supreme Court will uphold our God-given liberties," said 
. "The President is doubling down on his pledge to appoint justices who demonstrate a faithful commitment to the Constitution and the rule of law, thereby ensuring proper limits on the size of government and ending regulatory overreach."
"President Trump's list of Supreme Court nominees shows once again his firm commitment to protecting our fundamental rights, including religious freedom and the right to life for every precious unborn child. Originalist judges are necessary to protect and preserve our constitutional republic, built on the truthful recognition that our rights are God-given, not government-given," said 
. "President Trump has fulfilled his promise to appoint originalist judges who are the guardians of our rights and freedoms for the next half century of American jurisprudence. Joe Biden would fill the bench with activists and socialists who would give government increasing power and trample our rights. We must re-elect President Trump to continue safeguarding our rights, especially on the High Court."
