 – Over 5,000 women across the state have publicly declared their support for Hillary Clinton. This outpouring of support comes as the campaign hosts a Women for Hillary phone bank in the campaign's Portland office on Wednesday.
"I am honored to have the support of so many women from throughout Oregon," said Senator Hillary Clinton. "I am proud to have fought for women's rights and working families for the last 35 years, and I will continue that fight in White House."
