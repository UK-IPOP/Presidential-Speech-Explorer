Today at the Leon Sullivan Summit in Washington D.C., the President will announce a doubling of funds for the African Education Initiative announced last July, bringing our total spending to $200 million over the next 5 years.
African children are the future of the continent. Their education is key to future economic growth and lasting democracy, leading to greater stability and improved standards of living. The current state of education in Africa, however, is plagued by a lack of funds, teachers, textbooks, and transparency. Consider:
The multi-year basic education initiative, 
, provides needed training and materials to both teachers and students. With this additional funding, many African students will receive textbooks written in their local language and girls will receive scholarships covering the cost of tuition. Likewise, new and existing teachers will receive the needed training to educate children more effectively.
