The president’s public schedule is empty today.
The White House says the press briefing with deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, originally scheduled for 12:30 p.m., is now scheduled for 1 p.m.
The White House says the briefing has now been pushed back to 1:15 p.m.
We have a two-minute warning for the press briefing.
Principal Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre is handling today’s briefing. She will be only the second Black woman to lead a press briefing, and the first in roughly three decades. (Judy Smith, the deputy press secretary in the George H.W. Bush administration and the inspiration for the Olivia Pope character on Scandal, was the first.)
The press briefing ended at 2:21 p.m.
Passing along this on background update from the White House:
"The President has been briefed on the mass shooting and the tragic loss of life in San Jose by his Homeland Security Advisor, Liz Sherwood-Randall. The White House continues to monitor the situation and remains in close contact with local officials to offer any assistance as needed."
The White House called a lid at 3:37 p.m. Have a good day, everyone.
