IN MARCH 1948, at the first meeting of the National Capital Sesquicentennial Commission, which was created by Congress to plan the celebration of the 150th birthday anniversary of our Nation's Capital, I said: "It is a matter of importance to all citizens of the United States and a symbol to freedom loving people everywhere." That statement has even more pertinent application now than a year ago.
The Commission, under the authority granted to it by the Congress, has created a sound program for the observance of this important event in our American history-one which I believe will bring home to every American, and to the world, the full significance of our great heritage of freedom.
I believe the exposition planned by the Commission offers a timely opportunity for all elements of our national life to demonstrate the achievements of our free enterprise system, on a site in the heart of the Capital. I hope that all our States and Territories, industry, labor, and all Government agencies and departments will respond wholeheartedly to our invitation to participate.
I can think of no more appropriate name for this important celebration than the Freedom Fair--and I urge all Americans to help in making it a symbol of America's faith in the democratic principles upon which our Nation was rounded.
