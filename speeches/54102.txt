The Senate version of the omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1990 produces budgetary savings that are generally consistent with the Bipartisan Budget Summit Agreement. However, the President's senior advisors would recommend that the President veto the bill if it includes either of the following provisions.

— A labor protection provision establishing fixed procedures and protections for resolving certain labor conflicts; resolution of these conflicts should be left to collective bargaining or other labor/manageaent negotiations.

— Provisions changing landing and take-off rights at three airports subject to the High Density Rule; these provisions would enormously disrupt domestic passenger air travel and would eliminate the use of market forces for the exchange of landing and take-off rights.

— Federally mandated actions on aviation noise would unduly interfere with local airport authority decisionmaking. This does not balance the widely varying interests of concerned groups.

Unless the version of the bill that is presented to the President for signature is amended to address these concerns, the President's senior advisors would recommend that the bill be vetoed. 
In addition, the Administration has serious concerns about several other provisions in the Senate bill, including but not limited to the following:

. The Administration will continue to work with the Senate to make the language of the Senate amendment on budget process reforms more consistent with the Bipartisan Budget Summit Agreement.
