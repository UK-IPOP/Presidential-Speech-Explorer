Fellow workers: I first want to say to you that I never felt better in my life. I congratulate you in being a part of the greatest crusade of this century. And that the principles for which we have fought will prevail is as sure as that the truth will always prevail.
And I hope that none of you are either afraid or disheartened because I am not in the slightest.
I just wanted to come down and thank you so much for being my fellow fighters in this struggle—to say hello to you—before going back to my room just now.
I hear some people shouting to me, "Don't give up." I guess those people don't know me. I must be going back upstairs, but I did want to come by to thank you and thank you from the bottom of my heart. Don't be afraid and never quit. Good night.
