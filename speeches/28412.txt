President Suharto, Mrs. Suharto, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen:
Mr. President, we welcome you very warmly to the White House and to Washington on this occasion, your first visit to the United States.
We welcome you first because you come from a great country, a new country, but the third most populous nation in all the free nations of the world.
We welcome you secondly because of the leadership you have provided for your country, leadership which is devoted toward producing that progress which will go to the people of the country and not just to its leaders.
We welcome you also because of the role you and your government have played and are continuing to play for peace in the Pacific. The recent conference at Djakarta
--a conference which was a splendid example of Asian nations attempting to find solutions for Asian problems---this conference is one that we have noted, and we know that it will contribute to the cause of peace and security for all nations in the Asian area.
The Djakarta Conference of Foreign Ministers of 11 Asian nations was held on May 16 and 17, 1970, at the invitation of president Suharto.
Finally, Mr. President, we welcome you because we know that the slogan of your country is "Unity in Diversity," which is somewhat similar to the slogan of our country. As we think of the world in which we live, a world of different peoples, different races, different religions, different philosophies, we realize that we cannot find answers to all the differences. We will not always be all the same, not either among peoples or nations or within a nation, but we can be unified on those great principles that really matter--the right of all people to be free, the right of all people to be independent of foreign domination, and the right of all people to live in peace.
Unity in diversity--on these great principles the people of Indonesia, the people of the United States, I believe all the peoples of the world, are truly united. We welcome you most warmly.
