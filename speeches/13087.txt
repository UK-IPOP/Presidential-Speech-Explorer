Dear :
A Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee recently has been studying the matter of physical disability retirements. On January 29, 1948, the Secretary of Defense expressed his views concerning the need for revision of statutes governing retirement for physical disability of personnel in the Armed Services in a letter addressed to. the Honorable Charles H. Elston, Chairman of the Subcommittee.
This is a subject which I have discussed with Secretary Forrestal on several occasions. I agree with him that the present statutes should be revised along the lines suggested in his letter to Mr. Elston. I hope that the Armed Services Committees will develop the needed corrective legislation for action by the Congress during the present session.
Secretary Forrestal is thoroughly acquainted with my views on the matter. I have asked him to act as my representative and to work in conjunction with your Committee and with the other appropriate committees of the Congress.

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
