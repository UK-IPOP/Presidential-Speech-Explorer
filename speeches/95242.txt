 "She also has an economic stimulus plan, including tax rebates for working- and middle-class families, that could help jump-start our sluggish economy, which is in danger of heading into a recession." [Las Vegas Sun,1/18/07]
 "Last week Hillary Clinton offered a broadly similar but somewhat larger proposal. (It also includes aid to families having trouble paying heating bills, which seems like a clever way to put cash in the hands of people likely to spend it.)" [New York Times, Paul Krugman, 1/14/08]

 Nobel Prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz said that a plan that keeps families in their homes "would stimulate the economy." [New York Times, 1/23/07]
Complete timeline here: 
Obama's package was released two days after Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, his chief rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, released an economic stimulus package of her own Friday. Obama has been accused of basing his appeal on optimistic speeches, without providing much of the details on how he would govern." [Newsday, 1/13/08]
 "During that time, Clinton beat Obama to the punch in proposing an economic stimulus package - a shrewd move that buttressed her assertion to be the candidate of substance. And she zeroed in on economic concerns just as the recent stock-market plunge highlighted the need for economic action. Obama unveiled his stimulus package a few days later, but garnered less attention for being second out of the gate." [Boston Globe, 1/20/08]

 Obama campaign's initial response to the latest wave of bad economic news was, I'm sorry to say, disreputable: Mr. Obama's top economic adviser claimed that the long-term tax-cut plan the candidate announced months ago is just what we need to keep the slump from "morphing into a drastic decline in consumer spending." Hmm: claiming that the candidate is all-seeing, and that a tax cut originally proposed for other reasons is also a recession-fighting measure - doesn't that sound familiar? [New York Times, Paul Krugman, 1/14/08]
 "Anyway, on Sunday Mr. Obama came out with a real stimulus plan. As was the case with his health care plan, which fell short of universal coverage, his stimulus proposal is similar to those of the other Democratic candidates, but tilted to the right. For example, the Obama plan appears to contain none of the alternative energy initiatives that are in both the Edwards and Clinton proposals, and emphasizes across-the-board tax cuts over both aid to the hardest-hit families and help for state and local governments. I know that Mr. Obama's supporters hate to hear this, but he really is less progressive than his rivals on matters of domestic policy." [New York Times, Paul Krugman, 1/14/08]
