I HAVE been informed that an agreement has been reached on all outstanding issues between the Government of Indonesia and the oil companies. I am much gratified and congratulate President Sukarno and his associates on this matter. The manner in which this problem has been resolved is in the best tradition of the spirit that has characterized relations between Indonesia and the United States.
