 Why Senator Rubio sir?
 Because any vote against Marco Rubio is a vote for Donald Trump and that would be a terrible thing for the Republican Party and ultimately the country. Trump's the only guy who has got higher negatives than Hillary Clinton. Marco Rubio is the one guy who can pull the party together.
