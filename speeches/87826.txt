 Since August 2003, more than 7.4 million jobs have been created - more jobs than the European Union and Japan combined. Over half a million jobs (513,000) have been added in the past three months alone. Our economy has now added jobs for 41 straight months, and the unemployment rate remains low at 4.6 percent.
 To help bring our economy out of a recession and recover from September 11th, the Administration cut taxes on everyone who pays income taxes, doubled the child tax credit, reduced the marriage penalty, cut taxes on small businesses, and cut taxes on dividends and capital gains. The President asks Congress to help keep our economy growing by making his tax relief permanent.
 On February 5, the President will submit a budget that will eliminate the deficit by 2012. To help set spending priorities, the President will work with Congress to cut the number and cost of all earmarks at least in half by the end of this session. He also believes Congress should enact a legislative line-item veto to help the legislative and executive branches work together to eliminate wasteful spending.
 America is the undisputed leader of today's global economy. The President discussed his agenda to keep our economy competitive and make it more flexible and dynamic by:
 The government has a responsibility to ensure our education system is preparing American workers to compete in an economy that increasingly rewards skills and education. The President asks Congress to reauthorize the No Child Left Behind Act that is getting results for our children and our economy. In addition, the President's American Competitiveness Initiative seeks to improve math and science education in middle and high schools.
