 â€“The Cruz for President campaign today announced a new TV ad, "New York Values", showing Donald Trump's assertion that New York "views" and "attitudes" are different than views and attitudes in Iowa. Trump explained New York Values in his own words and how they shaped his views on gay marriage and abortion. He then admits that if he were president he would not even ban partial-birth abortions.
The ad will run statewide in Iowa beginning January 26.
