 In total, the President will announce nine members to serve on the Commission – including the two co-chairs.
 The Task Force will bring together top-level officials from the U.S. Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Labor, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, and Education, as well as the Office of Management and Budget and the Small Business Administration. It will identify and examine existing Federal services provided to returning Global War on Terror service members, identify gaps in these services, and seek recommendations from appropriate Federal agencies on ways to fill those gaps quickly and effectively.
 The group held its first meeting on March 1, 2007. It will identify any critical shortcomings and opportunities to improve care and quality of life for injured and sick members of the armed forces at WRAMC, NNMC, and other facilities if necessary, and make recommendations for corrective actions.
 All military members and families and retirees and families receive health care benefits from the Department of Defense (DoD). Military members on active duty are treated in DoD hospitals and clinics worldwide. A member severely harmed in combat is retained on active duty and treated in DoD facilities until he or she is granted lifetime DoD disability retirement and health benefits. The member may also transition to the VA health system for care.
 Overall, the President is asking Congress for more than $86 billion for veterans' services in 2008. If Congress approves his request, this would amount to a 77 percent increase since the President took office – the highest level of support for veterans in American history.
