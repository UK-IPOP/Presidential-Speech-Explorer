Republicans are holding middle class tax cuts hostage to borrow $700 billion to pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest 2% of earners. While they claim this effort is would help entrepreneurs and small businesses, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation,

 While Congressional Republicans' rhetoric would imply they are fighting for start-ups, mom-and-pop store owners and aspiring entrepreneurs, they count as "small businesses" making "small business income" any and all high income taxpayers with any type of partnership income, sole proprietor income, or S corporation income. Thus, under their definition, the following are all counted as small businesses:

The President has called on Congress to pass a strong Small Business Jobs Bill so that millions of small businesses can get the tax relief and access to credit that they need to expand, grow and hire. Included in the Small Business Jobs Bill are the following eight tax cuts:
1. 
 Under the Recovery Act, 75 percent of capital gains on key small business investments were excluded from taxes. The Senate Small Business Jobs Bill temporarily puts in place for 2010 a provision called for by the President – elimination of 
 capital gains taxes on these investments. 
2. 
 The bill temporarily increases for 2010 and 2011 the amount of investments in new plants or equipment that 
 would be eligible to 
immediately write off to $500,000 – its highest limit ever – while raising the level of investments at which the write-off phases out to $2 million.
3. 
 The bill extends through 2010– as the President proposed in his budget – a Recovery Act provision for 50 percent "bonus depreciation" for 
, providing them with incentives to invest in plants and equipment by accelerating the rate at which they can deduct capital expenditures.
4. 
 The bill would allow 
 to deduct the cost of health insurance in 2010 for themselves and their family members in calculating their self-employment taxes. This provision is estimated to provide over $1.9 billion in tax cuts for these entrepreneurs.
5. 
 The bill would change tax rules so that the use of cell phones can be deducted without burdensome extra documentation – making it easier 
to receive deductions that they are entitled to. 
6. 
 The bill would temporarily increase in 2010 the amount of start-up expenditures entrepreneurs can deduct from their taxes from $5,000 to $10,000 (with a phase-out threshold of $60,000 in expenditures), offering an immediate incentive for someone with a new business idea to invest in starting up a new small business.
7. 
 The bill would allow certain small businesses to "carry back" their general business credits to offset five years of taxes – providing them with an instant tax break – while also allowing these credits to offset the Alternative Minimum Tax, reducing taxes for these small businesses. 
8. 
 The bill would change the penalty for failing to report certain tax transactions from a fixed dollar amount – which was criticized for imposing a larger penalty on small businesses – to a percentage of the tax benefits from the transaction.
 With many creditworthy small businesses still struggling to get the credit they need to grow, the Small Business Jobs Bill would also:
•     Create a new $30 billion Small Business Lending Fund
•     Establish a State Small Business Credit Initiative to strengthen state programs that support private-sector lending to small businesses
•     Extend successful Recovery Act provisions raising SBA loan guarantees and eliminating fees
•     Double the maximum size of most SBA loans
