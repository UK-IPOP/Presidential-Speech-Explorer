 November 11, 1943, is the twenty-fifth anniversary of the signing of the Armistice with Germany which terminated hostilities at the close of the first World War; and
 Senate Concurrent Resolution 18 of the Sixty-ninth Congress, passed June 4, 1926 (44 Stat. 1982), requests the President of the United States to issue a proclamation calling for the observance of November 11 as Armistice Day; and
 we can best observe that day by rededicating ourselves, with the faith and loyalty of the men who fought and died for our cause during the first World War, to those tasks which are directed toward achieving victory in the present struggle:
, President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people of the United States to observe November 11, 1943, by devoting themselves whole-heartedly and with renewed fervor to every task that will contribute to the winning of the war; and I direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings on that day.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
 at the city of Washington this 29th day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-eighth.
FRANKLIN D ROOSEVELT
By the President:
