"On day one, President Romney will announce deficit reductions, ending the Obama era of big government. He will stand up to China on trade and demand they play by the rules, and he will start repealing the job-killing regulations that keep our economy down. Compare that to what the first day of President Obama's second term would look like. On day one of the Romney presidency, we will begin restoring the greatness of America." â€“ Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
