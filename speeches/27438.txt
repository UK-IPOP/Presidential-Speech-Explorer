MR. O'Connor and Governor Harriman do me a great honor by bringing the decision of the committee to me this morning.
Mrs. Johnson has just been here. We have looked over a portrait that is being presented to the White House collection of President Roosevelt. It will be officially presented tomorrow afternoon. We hope it will ultimately hang over the center of the fireplace.
This award is greatly appreciated by me. President Roosevelt was one of the great leaders of our country and one of my great leaders.
As a young man he stimulated my great interest in economic and political matters. I remember the first time I called on him in this room when I was a young secretary just becoming the NYA Administrator.
From that day until this moment, I have been a student of his thoughts, his hopes, his achievements, and have tried to in some small degree follow them and be guided by them.
He had no two greater friends in this world than Mr. O'Connor and Governor Harriman. I think it particularly appropriate that they should come on behalf of the committee to make this award.
I shall maintain an interest in the work of the committee as the years come and go. I want to express a deep gratitude for your thoughtfulness.
