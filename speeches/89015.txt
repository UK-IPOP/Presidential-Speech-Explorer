Washington, DC â€“ As Mrs. Elizabeth Edwards spoke at the Planned Parenthood Action Fund today about Senator John Edwards' commitment to improving the lives of women and families, numerous women leaders endorsed Senator Edwards for president. These leaders believe Edwards is the best candidate to put a Democrat back in the White House and protect women's rights. In May, the campaign launched Women for Edwards, 
 to organize women around the country who support Edwards.
