THE DEATH of King Paul of Greece is a matter of deep sorrow to me, a sorrow which I know is shared by the American people.
King Paul's reign covered a period of great trial and sacrifice for Greece. His steadfast devotion and unwavering faith in Greece and the Greek people provided leadership in times of strife, unrest, readjustment, and recovery. The example of personal integrity and unselfish dedication to duty which King Paul represented has served as an inspiration and source of strength to his people. The American people will miss a true friend.
My deepest sympathy goes out to the bereaved Queen, to the Royal Family, and to the people of Greece. May God bless King Constantine and may his father's memory give him courage and inspiration in facing the great responsibilities that lie before him.
