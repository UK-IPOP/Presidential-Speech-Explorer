"Fifty-three days after President Bush submitted his Iraq war emergency supplemental funding proposal, Democrats in Congress have not yet sent the President a bill he can sign. General Pace has made clear that there will be real consequences if we do not fund the troops by mid-April, and it is troubling that House Democrats have not even appointed conferees to resolve the differences between versions passed by the House and Senate. Instead of playing politics, Democrats should fund the troops with a bill that does not force retreat, handcuff our commanders, or contain billions of dollars in pork spending."
- White House Deputy Press Secretary Dana Perino, 3/30/07
 The President "took too long to send his financing request to Congress." (Carl Hulse and Jeff Zeleny, "Defying Bush, Senate Passes Iraq Spending Measure,"
