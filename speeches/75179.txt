 Mr. President, any thoughts about this first meeting? 
 First impression? It was a good first impression.
 I rest my case. [
] We're going to have a very good meeting, and I've been looking forward to this for a long period of time. We find we have a lot in common, and I'm so honored the President came here. I know it's inconvenient to travel such a long distance, Mr. President——
 We know about the very latest statements of President Bush in Warsaw, and that's a very good foundation for us to proceed.
 Thank you all.
