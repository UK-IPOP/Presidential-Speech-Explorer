"It is something we feel very positive about. I think it is the only way that you are ever going to get term limits, and the only way that you are ever going to get a balanced budget amendment," Rubio added.
Asked if he had concerns about opening up the Constitution to a convention, Rubio remarked, "I think you would have to limit the convention, and that is what they are proposing: a very limited convention on specific delineated issues that they would talk about — like term limits and a balanced budget amendment."
Rubio endorses Convention of States! Will the other GOP contenders support it as well?

Former GOP Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn, a supporter of the Convention of States Project, praised Rubio for his comments.
"Marco Rubio knows that the answers to American's lack of confidence in Washington can only be fixed through an Article V Convention of States, restoring power to the states and the people by limiting the scope and power in Washington; placing term limits on politicians, forcing honest accounting and balanced budgets," Coburn said. "He also knows that Washington will not fix itself."
