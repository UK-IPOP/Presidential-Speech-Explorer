I have been in close contact with the Red Cross, various relief administrations, emergency conservation officials and Army officers in Washington. They report that all Federal agencies are cooperating in prompt relief measures. I have allocated $2,500,000 to the Works Progress Administration for immediate emergency work in the affected areas.
