 Mr. President——
. Mr. President, your response to the Republicans' counteroffer?
. Mr. President, can you confirm that you're going to submit a $6 trillion budget?
 I beg your pardon.
Six trillion dollar budget, can you confirm the topline number?
 Well, we'll confirm that—that will all be distributed. And one of the things I want to tell you is that I haven't had a chance yet to go over the details of the counteroffer made by Capito. I'll be—we're going to meet sometime next week, and we'll see if we can move that. And I'll have more to say about that at the time.
 Are you going to be—[
]—Mr. President?
What do you expect to get from your review—your 90-day review on where the origins of the coronavirus were?
 If I knew that, I wouldn't ask for a 90-day review. I don't know.
What can they get that they haven't found in the last year?
Will you pledge to release it in full? Will you pledge to release the report in full after 90 days?
 Yes. That's—unless there's something I'm unaware of.

Sir, what do you think of the proposal? Is the proposal too small for you from the Republicans? What is your thought on it?
 I had a good conversation—very brief, but a good conversation—with Capito, the Senator. And I told her we would—she's going to contact me next week. I told her we have to finish this really soon. And there's another Republican group that also wants to talk.
And—but we're going to have to close this down soon.
 What—how——
