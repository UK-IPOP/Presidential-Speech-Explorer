Today, Romney for President, Romney Victory, and the Republican National Committee announced fundraising totals of over $111.6 million in August. The campaign, RNC and state party participants have approximately $168.5 million cash on hand.
Announcing the numbers, Romney Victory National Finance Chairman Spencer Zwick and RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said, "Americans are not better off than they were four years ago and they are looking for a change of leadership. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are offering bold solutions to our country's problems – that is why we are seeing such tremendous support from donors across the country. We will continue the hard work of raising the resources so that Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan can win in November, put in place their Plan for a Stronger Middle Class, and finally get the country back on the right track."
