 certain forest lands within the State of Louisiana have been or may hereafter be acquired by the United States of America under the authority of sections 6 and 7 of the act of March 1, 1911, ch. 186, 36 Stat. 961, as amended (U.S.C., title 16, secs. 515, 516); and
 it appears that it would be in the public interest to designate such lands as the Kisatchie National Forest:
, President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 24 of the act of March 3, 1891, ch. 561, 26 Stat. 1095, 1103, as amended (U.S.C., title 16, sec. 471), and by section 11 of the said act of March 1, 1911 (U.S.C., title 16, sec. 521), do proclaim that there are hereby reserved and set apart as the Kisatchie National Forest (consisting of the Catahoula, Evangeline, Kisatchie, and Vernon divisions) all lands of the United States within the areas shown on the diagrams hereto attached and made a part hereof, and that all lands therein which may hereafter be acquired by the United States under authority of the said act of March 1, 1911, as amended, shall upon their acquisition be reserved and administered as a part of the Kisatchie National Forest.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 3d day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-six and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixtieth.
