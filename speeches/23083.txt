I AM pleased to learn firsthand of the organization of this distinguished group of business and financial leaders. They will perform a useful public service in fostering a wider understanding of the national need for a prompt and substantial reduction in individual and corporate tax rates. They have shown a high sense of statesmanship by their voluntary expression of interest and concern for the economic well-being of our Nation.
I am well aware that they are not in accord with all the proposals for structural revisions in our tax law I have made to the Congress, but their action indicates a substantial area of commonly held views which is far more significant than the area of difference. This is evident in the Statement of Principles adopted by this group at their meeting today.
Their statement reflects underlying beliefs-which I fully share--that the present Federal tax structure inhibits incentives, discourages economic growth, and is partly responsible for the present high level of unemployment, and that careful expenditure control must accompany tax reductions.
