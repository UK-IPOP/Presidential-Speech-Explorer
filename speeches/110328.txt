 "Romney will likely also be eager to push the message that he was a governor who stood by a no-new-taxes pledge. That's mostly a myth. His first budget included no general tax increases but did include a $500 million increase in various fees. He later proposed$140 in business tax hikes through the closing of 'loopholes' in the tax code."

 "Fees and taxes have increased more than $700 million a year under Governor Mitt Romney and Lieutenant Governor Kerry Healey, a leading budget specialist said yesterday. Michael J. Widmer president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, which closely tracks state finances said the state has raised roughly $740 million to $750 million per year by increasing fees and corporate taxes gained from what the Romney administration describes as 'closing loopholes.'"

 "Foundation President Michael Widmer said several of Romney's policies while governor resulted in higher taxes, including local aid cuts, fee hikes and changes to corporate tax codes. 'I think it's a mixed record,' Widmer said. 'He faced a large shortfall in the budget when he came into office and I think one has to be realistic about the problem he faced, but at the same time saying that he didn't raise taxes is an incomplete picture.'"

 "[Barbara Anderson' Citizens for Limited Taxation] is planning a lawsuit to challenge some of the $500 million in hikes they say are tax increases disguised as fees. They include a boost in the gun permit fee from $25 to $100, and a new $3,000-a-year fee on nursing home 'self-payers,' or residents who are not on Medicaid."

 "Not in the lexicon of Governor Mitt Romney, who makes similar distinctions between raising taxes - bad - and raising fees - good. When it comes to business, the Romney administration is 'closing tax loopholes, not changing tax policy,' insists Robert Pozen, the governor's chief economic adviser. Call it whatever you like; Massachusetts business is not pleased about it. Hundred of businesses wrote letters protesting the corporate tax increases - no, make that corporate loophole closings - which Romney yesterday signed into law."

 "[B]usinesses aren't happy that Romney 'closed loopholes,' as he put it - or took away exemptions and effectively raised taxes on them. 'Since he took office, those loopholes have cost the business community close to $300 million, and there are more on the way, we're told,' said Brian Gilmore, executive vice president of Associated Industries of Massachusetts. 'Whether you call it a tax or a loophole, it's an increased cost of doing business.'" (Tom Benner, "Mitt: Big Plans, Mixed Reviews,"
