 the children of today will tomorrow shape the destiny of the world; and
 the spiritual, mental, and physical well-being of our children is essential to the enrichment of their growing years and to the strength of their maturity; and
 the Congress, by a joint resolution of May 18, 1928 (45 Stat. 617), authorized and requested the President of the United States to issue annually a proclamation setting apart May 1 as Child Health Day and calling for appropriate observance of that day; and
 Child Health Day is also a fitting time for the people of the United States to observe a Universal Children's Day, as recommended by a resolution of the United Nations General Assembly, and to salute the work which the United Nations, through its specialized agencies, and the United Nations Children's Fund are doing to build better health for the coming generations:
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Thursday, the first day of May 1958, as Child Health Day, and I invite all persons and all agencies and organizations interested in the welfare of children to use that day as an occasion for rededication to those objectives designed to protect and promote the healthy growth of all children.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this ninth day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-second.

DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:

JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
