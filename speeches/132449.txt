Mr. President, any reaction to London, the terror attack?

 No, it's a terrible thing, just keeps going and going. And we have to be very smart; we have to be very, very tough, which perhaps we're not nearly tough enough. But that is just an absolutely terrible thing. In fact, I'm going to call the Prime Minister right now.

Have you been briefed on any intelligence about the attack?

 Yes, I have, on numerous things happening, including North Korea.

. So I've been briefed, and I'm going in right now for the briefing. And I'm going to see Frank inside too.

What did you mean when you said that the Muslim ban had to be more specific?

 We have to be tougher, and we have to be smarter. Thank you.
