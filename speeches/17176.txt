Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen:
I think it a fortunate circumstance for me that this mission to Europe brought me again to your country which has such a long history of friendship with my own. This is a much more pleasant day than when I last visited you--that was in mid-January.
This trip takes me to Europe in a search for peace. With my colleagues at the Geneva Conference, I shall hope that the cause of peace can be advanced for all the world--that people like yours--like ours--like the thirteen nations that are with us in NATO--all the others can achieve a more tranquil life with freedom and with justice.
I think it a very great privilege that I have a chance here for a very brief period to talk with you about the problems that lie before us and which are common to our two countries.

Thank you very much.
