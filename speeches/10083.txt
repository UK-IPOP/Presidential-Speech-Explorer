 the Congress by Joint Resolution of May 18, 1928, requested the President of the United States to proclaim annually May 1 as Child Health Day; and
 the welfare of the Nation is vitally affected by the health of its children; and
 the promotion of the best physical and mental development of the children is an essential part of the social-health program of the Nation; and
 it is highly desirable that special consideration be given this matter in all parts of the Nation;
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim and designate the first day of May of this year as Child Health Day, and do urge all official and voluntary agencies and organizations and all individuals interested in child welfare to unite upon that day in the observance of such exercises as will result in a deeper realization by the people of the necessity for the protection and promotion of the health of the Nation's children and in greater, unified effort to improve the existing child-welfare program wherever it is found inadequate.
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 6th day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and fifty-eighth.
FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT
By the President:
