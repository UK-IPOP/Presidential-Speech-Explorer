 Governor Romney has outlined a comprehensive solution to the nation's health care ills that expands access to affordable, portable, quality, private health insurance. Rather than relying on a one-size-fits-all, government-run system, Governor Romney's plan recognizes the importance of the role that states can play in leading reform and the need for innovation in dealing with rising health care costs and the problem of the uninsured.
- 
 Governor Romney believes that by expanding and deregulating the private health insurance market, we can decrease costs and ensure that more Floridians have access to affordable, portable, quality, private health insurance.
- 
 More than 3.7 million people are uninsured. For those with insurance, the average annual individual health insurance premium is $2,949. In 2004 alone, more than $95.2 billion was spent on health care by people in Florida.
- 
 Governor Romney's plan institutes market-based reforms that will bring down the cost of health insurance for every Floridian. His plan also redirects existing government spending to help Florida's low-income uninsured acquire private health insurance.

 Our health care system is the best in the world, but Governor Romney believes we can make it even better while cutting health care costs for every American. Frivolous lawsuits make health care more expensive and force doctors to practice defensive medicine. And, many aspects of the health care system remain technologically backwards. Governor Romney will bring a true market dynamic to health care and lead medical liability reform that will both honor the rights of patients and respect the work of physicians.
