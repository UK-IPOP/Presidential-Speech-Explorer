MR. PRIME MINISTER, you do this land and this house great honor by your visit. Mrs. Johnson and I welcome you, Lady Douglas-Home, the foreign Secretary, Mrs. Butler, and other members of your party to the United States and to the White House.
This visit only continues a tradition that is both spacious and warm. Meetings between American Presidents and British Prime Ministers were first firmly established by our great President, franklin Roosevelt, and your legendary Prime Minister--and now our fellow American--Sir Winston Churchill.
No matter the political complexion of our two governments, this tradition has remained happily unbroken for more than a quarter of a century.
During these years we have had our differences, but these differences have passed away. They have passed away because of a very special reason: There is between our two countries the invisible chords of a mingled respect and understanding and affection, much as two brothers who may differ but whose ties are too strong to ever break.
So we meet today as Presidents and Prime Ministers of our two countries--as they have always met with friendship and high resolve to face our common problems and to try to settle them for the common good. Together our nations are secure. They are strong enough to win any fight, and we hope they are wise enough to prevent one. Together we search for tolerance, we search for hope, we search for peace.
In that spirit and with that aim, Mr. Prime Minister, we welcome you. We welcome you to this house and to this land, and may God bless our work together.
