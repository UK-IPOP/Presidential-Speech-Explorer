"Four years after promising Tampa he would create new jobs and repair the housing crisis, President Obama has delivered the exact opposite. His failed economic policies have left millions of Americans still struggling to find work and pay their mortgages. It's clear President Obama just hasn't lived up to his own promises. On Day One, Mitt Romney will take action to help the millions of Americans left behind in the Obama economy." â€“Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 "Before President Barack Obama arrives in Tampa today to rally as many as 3,000 people, he will make his case to Hispanic leaders in Orlando. ... The president will address the group at midday and then fly to Tampa for a campaign rally at about 4:15 p.m. at Hillsborough Community College's Dale Mabry campus. No more tickets are available for that event." (Adam C. Smith, "Before Rally In Tampa On Friday, President Barack Obama Will Address Hispanic Leaders,"

 OBAMA: "Now, more than ever, this campaign has to be about the problems facing the American people - because this is a moment of great uncertainty for America. The economic crisis we face is the worst since the Great Depression. Businesses large and small are finding it impossible to get loans, which means they can't buy new equipment, or hire new workers, or even make payroll for the workers they have." (President Barack Obama,

 OBAMA: "These are the steps that we must take - right now - to start getting our economy back on track. But we also need a new set of priorities to grow our economy and create jobs over the long-term." (President Barack Obama, 
, Tampa, FL, 10/20/08)
 OBAMA: "It's getting harder and harder to make the mortgage, or fill up your gas tank, or even keep the electricity on at the end of the month. At this rate, the question isn't just 'are you better off than you were four years ago?', it's 'are you better off than you were four weeks ago?'" (President Barack Obama, 
, Tampa, FL, 10/20/08)
 "If you have health insurance, the only thing that will change under my plan is that we will lower premiums. If you don't have health insurance, you'll be able to get the same kind of health insurance that Members of Congress get for themselves. And we'll invest in preventative care and new technology to finally lower the cost of health care for families, businesses, and the entire economy. That's the change we need." (President Barack Obama, 
, Tampa, FL, 10/20/08)
