My dear Mr. Kip:
I have just learned that despite the serious condition of your health you insisted upon being taken to the polls in order to cast your vote for me at the election last Fall and I want you to know of my appreciation. It is gratifying to have such evidence of confidence on the part of one who has seen so much of the growth and development of our country.
With best wishes,
Faithfully yours,
HERBERT HOOVER
