"Stopping irresponsible spending increases doesn't add to the deficit â€“ it cuts the deficit. And stopping irresponsible tax increases is good for taxpayers, good for the economy, and prevents more uncontrolled spending in the future. We are on the path to a balanced budget, and that's where we intend to stay."

 Congressional Democrats' budget calls for a massive spending spree, financed by even bigger tax increases.
 
 Tax receipts as a percentage of the economy are 18.8 percent, which is higher than all but six of the past 25 years and above the average of the past 40 years.
 
 The Administration has advocated fundamental tax reform that would include fixing the AMT.
 Since 2001, Congress has periodically "patched" exemption levels and credit rules to keep the number of AMT taxpayers roughly constant at about 4 million. Congressional Democrats' plan to impose a tax increase this year to "pay for" revenue that was never going to be collected is just a backdoor way to raise taxes on the American people.
