My dear Mr. Minister:
I regret exceedingly that your private affairs make it necessary for you to suspend for the present your contribution to public service.
In accepting your resignation I need mention but one great service which you have performed during your term of office in Ottawa--the building up of mutual understanding between our government and the great government to the North. By the cooperative spirit which you have been able to invoke with officials of both governments you have contributed in large part to the consummation of the great treaty for the development of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Waterway. It is a notable service, and one of which you may always be proud.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Hon. Hanford MacNider, American Minister to Canada, Care, State Department, Washington, D.C.]
