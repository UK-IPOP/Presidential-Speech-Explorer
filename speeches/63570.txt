 Mr. Secretary-General, will you accept the President's suggestions for reforms of the United Nations?
 Yes, certainly.
 Do you think he has a point?
 Yes.
 Mr. President, you referred to the new isolationists in your speech. Could you be more specific about who you might mean?
 What I've been saying for months now. I think you all know what I mean.
 Could you be specific, name who exactly you mean?

 No, I haven't.
