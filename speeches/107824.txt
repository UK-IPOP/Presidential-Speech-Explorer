AUSTIN - The Perry campaign today released a 30-second television advertisement entitled "Fox," which will air on Iowa broadcast and cable.
Announcer: "The fox guarding the henhouse is like asking a Congressman to fix Washington: bad idea."
"Their years in Congress left us with debt, bailouts."
"Congressmen get paid $174,000 a year. We get the bill."
"We need a solution."
Gov. Perry: "That's the reason I've called for a part-time Congress. Cut their pay in half, cut their time in Washington in half, cut their staff in half, send them home. Let them get a job like everybody else back home has."
"I'm Rick Perry, and I approve this message."
