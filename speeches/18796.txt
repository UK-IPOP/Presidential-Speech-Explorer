Mr. President and Members of this Congress:
I cannot remember when I have been more deeply touched by any gift or any award than the one which you just accorded to me. But I do assure you that I need no symbol or any memento to keep buried deep in my heart and mind the pleasures and the interests--and indeed the instruction--I have received here in Chile.
This visit will always be one of my cherished memories. To have this medal as a visible token of your affection is indeed something for which I thank you from the very bottom of my heart--not only on my own behalf, and of my associates, but indeed on behalf of all my countrymen.
Thank you.
