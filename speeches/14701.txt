 in time of war as in time of peace it continues to be our high responsibility to maintain proper standards of health and human welfare;

 in the midst of the necessities of war and the prevailing shortages of physicians and surgeons we may be tempted to neglect the constant watchfulness and the programs of popular education which are at present our one hope of preventing those tens of thousands of deaths from cancer which result each year from lack of early attention; and

 by Public Resolution 82, 75th Congress, approved March 28, 1938 (52 Stat. 148), the President is authorized and requested to issue annually a proclamation setting apart the month of April of each year as Cancer Control Month:

, President of the United States of America, do hereby set apart the month of April 1944 as Cancer Control Month and invite similar action on the part of the Governors of the several States, Territories, and possessions of the United States. I call upon the medical profession and upon all agencies, organizations, and individuals in a position to claim public attention, to disseminate knowledge of the early symptoms of cancer and to effect wide-spread publication of the facts about clinics and other health facilities for the control of cancer.

, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.

 at the city of Washington this 28th day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-eighth.

FRANKLIN D ROOSEVELT
