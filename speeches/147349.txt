. So do I. So do I.
 It's a good place for doing those things.
 I use to ski a lot too. I haven't skied in a while. It's beautiful.
 So it's very good to have you here. I believe we can really do important things in the world. Special time.
 Well, there's a lot to do. And I want to compliment you on stepping up as you did when you became Chancellor and moving in the way that you—had a great impact on the rest of Europe to move, particularly as it related to Ukraine.
And you're our—you're one of our fastest and closest allies in the world, and we got to make sure we have this—us all staying together. You know we're going to continue working on the economic challenges we face, but I think we can get through all this——
 Yes.
——and come out stronger.
 And the good message is that we all made it to stay united, which obviously Putin never expected.
 And that was in no small part because of you—no small part because of you. Seriously. Because there was a lot of discussion of whether or not, in the transition—well, how it was going to work. But you've done an incredible job. I want to thank you for it. Thank you, thank you.
We have to stay together——
 Yes.
——because Putin has been counting on, from the beginning, that somehow NATO would—and the G-7 would splinter. And—but we haven't, and we're not going to.
So we can't let this aggression take the form it has and get away with it.
So thank you.
 Thank you.
