It is with horror and deep regret that I learn of the assassination of Engelbert Dollfuss, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Chancellor of Austria. I extend through you to the Austrian people sincere sympathy in my own name and on behalf of my fellow countrymen.
Mrs. Roosevelt joins with me in expressing to Madame Dollfuss our deepest sympathy in this great sorrow which has come to her.
His Excellency,

Wilhelm Miklas,
President of the Confederation of Austria,

Vienna, Austria
