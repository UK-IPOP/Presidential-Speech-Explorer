 I am so pleased that upon the recommendations of the Secretary of State Designee Rice that Bob Zoellick has agreed to serve as Deputy Secretary of State upon confirmation by the Senate. Condi Rice and Bob Zoellick will form one of the really strong, capable foreign policy teams our country has ever had.
I've known Zoellick for a long time. He's a—he is a fine public servant. I asked him to serve as our trade minister, and he did a fantastic job. And as he departs to the State Department, upon Senate confirmation, I want to assure the American people this administration is committed to free trade. I look forward to finding a replacement for Bob Zoellick that will be able to carry on our desire to spread free trade around the world.
In the meantime, I look forward to a quick confirmation for Condi and Bob so they can go over to the State Department and carry on the foreign policy of this administration. Thank you all very much.
Thanks for serving.
 Thank you, Mr. President.
 Glad you're going to do it.
 Thanks.
 Mr. President——

 Thank you all. See you in Detroit.
