The SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:
I have the honor to transmit herewith to the House of Representatives a report of the Secretary of War, accompanying copies of surveys* made in pursuance of the acts of Congress passed the 30th of April, 1824, and the 2d of March, 1829, and to request that the House cause them to be laid before the Senate, as there are no duplicates prepared.
ANDREW JACKSON
