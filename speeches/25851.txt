I WAS ASKED yesterday and again this morning for the President's views on NPT.
The President has authorized me to issue the following statement in response to these questions:
The President has been increasingly concerned, since he submitted the nonproliferation treaty to the Senate last July, about the effects here and abroad of delaying ratification of the treaty. It is our strong hope that all nations will sign, ratify, and adhere to the terms of the nonproliferation treaty.
