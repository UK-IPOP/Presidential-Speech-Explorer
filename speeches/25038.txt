I HAVE been advised today by General Alvim, the Commander of the Inter-American Force, and Lieutenant General Palmer, the Deputy Commander of the Inter-American Force, that conditions in the Dominican Republic now permit further withdrawal of United States military personnel from the Inter-American Force. This recommendation has the concurrence of the special committee of the Organization of American States and Ambassador Bennett.
I am therefore ordering the withdrawal of two battalions of the 82d Airborne Division, totaling approximately 1,400 personnel.
