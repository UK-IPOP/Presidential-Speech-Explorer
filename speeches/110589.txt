"Senator Santorum now decries the obscene growth in federal spending and our national debt, but he was in Washington as this fiscal crisis grew — supporting billions in earmarks, repeatedly voting to raise the debt ceiling, and admitting that deficits no longer bothered him. Americans want a president who can offer solutions, not a lifelong politician who was part of the problem in the first place." —Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 SANTORUM: "[W]hat government is doing is getting bigger and bigger, spending enormous amounts of money, throwing us into immoral debt, crushing the business community in this country. And we need someone who can go out there and articulate a vision." (Rick Santorum, Remarks in Tulsa, OK, 2/9/12)

 "Confronted with projected deficits until fiscal 2007, senior GOP lawmakers are backing away from long-standing rhetoric about the government's duty to live within its means. 'I came to the House as a real deficit hawk, but I am no longer a deficit hawk,' said Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.). 'I'll tell you why. I had to spend the surpluses. Deficits make it easier to say no.'" (Hans Nichols, "Leadership Lines Up With Deficit Doves,"

 "In all, Taxpayers for Common Sense estimated, Mr. Santorum helped secure more than $1 billion in earmarks during his Senate career, which stretched from 1995 through 2006." (Michael Luo and Mike McIntire, "Donors Gave As Santorum Won Earmarks," 
, 1/15/12)
 SANTORUM: "I'm not saying necessarily earmarks are bad. I have had a lot of earmarks. In fact, I'm very proud of all the earmarks I put in bills. I'll defend earmarks." (Fox News' "Hannity," 2/26/09)
