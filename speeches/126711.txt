Said Klug, "John Kasich is a reformer who isn't afraid to take on the status quo. He listens, takes people's priorities to heart and puts positive solutions and ideas first. That is a remarkable quality of a proven leader who stands ready to be president. I am honored to join Governor Kasich's team and help spread his message across the country."
Congressman Scott Klug represented Wisconsin's 2nd congressional district for three terms from 1991-1999. He is from Madison, Wisconsin.
