 — In a new 
, 2012 Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul beats President Obama 51 percent to 49 percent in a general election race.
"This is yet another poll that clearly proves how competitive Ron Paul is against the sitting President," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton. "Dr. Paul is making strides, affirming that the American people are looking for conviction instead of the typical status quo rhetoric being offered by establishment candidates."
These results come just a few weeks after a 
 showed Ron Paul polling within striking distance of President Obama among registered voters. Furthermore, a late August 
 showed him within 1 percent of President Obama in a head-to-head matchup.
Another recent 
, conducted August 17-18, shows Paul only 2 percentage points behind Obama in a general election match-up. In a similar head-to-head survey from last year done by 
, Dr. Paul drew a statistical dead heat with the President. And earlier this year in a survey by 
, he did the best out of the other Republicans put up against Obama in a head-to-head poll.
