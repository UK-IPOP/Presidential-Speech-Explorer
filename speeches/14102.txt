[ Released February 27, 1946. Dated February 26, 1946 ]
I AM SURE you are familiar with the acute need for foodstuffs in the war-torn countries of Europe and Asia. Our national self-respect and our duties as human beings demands that we do all possible to stop the spread of famine. I have directed the agencies of Government to do everything possible to this end. But Government alone is not enough. We cannot meet this situation without an aggressive voluntary program on the part of private citizens to reduce food consumption in this country. I am asking you and a very few other public spirited citizens to meet in the East Wing of the White House at three o'clock, Friday afternoon, March first, to work out means for supporting such a voluntary program. Ex-President Hoover has accepted my invitation and will be there. I count on your support.
