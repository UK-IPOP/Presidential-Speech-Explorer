 Well, thank you very much. This is a special moment. I spoke with Allen Jones about a year ago. And Allen now is 95 years old. Great World War II hero. And when I spoke to him, I said, "Come on up to the White House sometime, and I'll see you." And guess what? He called, and he said, "Hey, you promised." And I deliver, right?

I deliver.

. You did.

We don't play games.

And it's an honor to see you, Allen. And Allen is with some of his friends—Sidney Walton, World War II veteran. Great gentleman, a great hero. And he's 100 years old. And I want to be like you someday. [
] I want to be like all of you guys someday. [
] That's great—100. And thank you very much. Thanks, Sidney. That's fantastic. Thank you.

And Floyd Wright—and Floyd Wigfield. And Paul—where's Paul? Paul Kriner is fantastic. Paul is, let's see, 103. He doesn't look a day over 90. [
] A hundred and three. You look fantastic. Congratulations. Congratulations. War hero.

And Floyd Wigfield, who is 101, and you are amazing. Look at you, huh? Look at you. Look at you. So fantastic. I'm glad you took me up on the offer.

And surrounded by their family—very good genes in this family. You're going to live a long time, right? You're proud of the folks.

 Absolutely.

 Do you have anything to say about him?

 Oh, our dad is the most wonderful dad in the world. He always has been.

 And right here, right? Very good. That's great.

 This is our dad, right here. Yes.

 The most wonderful dad. Isn't that great?

 The most wonderful dad you could ever imagine.

 What he's doing, Mr. President, is incredible. He's traveling the whole country—all 50 Governors, and now meeting the President—he's spreading the word of how few World War II veterans there are left. And——

 Do you know how many actually? Do you know? Is there a number?

 It's really—what I've been told, it's just a handful.

 Wow. Isn't that incredible. 
 And he's on a year-and-a-half tour meeting all—not only all the Governors, but he's meeting hundreds of thousands of people along the way.

 That's fantastic. Well, congratulations on having a great gentleman. That is—you know, I'm a big believer in having good genes, and you have the best genes you could have, right?

 Thank you. Luck of the draw.

 So you travel a little bit with him, do you? Do you travel?

 Yes. I'm with him all the time.

 That's fantastic. That's fantastic. Let me see what that says. "Sidney, 100-year-old . . ." Wow.

 "No Regrets Tour."

 No regrets.

 Because he regretted not meeting a Civil War veteran when he had the chance. [
] And he doesn't want anyone to regret not meeting a World War II veteran.

 That's really nice. No, I don't think anybody does. That was a great victory. That was a great victory. We knew how to win wars. That was a tremendous victory.

So tell me, how—you talk to me—the way we spoke, we had the greatest conversation. Tell them what we said.

. Can you hear him?

 Yes.

 Allen.

 I expressed to the President at the convention last year—he asked me to come on the stage, which was awesome. I was afraid that the Secret Service was going to grab me when I put my arm around you.

 He just wrapped his arm around me. [
]

 And I had a picture with me, and I asked the President if he would sign it for me. He said he sure would. And I said to him that I was going to be 95 today, President, on April 11. And I said, "Well, I'd like to bring my family to the White House and meet in the Oval Office," because somebody told me that I would never get in the Oval Office. [
]

And I really appreciate, Mr. President, for you allowing us to come to be with you today. And I just wish you the best in all of your endeavors.

 Thank you very much.

 I've got a young man back home, Mr. President—I told you to not let me speak. [
]

 That's okay. No, he speaks well. He speaks very well.

 I've got a young man back home that comes to my church Sunday school class almost every Sunday, and your name is mentioned by him. And I've got to get a picture to take back for him. 
 We'll do that.

 That would just be——

 We'll do that.

 He'll be one of your—I want to ask you one other question. [
]

 Go ahead.

 When you're in Pittsburgh, I'd like to be on the stage with you.

 Okay. We can do that—which will be soon. We'll do that.

 If you can arrange it, I'd appreciate that.

 A hundred percent. That's why he's successful, because he's very aggressive. [
] He's an aggressive—he's an aggressive, great guy. Thank you very much. I really appreciate it.

 And I've got one more picture for you to sign.

 Let me have it. Let me have it. Thanks, Allen. Let me see.

 Well, I don't want to give—there you are. That's the one—we took it on the stage.

 Whoa, that's the one we took. See? I'm going to sign this one, right? Yes? I'll sign this one for you?

 Please, yes.

 Okay. I'm going to sign this one. And Paul, how about you? Tell me. You're feeling good?

 I was in a combat outfit. It was rumored, we were second longest in combat. We had the 517 days of combat.

 Wow.

 And, well, I started out in Africa, and Italy, France, and Germany. And I was in the Alps mountain area when the war ended. And our last position was at Füssen, southern Germany, in an Alps mountain area. We were pulled out and went into Schongau. It was a German army camp where they trained Air Force identification people.

 Right.

 And we processed 14,000 prisoners there in 2 weeks.

 Wow.

 And——

 That's pretty amazing, right? So do you remember those days perfectly?

 Yes, sir.

 That's really something.

 I was also in the Korean war too.

 Pretty good warrior, isn't he? Huh? 
 Twenty-six months in—[
].

 A hundred and three. Well, you're going to be around a long time. You look fantastic. You look fantastic. And I really appreciate you being in the White House and the Oval Office.

Tell us something about the man.

 We're his——

 Tell us. Tell us. Go ahead.

 He's not shy. You nailed it perfectly.

 No, he's not shy. [
]

 Not at all.

 He's not shy at all.

 I'm just like him. And this is my brother. Go ahead.

 Good, good. Congratulations.

 We're very proud of dad. Dad was one of five brothers that went off to World War II. And his mom was a Gold Star mother. One of them didn't return.

 Oh, wow.

 So dad is very proud to be a World War II veteran. And his family and God and——

 Well, we're proud of him. Proud of all of you.

Floyd? How about yourself?

 I was with the 4th Division. And we went in on Utah Beach on June 20—in June of '44. And we made the—I was on the—we made a third—was on the third wave and——

 And that was pretty brutal, Utah. And it was pretty—that was a pretty brutal area at the time, wasn't it?

 Yes. I was there about a half a month before I got wounded. Night and day on the battlefield. And——

 How badly wounded out there? Were you badly wounded?

 Yes, well, I was all summer there, getting me back out of the hospital. They sent me back up, and I went back up into West Germany somewhere. Then, another shell came. [
]

 You got wounded again. [
]

 Back in France, back in England again. And that time, they sent me home.

 Wow. Fantastic job.

Are you together? Huh?

 Paul and Floyd are both with the Greatest Generations Foundation. As you know, we return combat veterans back to where they fought and served. And we look forward to hosting you in Normandy this coming June for the 75th.

 Yes. I'll be there. I'll be there.

 Probably a good opportunity. This gentleman wants to fly back with you on Air Force One. [
]

 Where are you flying back to? Are you flying back to Washington? To Washington?

 Once we're done in Europe?

 We'll do that. We'll work that out. Is that okay? We'll work that out. You'll like Air Force One.

Well, I want to thank all of you. Great heroes. Great warriors. Highly respected. And you folks do a fantastic job.

Thank you.

I want to thank you. And congratulations to everybody.

Yes, please.

 President Trump, my father just wanted to say a couple things, if he may.

Dad, please tell the President the reason why you joined the Army.

 I joined the Army to fight Hitler.

 That's the reason he joined.

 That was good reason.

 And it's called now the "No Regrets Tour." You regret not meeting the Civil War veterans, right?

 Yes. I regret not meeting any Civil War veterans.

 And that's why he's allowing people that want to meet a World War II veteran before it's too late to meet him.

 That's great.

 And he brought a gift for you.

 Good.

 And we have the gift back there. I think you'll like it. It's a very special gift that my dad has carried from San Diego——

 Do you want to bring it up?

——from San Diego, just for you.

 Great.

 Here, Dad. The President is going to open the gift that you got him.

 From San Diego, where we just built a wall. [
] And they were very happy that I built it. [
]

 Oh, that's beautiful. That's beautiful. That's fantastic. Thank you very much.

 And all my dad asks is, if you happen to know how to tweet, if you want to tweet that out, you're welcome to.

 I don't tweet too much. [
]

 It would be an honor if you will do that.

 I'll do something. I will. We'll have a little fun with it.

 Right, Dad?

 Yes.

 Yes?

 Yes.

 Is this one of the best days of your life?

 Yes.

 That's great. That's really nice.

 Yes. Yes, indeed. It is.

 You have a great family. You have a great family.

Well, I want to thank everybody. These are just terrific people. We weren't going to do this with the media. But frankly, when I saw you, I said, "We have to." And thank you. Great job.

Go ahead, please.

 Mr. President, I want you to meet my wife. We've been married 69 years.

 Whoa.

 And she probably can tell you more about me than I can tell myself.

 Come on. Give us just the good stuff, not the bad stuff. [
]

 Well, is there much to say, then? [
] It's all been good.

 That's great.

 Couldn't be any better.

 That's really nice. I can see that in your face. I can see that. Thank you.

Thank you all very much. It's a great honor.

Thank you all very much.



Mr. President, do you consider WikiLeaks a hostile intelligence service, like Mike Pompeo said? 
 I really don't know much about them.

Do you regret praising WikiLeaks?

 I don't know much about them.

Thank you very much.
