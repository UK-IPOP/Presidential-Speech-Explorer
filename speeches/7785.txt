I HAVE received with particular pleasure Your Excellency's telegram, sent as the first message by the service being inaugurated today between the Republic of Panama and the United States of America by the Tropical Radio Telegraph Company, whereby you convey cordial greetings in the name of the Government and people of Panama to the Government and people of the United States.
In requesting you, Mr. President, to receive from the Government and people of the United States the assurances of their admiration and friendship for the people and Government of Panama, I desire to express the hope that this further contribution to the numerous ties so fortunately uniting our two countries may prove to be of mutual and continued value and service.
HERBERT HOOVER
[His Excellency Florencio Harmodio Arosemena, President of Panama, Panama]
