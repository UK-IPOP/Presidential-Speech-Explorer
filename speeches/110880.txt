— 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul will make a far-reaching visit to the early voting state of Nevada, cementing the aggressive posture his campaign has taken as it presents Dr. Paul as the sole authentic conservative vying for the Republican nomination.
"We are pleased to have Dr. and Mrs. Paul visit Nevada for a series of events to energize caucus goers and bring to a close the exciting campaign season. In selecting who is the authentic, electable conservative in this race, Nevadans will be choosing from among our candidate's establishment competitors and the 'Champion of the Constitution,'" said Ron Paul 2012 Nevada Chairman Carl Bunce.
"This visit is an opportunity for candidates to make their closing arguments. We're prepared to bring forth evidence that Ron Paul represents perfectly the values of Nevadans on issues such as renewed prosperity and returning power to the people and the states," said Mr. Bunce.
In addition to the inspiring and productive campaign activities the 12-term Congressman from Texas will partake in, Dr. Paul and his lovely wife Carol are celebrating their 55
 wedding anniversary in Las Vegas. Dr. and Mrs. Paul are the proud parents and grandparents of five children—including tea party darling U.S. Senator Rand Paul (R-KY)—and 18 grandchildren. The couple will celebrate their 55
 year of marriage on February 1
.
