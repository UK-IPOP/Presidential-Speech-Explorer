JUSTICE Hugo L. Black brought to the Supreme Court a mind that was brilliantly lucid and a character that was earnest and strong.
Justice Black believed that the primary responsibility of the judiciary was that "of giving force and effect to Constitutional liberties." In his judicial life he did exactly that--with such independence, tenacity, and total integrity of mind that his imprint on the Constitution and on our Nation will be indelible.
His faith in the United States Constitution was absolute, and so his convictions were rooted absolutely.
Mrs. Nixon and I join the Nation in mourning at the death of this noble American.
