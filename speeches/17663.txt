I HAVE TODAY approved S. 2862. This is one of a series of bills enacted by the Congress over the years to provide relief of the sheep raising industry by making available special nonquota immigrant visas to skilled alien sheepherders.
Although this was the sole purpose of the bill when first introduced, it was so amended as to make this measure the first major adjustment of standards for permanent admission to the United States since enactment of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.
I am deeply gratified that the Congress has recognized the need for a more flexible approach to our immigration problems and has taken this first step toward correcting injustices inherent in the system.
