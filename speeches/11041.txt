Dear Dr. Crumbine:
I have before me your report on Porto Rico, together with Governor, Theodore Roosevelt's later report on conditions in that island, and am otherwise aware of the shocking health conditions prevailing over the whole population.
I am in hearty sympathy with your efforts in their behalf. It is an American job. Porto Ricans are American citizens, living under the American flag. We must help them toward self-protection as we would any others of our own people in similar distress. Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
