His Excellency

Luigi Einaudi

President of the Italian Republic
I wish to convey to you my profound gratification and that of the American people at the achievement of an agreement on the delicate Trieste problem. This agreement, worked out through long months of difficult but friendly and constructive endeavor, gives testimony to the far-sighted statesmanship and good will of the government of Italy. It is my earnest hope and expectation that this arrangement will usher in a new era of fruitful collaboration that will contribute to the prosperity and security not only of Italy and Yugoslavia but of all the free nations of Europe. We agree, I am sure, that this fine example of the ability of neighbor nations amicably to settle extremely difficult questions will be highly reassuring to our own peoples and those of friendly nations throughout the world.
Please accept, Mr. President, my heartfelt congratulations at the efforts which you and the members of the Italian government have exerted to make possible this agreement which has so materially contributed to the possibility of maintaining peace in the world.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
