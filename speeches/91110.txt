 -- it is a direct descendant of the plan she chose not to support in 1993. And with some clever consensus building, it is just the sort of bill that may have a chance to work." [Time, 9/20/07 ]
 "Hillary Clinton has learned from her gravest political mistake. The health plan she unveiled this week contained the best of her 1993 initiative - health insurance for all - while avoiding the government expansion that doomed the earlier plan." [Boston Globe, 9/20/07 ]

 "Jonathan Gruber, an economics professor at M.I.T. who helped create the lauded Massachusetts health care system (and who advised all of the leading Democrats on their health care plans), said he found the Clinton proposal to be 'excellent.' He said that it went further than the Obama plan in that it mandated universal coverage, and was more progressive than the Edwards campaign's in that it would end tax breaks on health-care benefits for wealth Americans that went beyond the baseline benefits provided by the federal system."
