Dear Dan:
Our country, as you know, has an important stake in the fortunes and destiny of the Republic of Korea. Since the cessation of hostilities there last July, we have continued to improve its military position and have also assumed the task of helping to rebuild its war-torn economy. The results of these endeavors will profoundly affect our leadership and prestige in the Far East and indeed throughout the free world.
I am persuaded that a short visit to Korea by a select group of State executives who are constantly in direct touch with the American people would be highly beneficial. Their personal evaluation of our progress would provide the public with the essential knowledge and broad understanding to which it is entitled.
Accordingly, I would be deeply appreciative if you, together with other members of the Executive Committee of the Governors' Conference, could go to Korea on or about April 1 and, upon your return, give an appraisal of the situation there based on first-hand observation. Will you canvass your Committee and advise me which Governors wish to make the trip?
With kind regard,
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
