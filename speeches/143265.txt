In their first joint meeting as Treasury Secretary-designee and Deputy Treasury Secretary-designee, Janet Yellen and Wally Adeyemo hosted a virtual roundtable with racial and economic justice leaders Monday afternoon. Yellen and Adeyemo reaffirmed their commitment to placing racial equity at the center of the economic recovery, focusing on the households, businesses and communities hardest hit by the pandemic, and to pursuing economic policies that address the long-term, systemic and structural issues that have led to the racial wealth gap and economic disparities that exist today.

They discussed joint priorities including infusing equity into policymaking and leveraging the full powers and authorities of the Treasury Department to counteract the legacy impact of systemic racism; and building an economy that works for everyone. Yellen and Adeyemo shared their vision to enhance Treasury's focus on racial and economic equity, and to cement that focus within the structure, culture and operations of the entire Department.

They also expressed their desire to make this an ongoing partnership with regular dialogue, and thanked these leaders for offering their support and advice, and for their commitment to helping translate the President-elect's policies to the millions of Americans they represent, and share with the administration what they are hearing and seeing from their constituents on the ground.
