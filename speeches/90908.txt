 "'This is certainly a tax increase on business,' declared Mike Tanner, health-care analyst at the free-market Cato Institute in Washington, D.C. He called the requirement that everyone get health insurance 'unprecedented in terms of government interference in people's lives.'"

 "If U.S. health costs continue to rise about twice as fast as wages, the price tag may outstrip the available state tax and other revenue, some of the program's architects say. Insurers may no longer be able to offer the same low-cost plans they negotiated with the state, industry representatives say … Tax increases may be needed to keep the program going, said Robert Blendon, a health economist at Harvard University in Cambridge.

 (Lisa Wangsness, "In Ways, Clinton Healthcare Plan Resembles Romney's Mass. Solution," The Boston Globe, 9/18/07)
 "As governor of Massachusetts, Romney pushed a plan that requires state residents to get health insurance or face tax penalties. The law includes a new bureaucracy to implement it, government subsidies for the poor and guidelines for health insurance companies. The effort broke new ground by sharing responsibility between government, business and individuals." (Ron Fournier, "Analysis: Health Care Debate Reveals Much About Clinton, Romney," The Associated Press, 9/18/07)
 "But the central premise of Clinton's plan – an 'individual mandate' requiring that every American have health insurance – is precisely what Romney proposed in the Bay State, in what was seen as a bold approach to attaining universal coverage. The idea became a pillar of the law, which he signed in April 2006." (Lisa Wangsness, "In Ways, Clinton Healthcare Plan Resembles Romney's Mass. Solution," The Boston Globe, 9/18/07)
 "The proposal, approved Tuesday by Massachusetts' Democratic-led Legislature, won Romney cautious praise from Democrats, including a longtime champion of health care overhaul: Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York. 'To come up with a bipartisan plan in this polarized environment is commendable,' said the former first lady, who led President Clinton's failed health care campaign."

 "A professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Gruber was a key architect of the state's universal coverage law, which fully came into force on July 1. It was the top accomplishment of Republican Gov. Mitt Romney's administration. His basic idea is to take that approach nationwide. That would require a mandate that people get insurance but provide generous subsidies for the poor to get insured. Businesses that don't offer coverage would be penalized. Federal programs like Medicaid would be expanded." (Sean Higgins, "Key Mass. Health Plan Architect," Investor's Business Daily, 7/31/07)
