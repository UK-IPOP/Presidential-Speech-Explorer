I APPLAUD the action taken by the House Banking and Currency Committee this morning in its overwhelming approval of the administration's Demonstration Cities Act. This is vital legislation--important to the future of American cities, large and small.
It will help rebuild where there is blight and renew where there is decay. This is good news for the future of every city in America and the citizens that live in our cities.
It will allow the cities, the Federal Government, and private enterprise to join together in a common effort to achieve the goal of the better life for all our people.
