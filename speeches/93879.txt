DES MOINES, IA – In honor of the Thanksgiving holiday, Hillary Clinton will kick-off a statewide food drive in Iowa this Saturday, November 10th, to benefit Iowans without homes.
The Clinton campaign will begin collecting non-perishable food items this Saturday afternoon at its staging location prior to the Jefferson Jackson Dinner in Des Moines, and will accept them through Wednesday, November 21. Food donations can also be dropped off at the campaign's Polk County field office in Des Moines, as well as at any of its regional field offices around the state.
During Thanksgiving week, Clinton will personally deliver the food to Central Iowa Shelter and Services in Des Moines, where she will also spend time volunteering to help the homeless.
"Serving the ‘least of these' in our communities is the ultimate contribution to the common good. We are all blessed when we join together to offer a helping hand," said Senator Clinton. "Real thanksgiving comes through service, through living out the truest meaning of the Golden Rule. I am honored to join with the people of Iowa in lifting up our fellow Americans in need as we enter the holiday season."
All food donations should be non-perishable. Canned and dry foods in bulk are preferred.
 
Food donations can be made at the following locations.
