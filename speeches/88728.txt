 Last year, President Bush asked Congress to strengthen protections for the pensions American workers rely on, and Congress responded by passing this bipartisan bill.
 The legislation:
 Businesses that offer a private pension plan to their employees have a duty to set aside enough money now, so their workers get what they have been promised when they retire.
 Defined contribution plans are helping Americans build a society of ownership and financial independence, and this legislation makes it easier for workers to participate in these plans. The legislation:
 Entitlement programs are projected to grow faster than the economy, faster than the population, and faster than the rate of inflation. If we fail to act, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid will be almost 60 percent of the entire Federal budget in the year 2030. President Bush continues to call on Congress to meet its duty to reform these programs so we can ensure a secure retirement for all Americans.
