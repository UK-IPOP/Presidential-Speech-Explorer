Dear Bob:
I'm deeply grateful to you for your excellent report on your inspection of Red Cross Disaster Operations in Oregon and Northern California areas recently ravaged by storms and floods.
It is extremely gratifying to know of the wonderful response of both public and private agencies to the needs of the disaster victims. I'm convinced as you are that the courage and strength of the victims and of those who are aiding them will be sufficient to insure rehabilitation of the area.

Congratulations on another job well done.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Honorable Robert W. Samoff, The American National Red Cross, National Headquarters, Washington, D.C.]
