I HAVE received today the third volume of the report on Science and Public Policy, submitted by John R. Steelman in accordance with Executive Order 9791. This volume, entitled "Administration for Research" analyzes the management of research by the Federal Government, points out key problems and recommends ways of improving the administration of the vast research and development program conducted by the Government.
I am directing the Federal departments and agencies which have important research and development functions to give careful consideration to the analysis and recommendations made in this report. The report also merits careful study by scientists outside the Government.
