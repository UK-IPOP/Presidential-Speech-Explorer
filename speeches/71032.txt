The Administration supports the goal of H.R. 3249, which is to establish procedures for Federal agencies to provide an equitable remedy for employees who were mistakenly placed in the wrong retirement system during the transition from the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) to the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS). However, the Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3249 for the following reasons:
The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on this issue and urges enactment of the Administration's proposal, the "Retirement Coverage Error Correction Act of 1997," which was transmitted to Congress on November 7, 1997.
H.R. 3249 would affect direct spending and receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary PAYGO estimate is under development.
