 On Friday, May 15
, Advisor to the President Ivanka Trump and USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue will travel to Laurel, MD to visit Coastal Sunbelt Produce to highlight USDA'S $19 Billion Coronavirus Farmer Assistance Program using funding and authorities provided in the CARES Act and the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA). As a part of this program, the new $3 Billion Purchase and Distribution Program, otherwise known as the Farmers to Families Food Box Program, USDA will partner with national, regional and local suppliers, whose food supply chain has been significantly impacted by the closure of many restaurants, hotels and other food service entities, to purchase and distribute up to $3 billion in fresh produce, dairy and meat products. Suppliers will deliver food boxes to food banks, community and faith-based organizations and other non-profits serving Americans in need.

Advisor Trump and Secretary Perdue will do a brief tour of Coastal Produce's Distribution Center and show an example of a food box set to be delivered on Friday.

Advisor Trump has been working closely with USDA to ensure our Nation's farmers receive critical support through the implementation of the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program as a part of FFRCA and the CARES Act. USDA estimates that in the first round of contracts, a 
 recipients were small or regional food suppliers and will receive an estimated 
 in contracts over the next 45 days. The participating farmers will receive assistance for their businesses while also providing fresh food to those most in need through the Farmers to Families Food Box.
Coastal is an approved contractor with AMS under the Farmers to Families Food Box Program. The contract is to source and deliver American grown fresh fruit and fresh vegetable boxes up to $4,540,000. Coastal will package these products into family-sized boxes, then transport them to food banks, community and faith-based organizations, and other non-profits serving Americans in need starting on May 15, 2020. Current Coastal partners include Parker Farms as a supplier and the Capitol Area Food Bank, the Maryland Food Bank, the Baltimore City Food Bank and Brighter Bites as recipient organizations.

Coastal was established in May 1992 and has emerged as the leading food service distributor of produce and dairy in the Mid-Atlantic. It operates out of a 330,000 square foot facility and delivers fresh products utilizing a fleet of over 185 refrigerated trucks that deliver to VA, DC, MD, DE, NJ, Eastern PA, and WV. Additionally, they employ over 1,000 people providing industry leading food safety, quality, a vast selection of products, and personal service. Coastal, also serves some of the largest chain restaurants and multi-unit operations in the nation, as well as many of the finest hotels, resorts, country clubs, caterers, and independent restaurants in the area.

 "Small businesses are the backbone of America's economy. Whether it be through the massively successful PPP program, including small agricultural businesses in EIDL, or by awarding up to 3 billion dollars to small, regional farmers, ranchers and distributors through the Farmers to Families Food Box program, this administration will continue to implement innovative and impactful policies to bolster American workers, families and small business owners." -

>From White House Press Office:

Today, President Donald J. Trump will sign the 2020 Armed Forces Day Proclamation and will be presented with the official flag of the sixth branch of the Armed Forces, the United States Space Force (USSF), by senior leaders of the military.

Flag background:
This flag was produced by dedicated artists and crafts people at the Defense Logistics Agency, Flag Room in Philadelphia (the same entity that makes the President's personal flags) from a design finalized and documented by the Department's Institute of Heraldry at Fort Belvoir, VA. This is the first new Service and accompanying Service Flag in over 72 years. The official flag of the Space Force is derived from the Seal of the United States Space Force, which was approved by President Trump on 15 Jan 2020. The flag takes the key and central elements of the Seal and places them on a black field fringed in platinum with the words United States Space Force and Roman Numerals MMXIX (2019) below.

Seal background:
Dark blue and white combine to represent the vast recesses of outer space. The Delta Wing evokes historic ties to the earliest days of the U.S. Air Force space community, and symbolizes change and innovation. It also represents all variations of space vehicles that support our National Defense Strategy and National Security Space Strategy. Dark and light shades of grey within the delta embody the 24/7 (x-apple-data-detectors://2) operations of the Space Force, while the placement and upward orientation of the delta reveals the central role of the Space Force in defending the space domain. The Globe represents the terrestrial home of the U.S. Space Force and it's support to the joint warfighters. The Elliptical Orbit (around the globe) signifies defense and protection from all adversaries and threats emanating from the space domain. It also represents ongoing interagency cooperation and allied partnerships. The white Polaris symbolizes the guiding light of security and alludes to a constantpresence and vigilance in space now and in the future. Two clusters of small stars represent the space assets developed, maintained, and operated by the U.S. Space Force. The three larger stars symbolize the Organize, Train, and Equip functions of the Space Force.

US Space Force background:
*Â Â Â Â Â On June 18, 2018, POTUS directed the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Pentagon to establish a Space Force as the sixth branch of the Armed Forces.
*Â Â Â Â Â On February 19, 2019, POTUS signed SPD-4, outlining the presidential policy framework for establishing the United States Space Force.
*Â Â Â Â Â On December 20, 2019, POTUS signed the FY 20 National Defense Authorization Act into law, creating the United States Space Force (USSF) as the 7th branch of the armed forces, and announced General John "Jay" Raymond would be the first Chief of Space Operations for the U.S. Space Force. Since then, DoD and the US Air Force (USAF) have been hard at work implementing the legislation and standing up the Space Force.
*Â Â Â Â Â On January 24, 2020 POTUS announced the official seal of the USSF.

2 min warning for briefing called at 2:37pm 


As always please double check against transcript.

"We have all the cards, because we have the cards of the American people I know what they want, and I've always known what they want. That's why I'm sitting here...phase 4 is going to happen...it's going to happen in a much better way for the American people."



Secretary Esper: "It's a very historic moment. The United States has been a spacefaring nation for decades, but we know there are adversaries, in the last several years that have weaponized space. They've made it a warfighting domain. And so with the establishment of Space Force and establishment of Space Command, the United States is now doing what it needs to do to protect our assets in space and ensure that space remains the heavens by which we not only protect America, but we sustain our economy, we sustain our commercial capabilities,we sustain Americans way of life."

.:"It's critical that we're going to sustain our way of life, we're going to defend our nation that we're going to have to defend ourselves in space, and therefore the need for space force and it's a great day for the nation."

: "We're proud of this flag. We're proud to have an opportunity to present it to you."

"Very few people realize how important space is to everything that we do, and that it's vulnerable, because we need to up our game in space. And you've recognized that and built a force that will help to protect our assets in space and deter aggressive actions in space and if deterrence doesn't work, to be able to defend our assets in space and those of our allies."

 said we're "building right now incredible military equipment," before going on to describe the "Super Duper" missile.

"We have, I call it the Super Duper Missile, and I heard the other night 17 times faster than what they have right now, when you take the fastest missile we have right now. You've heard Russia has five times and China's working on five or six times, we have one 17 times and it's just gotten the go ahead." 


apologies â€” the last pool report I sent out with two minute warning should have been Pool Report 10 not 8.

At 3:56pm pool escorted to Rose Garden for ceremony. Among those seated are three Girl Scouts wearing masks. 3 police officers. There are two podiums set. One on the grass and the other on the steps leading up to Oval
