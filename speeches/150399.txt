Good morning again from Lewes, Del. I'll be your print pooler today.
We've just had our call time pushed to 12:00 p.m. There's nothing on the president's schedule so far, but we'll keep you updated if that changes.
Our call time is now 2:00 p.m.
It's looking a bit stormy outside and the chance of rain is rising for the rest of the day.
Our call time has been moved back another hour.
ICYMI this morning, the president released 
 on Dr. Anthony Fauci's departure.
And we're now pushed back until 6:00 p.m.
Still no word on any activity this evening but we'll continue to stand by.
