My dear Mr. Banham :
I have your kind letter of April 4th. I have been much interested in the survey made by the New York Board of Trade, which is very encouraging.
I am to deliver an address before the United States Chamber of Commerce in the course of the next few weeks, on which occasion I hope to make a statement as to the business situation.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
