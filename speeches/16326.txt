THE AMERICAN people value peace and freedom above all things. Our ratification of the North Atlantic Pact with the overwhelming support of the Senate and the people shows our determination to preserve this peace and freedom.
This treaty is an historic step toward a world of peace, a free world, free from fear, but it is only one step. We have malice toward none. With our partners in the pact and other like-minded peoples we must, with God's help and guidance, work for peace with every means at our command. We must keep ourselves morally and materially strong. We must play our part in helping to strengthen freedom everywhere. We must work patiently and tirelessly to make the United Nations ever more effective for its great task. We must seek ever greater unity of purpose and of action in the cause of peace.
