 ("John McCain's Record on Economic Issues," The Club For Growth, 3/12/07)
 
'S RICH LOWRY: "Senator, things are really heating up on the campaign trail. If you don't mind, I want to ask you a domestic policy question, a straight talk question, if you will. In retrospect, was it a mistake for you to vote against the Bush tax cuts?" SEN. JOHN MCCAIN: "No, because I had significant tax cuts, and there was restraint of spending included in my proposal." (Fox News' "Hannity & Colmes," 12/28/07)
SEN. JOHN MCCAIN: "So these tax cuts need to be made permanent. Otherwise, they would have the effect of tax increases." (Fox News' "Hannity & Colmes," 12/28/07)
RICH LOWRY: "Senator, specifically on tax cuts, even those these tax cuts help the economy grow, the deficit, which you were concerned about at the time, has actually gone down. So if you had it to do over again, you still would still vote against the Bush tax cuts?" SEN. JOHN MCCAIN: "Well, actually the deficit is still significant, but spending is out of control. ..." RICH LOWRY: "But you're saying you stick by your vote. It was the right thing to vote against the Bush tax cut?" SEN. JOHN MCCAIN: "Yes, Rich, perhaps I'm speaking in a different language to you..." RICH LOWRY: "I'm persistent, if nothing else." SEN. JOHN MCCAIN: "...as part of those tax cuts. As a part, I would have restrained spending. And if we would had restrained spending, as we should have, as part of that package, then we would be talking about further tax cuts today. And I want to add, these tax cuts must be made permanent. They must be made permanent." (Fox News' "Hannity & Colmes," 12/28/07)
