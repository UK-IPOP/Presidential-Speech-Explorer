The Administration supports S. 1530, but will seek, during further congressional consideration of the bill, amendments to ensure project accountability. Specifically, the Administration will seek amendments that: (1) require each demonstration project to describe specific, measurable goals; (2) include exact, meaningful standards for Federal review and approval of projects; and (3) provide for the termination of projects that do not make acceptable progress toward meeting their stated goals.



S. 1530 could increase direct spending; therefore, it would be subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is that it would have a zero PAYGO effect.
