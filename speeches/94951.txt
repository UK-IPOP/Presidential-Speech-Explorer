The Clinton campaign today announced the launch of the Rapid Responders, a national group of truth tellers who will respond to inaccurate or misleading attacks directed at Senator and President Clinton. The Rapid Responders will operate in all of the 22 states that will hold caucuses or primaries on February 5th.
"We intend to keep this campaign focused on the issues, and ensure that voters and the media have accurate information," said former Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Turpen.
Wherever and whenever her opponents misrepresent Hillary's positions in their states, the Rapid Responders will set the record straight, said Maricopa County (AZ) Supervisor Mary Rose Garrido Wilcox.
"We're going to make sure that misleading attacks and distortions of Senator Clinton's record don't go unanswered," Wilcox said.
"Facts are stubborn things, and we will insist that Senator Clinton's opponents be held accountable if they manipulate her statements or her record," said Georgia Labor Commissioner Michael Thurmond.
The Rapid Responders are made up of elected officials and community leaders who will track distortions of Hillary's record and answer quickly.
"It's our job to be vigilant and make sure that the truth prevails in this election," said California Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez.
Hillary supporters who hear misleading or inaccurate statements made by her opponents are encouraged to contact the campaign.
