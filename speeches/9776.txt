My dear Mr. Commissioner:
The admirable police arrangements during my recent visit to New York added greatly to my pleasure and comfort and I wish you to know how cordially I appreciate your efforts.
I will be obliged if you will also convey to the members of your Department my thanks for their part in this valued service.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
