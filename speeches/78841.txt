 Good morning, everybody.
 Good morning, sir.
 Let's go. I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll walk about 3 or 4 miles, and then we'll end up having coffee. Mrs. Bush wants to say hello to everybody.
 All right.
 Come on. Come on, Barney. We'll walk out—it's a little muddy. I need somebody walking up here with me. I can't be—Reed, get out of the pictures. [
] Come on, Stretch [David Gregory, NBC News], get in here.
 How are you? Happy New Year.
 Same to you all. We're trimming a lot of underbrush, still. Come on, Barn. Are you going to make it, Heidi [Holly Rosenkrantz, Bloomberg News]?
 I'll be fine.
 We've got a truck for you back there.
 Don't worry about me.
 Who's going to carry Barney?
 He's coming.
 He can walk 4 miles?
 Oh, yes, he'll walk 4. Where is he? Come on over, Barney.
 I don't remember—you've had the guesthouse all along, right?
 That's the Secret Service.
 That I know, but I mean, last time I actually saw this was 2000——
 Oh, really?
 ——when it was still a shell. Remember, you walked us through that in July?
 Turn right here, guys. That's a little—right over there is another little house we refurbished, got a gym in there, and one bedroom. And then that's a little guesthouse over there, a garage.
 That was part of the original——
 Yes.
 Look at Barney trying to make it through the woods there.
 Come on, boy.
 Lot of legs.
 He's trying to get to you. [
]
 This is pretty good—[
]—in there.
 Is this manmade, sir?
 Manmade.
 How many acres?
 About 11 acres lake, 17 foot deep, the deepest spot. I put 600 black bass in there a few years ago, and about 30,000 bait fish. And they're about 2 1/2 to 3 pounds now. A bad time to fish, because the fish are lethargic during the cold. We've got bluegill and shad and perch.
 [
]
 Oh, it's fantastic. We got up yesterday—Laura and I have got a tradition of—we go for a sunrise walk on the first day of the year. So yesterday we popped about of bed about 7:20 a.m., and we started moving, walked 4 miles.
 Great.
 Wasn't as chilly yesterday.
 No, it wasn't.
 You'll get up and run in this cold, won't you?
 Oh, absolutely. Start over there at the house. We've got different run-ning—come on, Barn.
 [
]
 Yes, maybe. This is an old dirt road, so we put—[
]—on it, to withstand the—we're going to walk— [
]—then we're going to go down into the canyons, so it won't be quite as cold.
 Will we see the waterfall?
 Absolutely.
 [
]
 I went in there yesterday to make sure there was water in—[
].
 So have you had friends out?
 Oh yes, every night. We've got—tonight we've got my long-time ally and friend Elton Bomer, who was the insurance commissioner and the secretary of state when I was the Governor, and a former state senator for this district, David Sibley, and his wife are coming. Condi's coming.
So, for example, this is one of the trails, this is a mile-and-a-half spot for one of the trails. You'll see those markers.
 From the house?
 From the house. The different colors on there. Is Barney back there? Is he back there? He's getting in the truck. [
] Barney got nervous with the crowd here.
 If he gets too far behind, we can helo him in.
 Now, these are all live oaks in here, and when live oaks like this they're called "motts."
 Motts? M-o-t?
 M-o-t-t. A mott is where a group of trees grow quite tight together.
 They never lose their leaves?
 The live oaks do not lose their leaves. And these are—this is great deer country in there. Here are some of the beautiful live oaks.
 Now, has the range changed a lot more—you made the lake a little bigger and——
 Yes, the lake is a little fuller, but only because of the wild grasses. And what Laura is doing is, around the house, is trying to restore the country to the native prairie grasses. And these are all different native grasses from Texas. So you'll see—when we get back to the house, all inside the barbed wire fence here will eventually be made——
 Has this all changed a lot since you came?
 Oh, yes. This is all different. And so in the spring, particularly in a year like this year, there will be fantastic wildflowers.
 How nice.
 How many miles of trails have you all put in?
 A lot.
 Just all over?
 Yes. You can run probably 6 miles without doubling.
 Without doubling over.
 The other thing that's really interesting—I hope we see them— is there are a lot of cardinals here this time of year.
 What's your favorite time to come?
 We might scare them away with this group.
 No, I don't think so. Any time.
 Really? You don't have a favorite season?
 No. I like it warm. [
]
 Really hot, huh?
 We're going to have a muddy spot up here, so bear with us. We're going to go right and head west out for about a mile. And then we're going to go down, and there will be a rest spot in there.
You're doing great.
 Oh, thanks. Don't worry about me.
 The medical unit will be here—[
]. We'll warm up going this way.
One of the things about this place you'll see is, for example, that little clump of trees is the head of a long canyon that goes down—I'll show you the canyon. There's seven different canyons on here that create really unique——
 They're not connected to one another?
 No, they're separate and unique.
 So when you tell us you're clearing brush, does that mean you're setting these trails up?
 No, no. What it means is—you see that little brush over there? The pile of brush?
 Yes.
 Underneath these—see those cedars right there, growing underneath the live oaks?
 Yes.
 We're cutting those down.
 Why?
 Because the cedars take water.
 Oh, okay.
 They talk water from the big trees, and they're kind of like a nuisance.
 Do you know how they got here?
 As a matter of fact, they got here when pioneers planted them for— go left here; this is the worst mud—pioneers planted them for fenceposts.
 And then they started to——
 You see the dark? I mean, we've got enough cedars for——
 You'll be clearing up——
 We won't clear this.
 It grows back real quick, right?
 It does grow back.
 Do you burn it?
 We burn it, yes. We were burning yesterday, but the grass wasn't dry—[
]—have to call in fire—[
].
 In Australia we call it "bigelow."
 Oops, be careful. That's the worst.
 The wetlands, right?
 Preserves. Claire, get in— oh, you made it? Oh, good. Whose shoes are you wearing, Claire?
 Harriet's. [
]
 The big tree up there on the left is called a cedar elm. Loses its leaves. It's got kind of a skirt to it, at the rear base of the—they tend to have a skirt to it.
 What are these trees here, these ones with the bare——
 It's some kind of a oak. The live oak doesn't lose its leaves. That one right there is a hackberry. They're a terrible tree. They're trash trees. They're not native.
That's a cedar elm there. Those are cedar elms, Stretch.
 How many cows?
 I've got 200 mother cows and 6 bulls. That's a cow camp operation, kind of like a little nursery, is the best way to put it.
 Now, these aren't yours. These are——
 No.
 Leases, or whatever?
 Yes. Kenneth Engelbrecht. I bought the place from his dad, and he and his wife live on here.
Isn't this a beautiful day?
 It really is. It's gorgeous.
 Have you had your run?
 I'm not going to run today. I went over—I had my CIA briefing and had a visit with the Vice President this morning.
 Via telecom?
 Yes. Real-time, secure——
 [
]
 Absolutely. [
]— technology.
 When did they really—when did they really bring that online?
 Last year. Pretty soon they're going to have it on Air Force One.
 What?
 Real-time, secure videoconferencing. It really changes—will change the nature of how people live in many ways.
 [
]
 [
]
 But imagine, you know, your business—or your business, for example. You'll be able to have——
 Oh, we're all ready—yes.
 You've got real-time—[
]—sitting around with your editors and——
 Oh, yes. There is so much that we're starting to do now on computers, where you can edit stuff on laptops and—[
].
 Maybe they can enhance your face. [
]
 That's what I'm working on.
 Super enhancement. [
]
 Oh, look at this, my wife just got me this little Palm Pilot here, and my organizer. It's got a camera in there.
 Oh, fantastic. I notice telephones have got that now, where you——
 Yes, oh, I know. I think that's a little too much business going on in—[
]. [
]
 So what you'll see is three different parts of Texas. You'll see this, kind of the central plains, flat. This is more rolling, where it's the—rock is closer to the surface. Oh, here comes Laura.
 Yes, I noticed she was out with friends, huh?
 Yes—[
].
 And Spot?
 Spot, the dog.
 Barney was out—one day out on where we do our live shot.
 Right. [
]
 I said, I don't think—[
]— out here fraternizing.
 That's not true. He knows that's not true. [
]
 We saw some fox, and looked like turkeys or——
 Turkey buzzards, yes. A lot of hawks here. Red tail, we saw a red tail hawk yesterday. There's those puppy dogs—loyal dog, great athlete.
[
]
 He came——
 Yes. Hey, Spotty. Hi, Laura.
 Hey.
 How is it? Take Barney with you, okay? He's in the truck. We'll see you back at the house.
 I mean, you do this often; I wasn't here, but when we were here in 2000, we went the other way, right? I seem to remember taking a drive the other way past the house. Am I wrong?
 No, you're right.
 It's hard to believe it was going on 3 years ago. [
]
 It's unbelievable, isn't it? Heck of an ordeal, wasn't it? For all of us involved.
 Yeah. [
]
 It's amazing what the democracy puts the—[
]—what kind of people are involved in the campaign, because we were—it's a grueling experience. I remember meeting your dad, sitting behind the——
 Yes. [
]
 How is he?
 He's doing great. Yes, he's doing great.
 Big old guy.
 Yeah, he is. We're real excited because I got—I was around Christmas and stuff——
 With the kid?
 I got the picture of you holding Max, and they loved that. [
]
 Well, I'm sure their life is changed with Max.
 Yes. They're having a great time. They're going up that way—I can't remember—in a week.
 That's fantastic.
 He's probably traveled more than I have. [
]
 That's hard to do, David.
 Yes. [
]
 It's warming up, Patsy [Patricia Wilson, Reuters].
 [
]—about 30 degrees warmer.
 Yesterday was fantastic.
 Yes, it was gorgeous.
 Do you believe how fast it does go, though? I mean, it's——
 A few months. Some of them are already talking about '04.
 Did you see Edwards—[
]—this morning?
 No.
 He announced on the "Today" show that he's going to be—[
].
 Oh, really?
 I haven't caught my breath from——
 Well, if you think about it—if you think about it, remember the '98 campaign, that was the—the beginning of the '98 campaign there was a lot of speculation about whether or not I was going to run. And got through the session and '99, it was right after that we all got on the plane.
 I remember——
 [
]
 Yes, I remember—[
]. I remember Jamie Gangel [NBC News] did that piece about you, and you—were you out fishing somewhere?
 That was in Austin. But that was before—I mean, that was in—[
]—Texas. That was when we had the place in east Texas.
 But that was early on, right? I mean, you weren't——
 No, I wasn't—[
]. That was a nice piece.
This is it for mud. [
] Down here—[
]. We go out to the tree line, way out there.
 You know, this summer was the first time I've been to Kennebunkport. That was just fabulous.
 It's nice, isn't it? It's not as nice as Crawford, but it's nice. [
] Yes, Kennebunkport is a beautiful place to—[
].
 [
] But it is a lot more boxed-in than this, you know? You can't come some place and just——
 Hang out. There's—[
]—he's looking at his cows.
 They seem like they do a good job of not shutting the place down at all.
 Kennebunkport?
 Yes.
 Yes, I guess. How do I know?
 It's a lot flatter here.
 Yes. It's not going to be flat here in a minute.
 [
]—didn't go anywhere yet.
 Well, that's a different— that's your pink route. We've got a lot of turkey live on this ranch. It's really fun to see them.
 They're pretty.
 Oh, they're fantastic. There's a tank right there. Right on the other side there's—[
].
 When you bought it, did you have a pretty good idea what you were getting? Or have you discovered——
 No, I discovered a lot. I really did. It was a—I knew we were getting some dramatic country that was very rare for Texas, but I wasn't sure about all the little nooks and crannies.
 Right. A lot of them still covered up?
 Yes, there are some. You'll see. You'll see some of the——
 There seems to be a fair amount of water on the property.
 A lot of water right there. But you'll see some of the places that we have cleaned out, and you'll see some of these cliffs that have got unique little structures to them. I discovered an interesting rock formation the other day when we were up here scouting around on this cliff.
There's a cottonwood tree. See that isolated tree right there? The cottonwood is a fantastic tree. It grows along the riverbed, and somehow this thing ended up here alone. It must have a source of water. We've got two cottonwood trees on the whole ranch, and that's one of them.
Patsy, are you hitting the tennis ball at all?
 No, not—it's too cold. My hands get too cold to hold the racket. I'm not ready to challenge John Bridgeland yet. [
]
 Bridgeland is a good player.
 I know. He played for Harvard, didn't he?
 I think he did. I'll tell you who's a good racket man, is Al Gonzales.
 Really?
 Racketball.
 Oh, racketball.
 Stretch claims he's a good tennis player.
 Well——
 Patsy and I—[
]—on today. [
]
 You're a serve-and-volley guy. I can see it a mile away.
 I'm working on my walk. [
] He's probably going to wear out pretty quick.
 You've got the big serve and volley.
 I can cover a lot—[
].
 I bet you can. Like my brother, Marvin, he's a big serve-and-volley man.
 [
]
 Yes. He's a good player.
 He is. He was able to get great partners, like Chris Evert's brother and people like that.
 You know, there's a lot of pros who have moved into McLean, like Jana Novotna—[
].
 Really?
The territory is beginning to change. See how these rocks were right up here on the surface? But what ends up happening is that over time, millions of years, rocky roads created these canyons we're going into. They're pretty sparse country where you've got your rocks—[
].
 So this is one of the canyons we're going into?
 This is the river bottom. We have 3 1/2 miles of river, stream. And the canyons feed into the bottoms here. But the waterfall—see the point right there? That's the headwaters of the waterfall, and we're going to go down—[
].
 Is this the same river that feeds— [
]?
 Yes. No, let's see. You know, I don't know. The middle fork of the Bosque—I think—I don't think so. I'm not sure. You know, it might. It might. You may be right. [
]—falls must be running pretty good right now.
 Yes.
 Does it look pretty?
 Yes, it's beautiful.
 We're going to a different part of the world now.
 I'm just grateful you didn't make us clear any brush. [
]
 Well, you'd like it. It's good exercise. I'll show you something interesting here. See how that water is coming out of those rocks? See it?
 Yes.
 All the aquifers are charged now because of the rain.
 [
]—Hill?
 No, no. [
]—Hill is back over there. We're not going to be able to get to it because the water across the crossing.
 Oh, really?
 Yes. [
]—you'd just get soaked.
 Can you get just as good a workout walking like this, as running?
 I think you can.
 I think you can, too. [
]
 You're working out with two. [
]
 But you've got to move. I kind of use it as a warmer-upper. It's good for you.
We're going to go right up here. Wait until you see this place I'm going to take you. It's cool.
 [
] [
]
 That was Barney. It's a different world down here.
 It's beautiful.
 We're headed right up in there. These are called chinaberries. See the little berry at the end there? We've got up here in this canyon you'll have ash, walnut, different kind of oaks. I've become a guy who really likes trees. [
]
 Crash course, right?
 Well, you can really get to appreciate them. Now this in here you couldn't—before we got in here you couldn't see the contours of this little canyon. And it was really hard to walk in here. We got in here and cleaned out a lot of the undergrowth, a lot of the dead trees that—see all those trees in there? They were all like that in here, way up in here. What I want to do is open this up so you can see the contours of this little canyon in here.
 Do you have people working here when you're not here, too?
 No, we do it ourselves, and we built all this that we're heading into.
 [
]
 Yes.
 There's just not that much brush to clear at the White House. [
]
 Well, they got people clearing it there. You could not move in here. I mean, we couldn't—a few years ago, you had to crawl through all these rocks to get up in here.
[
]
 [
]—enough rain, it may have created to charge those aquifers enough to withstand the heat.
 What kind of stone is this?
 Limestone. Real soft limestone.
 ——did you know right away when you bought the ranch, or did you discover it on——
 No. We had to clear this out. I mean, you could not come up here.
 But you brought people down here, right? Like a——
 [
]—in here. I didn't see this part of the ranch when——
 So it was a surprise?
 Yes, it was a surprise.
 It's a nice surprise.
 This is where Putin came. Jiang Zemin did not come down here, but Vladimir Putin did.
 That's cool.
 See the cedar? That grows right on the ledge.
 It's on the rocks.
 Has some of it already started to grow back——
 We didn't put it up there.
 [
]
 We don't clear up top. We clear down here when they go against these big—we clear the young.
 Right.
 So how wide a—[
]—that you cleared right——
 Yes, this is all—you could not walk in here, literally. It was overgrown. There were seven of them like this, with different cuts to them.
 All of them different.
 Did you do it yourself, or did——
 Oh, I do it myself.
 Really?
 Yes. It's part of the fun to be outside working. I really enjoy it. There's the great outdoors, and you're supposed to be in it. [
]
 Right.
 All right. Retreat.
 Watch those rocks, they're slick. [
]
 I've seen fox in here.
 [
]—Barney?
 No, he had some problems. I was afraid Barney would come out with—[
].
 Red fox or gray fox?
 Gray fox. Red fox are what?
 We have red fox around Washington.
 Yes.
 You just can't imagine that these kind of little nooks exist out here.
 No, isn't it amazing? We had—we brought some friends out here. And one of the guys driving said, "I can't imagine why President Bush bought this place. This is some of the worst country in Texas." But what he didn't realize is that the fingers of the Hill Country, which is where you all have been, south of Austin, extend up here. If you look on a map, you'll see the topography on the map shows this is some unique country.
 How much did you check out the land before you bought it?
 I went all over it. But I didn't, you know——
 You didn't find everything.
 Yes. I didn't crawl up in there. And we saw enough to know that there was some pretty unique relief.
 Do you really spend the largest percentage of your time, outside of working, out here?
 Absolutely. I'm either— my typical day is I will work from about 7 a.m. until 10 a.m., and then will come out and we'll cut cedar or fool around, you know, repair something.
 Right.
 And then we'll eat lunch about 12:30 p.m. And generally make phone calls then or answer mail or do whatever, and then get back out about 4 p.m. and fish. I love to fish.
 Now, when you're stocking your own pond, do you still get credit for catching? [
]
 Oh, yes, absolutely. The only time you don't get credit is when the Secret Service—right here, take a right— the Secret Service frogman puts it on for you. You see the snorkel.
 If you can't see him, then it's totally——
 Right. [
]
The last time we had the crew here, it was up to the top of that canyon, remember? We were clearing. There's another canyon that goes up in there. And here's the—here's where they end.
 This is the one we walked up.
 Right.
 With all the brambles and thorns.
 Right. That's right.
 Do you fish from the shore or do you——
 I've got a little boat in there.
 Bait fish or with lures?
 No, fish with lures. The jig is particularly good during the winter. These fish are very lethargic, real slow.
This is about a two-thirds mile pasture here. We're paralleling now the middle fork of the Bosque River. You'll see it when we get up here.
 What are these trees?
 Those are cedar elms. They're really pretty in the spring.
 Do they flower?
 No, they—they're in leaves. But they're beautiful skirts.
 Do you ever sleep in?
 No.
 Never? [
]
 [
]
 [
]
 No. I was probably asleep at 10 p.m. [
]
 Couldn't even see the ball drop on the East Coast.
 In Bermuda.
 [
] [
]
 I was looking for that ball dropping in London. [
]
 [
]—good enough for you.
 That's right. Put him in a Gator. The pickup is better.
Let me show you something that's really pretty here. When the sun sets—west is that way; east is this way—and when the sun sets, the cliffs over here, which you'll see in a minute, just completely glow.
A big cedar elm here.
 There's something running up here. Is this a white-tail or——
 Yes. Did you see it?
 Yes, I saw it.
 Yes, a white-tail deer.
 I grew up in Atlanta. I don't know my—[
].
 This is very interesting. There is a relatively tame white-tail that has been hanging around here. I saw it the last time I walked in here. And it just kind of paralleled—see the cliffs over there. That's not on our property. It's right on the other side of the river.
At the end of this pasture, there's a turkey roost up in this area.
 Do you envision a time where you'd live here all the time, or will it always be a kind of retreat?
 I think this will be more—that's an interesting conversation Laura and I have had. In my view, this will be the primary residence, and we'd have a townhouse somewhere else. I think her view might be slightly different— [
]—in which case, her view will prevail.
 Right. [
]—as much pressure as you do.
 But we do love it out here. One of the reasons we picked it— that cedar is a red cedar. Isn't that beautiful? It's unique, different from these other trees.
But this is halfway between Dallas and Austin. Most of our friends are in Dallas and Austin, so it's very convenient for our buddies to come and visit and——
 Well, you guys aren't often here by yourselves?
 What?
 You're not often here alone, are you?
 No, we're really not. We had—our friends from Lubbock came the day after we got here. And our friends from Austin came last night. It's a good chance for us to catch up with our buddies, and we really like our friends. Yes, it's wonderful.
See, up in there? For example, I haven't explored up in there yet. See the makings of an interesting rock formation? I may clear that out some so you can see it better. Haven't made up my mind. In the spring, this is just emerald green.
 Greener than usual this August.
 Pardon me?
 It was greener than usual this August.
 Yes, because of the rain.
 Mr. President, would you mind terribly if we would just let the truck pass so they can get some walking shots?
 Not at all. Heidi, what are you doing?
 I want to catch up to you. [
]
 Quite a little motorcade back there.
 Do you ever—[
]?
 A lovely walk in the woods—[
]—with motorized vehicles.
 [
]
 Yes, you do. Exactly. [
]
 If I stub my toe, what will I do? [
] [
]
 It's easy to get a sense of the kind of the relief. It's about 90 foot in here, from the highest to the lowest point. Pretty good relief.
 This part I remember, because you drove us down to here.
 But you wouldn't ever envision this, driving into the ranch.
 Right.
 That's what I like about it.
 Were these roads here, or did you build these?
 I built this one. The definition—I'll show you the definition of a road. The definition of a road is tire ruts on a ranch. And one of the things I assured Ron [Ron Fournier, Associated Press] is that we would build a road so it would become easily accessible. This is—I did not build this road. This is a road that the Engelbrechts built. But you have to maintain these things, obviously. The water will erode them out.
The deer lay down in here. They feel protected. And then the turkey were right up here.
[
]
 Make news, will you.
This is the river right here, the middle fork of the Bosque. And right across the way is our neighbor. These are bur oaks. See these huge trees there? Aren't they spectacular?
 These guys must create some nice fall foliage.
 You get pretty good color here. See the tree with the leaves still on it?
 Yes.
 That's called a bois d'arc, and it's a real hard wood that they claim the Indians used for their—[
]. They produce a big, green apple. That's a big—[
].
 So this is the line right here?
 No, this is just—[
].
It's the middle fork of the Bosque. We have a mile and a half—you'll see a creek down here.
 Do you fish the river?
 No, no. This river is real gravelly. And most of the time, you won't see water running on the surface. It runs underneath the gravel. You know, I hike up and down this river a lot, and you might run into—in August, you might run into a pool of water, but that's about it.
 So we're 2.5 miles from what, the house?
 Yes. We have walked about 2 miles.
 A little exercise in the morning.
 Absolutely.
 Is everybody happy?
 See the—that's real gravelly and shallow.
 Do you periodically have rocks spread——
 Yes, caliche, right. I did. We'll hike up out of here by a caliche pit. It's kind of a salty limestone that's used for road—[
].
 You've got it right here on the ranch?
 Yes. See out here, this is where most of the—[
]. And the creek that we're fixing to come up here, it's really hard to cross. So I built a low-water crossing. So you'll see a low-water crossing.
 [
]
 Well, "low-water" means it's not a dam. In other words——
 Like a ford?
 Yes. The water runs continuously.
 [
]—are never done, right?
 These hardwoods are taking away a source of water. On a nice, relatively calm day, we'll come down and burn.
 These cliffs are all——
 Yes, they do. We're paralleling them. We'll see some more dramatic—it's about 3 1/2 miles all throughout here in the bottoms. Engelbrecht said he has seen water coming out of the creek and the river all across here, which is why you would never build down here.
Those cedars, small cedars, were crowded up against the hardwoods and competing with the hardwoods for the water.
Some of these are pecans out here, great big pecan trees. The pecan is a fruit-bearing tree. We didn't have a very good pecan crop this year.
See the white tree over there, the white bark? That's a sycamore, and they grow in the river.
 You're quite the tree man.
 I am a tree man.
 The Audubon Society——
 Good for you. Opens up your—when I say every day is Earth Day if you own your land, you're beginning to understand what I mean.
 [

 Skinny bits and saplings?
 Those are little oaks and ashes. The sturdy will emerge. Here's where we worked yesterday. See how we opened up—that's our country over there on the right, on the other side of the creek. You couldn't see that. We opened it up, and now you have a sense of—that it's a part of our property.
 When you find all these little——
 You all right? You okay?
 Yes.
 Medical Gator. [
] The numbers are the designated points.
So, for example, so-and-so is at 50, they look on the map and find out where 50 is.
 It's not for recreation?
 No, the recreation part is the mileage.
 What are the white patches over there?
 That's where we burned.
 Burned.
 We will have seen about half the ranch. You can't cross—you'll see down here—I want you to see this river that it's just too wet to go across.
 Is this, with the marker, is this where you run?
 This is one of the trails. Some of these—we've got—this is not a trail marker; this is not a running-trail marker here. It's an intersection.
This is now the Rainy Creek. Where the Rainy Creek hits the middle fork of the Bosque is on our property, right up about a quarter mile that way. And now the Rainy Creek defines our northern border. And you'll see it up here. And there's five crossing points, and here is one of them.
 Have we been on the eastern half of the ranch?
 You have been on the eastern half of the ranch. You've seen— yes, left. I don't think we want to try to cross here, but we can stop here for a minute. I want you to see this.
[
]
 And this will run about a mile and a half this way and then go a mile and a half——
 This is not a fork where you fish?
 Actually, I put some fish in here farther up, where there's a big, deep pool. And it's fun to come down here and fly fish. There's not a lot of fish— [
].
All right, we'll hike it up this hill here. Load up. Load up. Man, you better load up. We're going up the hill.
 Oh, I'm good, sir.
 You can handle it? Holly, get in here. Now, can you handle it?
 I can, apparently. I've got to figure out how. Something to keep me occupied. [
]
 Exactly. You can read the instruction manual for a week. [
]
 That's what I did. That was one night. [
]
 [
]
 I finally recovered. These are all lacy oaks in here that you couldn't see. The cedars were crowding them out. These are going to be a beautiful stand of lacy oaks.
 We'll have to give you a nickname— [
].
 Yes, exactly. See the cliffs over there?
 Yes.
 Pretty dramatic stuff.
 Looks like good hiking in there.
 That's great hiking. There's a little hidden valley that you can go over there and—[
]. Super Stretch, caliche.
 You bulldoze it right out of there?
 Yes. This is a good one to run, in August.
 Ninety-eight degrees.
 Hundred-degree for the run.
 Reminds me too much of home. I couldn't do that.
 That's right. But 90 degrees.
 Wow, look at the hawk.
 Those are big buzzards.
 Turkey buzzards?
 Yes, turkey buzzards. They're hoping one of us drops. [
]
 [
]—reporters.
 It's good for you.
 We're not cold anymore.
 You will be, in a minute.
 Oh, because of the wind?
 Well, we're getting up top here.
 Does the little hill have a name?
 No, this one doesn't. But the next one over is Balkan Hill, for Condi Rice, who gave us the history of the Balkans in the middle of a 4-mile walk. I was impressed that she didn't break sentence during the—full up the hill.
 [
]—Bosnia and Herzegovina going up the hill here.
[
]
 See the area, right in there?
 Yes.
 That's a little hidden——
 Have you been working back there?
 We did, last year. You can walk up.
 So with all this working, do you ever sit down and——
 Relax?
 Enjoy it and relax?
 Yes, sometimes.
 This is limestone, sir?
 Yes. See how porous it is. There was a big dead tree right here, which we cut off, opened this up. We'll see—we're heading parallel to this little river, and I'll show you the headwaters of the river. It's spectacular.
Can you envision me sitting here, on the rock, writing some poetry?
 Yes.
 That's what I see pretty much—writing the State of the Union—[
]— longhand.
 That's the state of my union.
 Speaking of——
 Yes, we're working on it.
 Anything you want to sneak preview?
 I think all you've got to do is call the White House staffers. They'll tell you, evidently. [
] You know what I mean.
 My fellow Americans.
 That's what makes America great.
[
]
 Is that your property, or is that the other——
 That's us. Go straight where those agents are down there. Those are agents down there—that you're not supposed to see.
 Yes. [
]
 This is a great place to sit down and think. [
] [
]
 Be careful up here, seriously.
On a nice evening, you've got a little bit of a western view and—[
]. We've got deer—[
].
 Look out, those first steps are moving.
 Is it called—[
]—Rainy Creek?
 Yes.
 Pretty wide for a creek.
 Yes, it is, but there's a lot of water right now. But it won't be wide in a while.
 How high up are we?
 You know, I don't know how much higher—I'd say 90 feet.
All right, I just wanted you to see this. Holly?
 Yes?
 Quit calling me Jeb. [
]
[
]
 Nice story. The—[
]—and I went for a run in the campaign, summer of 2000. And we go in the pond, the river pool down there, the creek. And the next day we killed a water moccasin— cottonmouth. That's the last time we jumped in there. [
]
See the cardinals?
 Yes.
[
]
 [
]—waterfall down there. I don't know what they are.
 Isn't it pretty down here?
 [
]
 I don't know what they are, strawberries?
 Something like that. I don't know.
 [
]—wild clover. Anyway, this thing kind of meanders down. And there's a—well, you can see where it drops off. There's a waterfall down there. You've seen two of the seven canyons. And this is the one that goes up—remember that crossing where we just—this goes all the way down there and drains into the creek right at the crossing. Pretty special.
 Is there water—[
]—down there?
 I don't know what that is. I had never seen it.
 [
]
[
]
 Really? You've become kind of a matinee idol?
 That goes without saying.
 Yes, we took a vote. We'll keep him. They say he's big; he's big out there in the hinterland. Holly, do you want in?
 I think I'm okay, thank you.
 We've got about a half mile to go.
 A half mile? Maybe I'll walk.
[
]
 A lot of water coming out that creek.
 Good springs anywhere, sir?
 Well, there's—yes, they do. And a lot of the——
 Come out of the aquifers?
 Just coming out of the rock, like that one I showed you when we first went down into the bottoms there. That's what a spring is like.
This is the back side of the dam. These are all big cedar elms here—cedar elm grove.
 Do you guys like to cook at all?
 Yes.
 Do you?
 Mine?
 Yes.
 Eating. You said, "Do you guys, right?" Oh, you said, "You guys like to cook." [
] I'm pretty good with burgers, egg salad.
 Are you a fancy coffee guy or a regular——
 Fancy. I don't even know what we drink. I just say this, the stronger the better.
Here's the back side of the house.
 In all this planning, how did you pick where you wanted the house?
 We had a—the architect, David Heymann, from the University of Texas came out here. And Laura—the decision—[
]. And then David came out here—[
].
 [
]
 Winds, the sun, and the big live oak.
 [
]
 No, no. And one of the things you'll see if they have a Texas phenomenon, it's called—[
]—capture the—[
]—breezes. And in the summer, you want to be able to get as much of the breeze as you can. So the house is up high. We've got the house divided by screened porches the wind blows through.
 I didn't know you had a treehouse. [
]
 Yes, look at it. Built that for the grandkids that don't exist. Some of the fellows go up there with some high-powered binocs and high-powered weaponry.
 Yes, right.
 Here's another way down. There's, let's see, five entries with the Rainy Creek area. You know, I'd say we've been through a third of this, about half.
 So how big is the guesthouse? Is it just for one, two people?
 No, no, two beds, two baths, and a little sitting room. Then we've got the—you remember the Governor's house?
 Yes.
 That's three bedrooms, two baths. That's where Condi will stay tonight. So we've got—then Barbara and Jenna's room are at the end of the house. A lot of time they're not here. We've got one, two, three, four—eight guestrooms, if Barbara and Jenna aren't here.
 So it's plenty big.
 Yes. The Governor's house, is what we call that, is where the guy from whom we bought the property lived. Then we fixed it up.
 Yes, I remember. We had a little lunch, remember that, in 2000?
 That's right.
 That's where you were with Tommy Franks when you talked to us last year.
 That's exactly right.
 I remember Colin Powell was—[
].
 That's exactly right.
 [
]
 No, that was for the announcement, in the high school.
 What was that?
 That was for the announcement of him being Secretary of State.
 No, no, you know when you came out with Powell was—he was still—it was right after election night when we were into the recount. That's the first time you brought—and the Cheneys were here.
 Was he there?
 He was.
 He was sitting at the table.
 Oh, that's right. We talked about the cows the day we announced him as Secretary of State. It was very funny.
 This is the back of the house here?
 Back of the house. This is the northern view.
 It's beautiful.
 Thanks. This is native rock. The house is contoured so that when it rains, it drains into a 40,000-gallon cistern. We can recycle, watering all the grasses and trees around here.
 Now, are these Mrs. Bush's grasses——
 Not yet.
 So that's where you go to write the State of the Union. [
]
 Yes.
 Oh, I see, and that's the——
 That's the famous swimming pool——
 Oh, that's right.
 Which I dubbed the "whining pool," but—[
]. [
]
 Come on.
 No, I'm glad we got it. There was a lot of cajoling going on.
 [
]
 That's exactly right. That's one of those things that lasts about three sets. Oh, well, we're tired of tennis.
 It's too hot.
 Too hot.
[
]
 See how that little cedar is growing up from underneath there?
 Yes.
 That will be gone by— [
]. When we got out here to haul these trees—[
]. They say in Texas that if you were to—if you were to clear land of cedars, you'd increase the water supply by 30 percent. They're real water hogs.
 [
]
 There is a—they say a species called the—[
]—uses the old cedar to build nests. So we maintain the old cedar.
 Have you ever seen one?
 Well, this county doesn't have them, but I'm leaving them anyway. See the big oaks in here? This country is a good part of the ranch.
Here's a little tank that we—[
]—stock with bass.
 So you've got the roads numbered here, right?
 Well, these are intersections.
 I thought there was. [
]
 No, no.
 Go down to 63 and 34 and get me a——
 Exactly. [
]
 I'm warm now.
 Good. That's a really interesting stand of hard woods up in there, about 80 acres of them. Great country through here. At the very end of it is the type of canyons we've cleared out. I'd take you back there, but it's really too wet.
 Do you hunt here?
 I don't, but some of them do. They come up here—I let them come up here and take deer off and maintain the proper buck-to-doe ratio. You over-populate, you get—[
]. I don't let them shoot the turkeys.
 You love the turkeys.
 But I do let them shoot the dove. I've shot dove here. The dove season starts Labor Day, and generally we're not here.
 Sir, will you let us do a little bit of this before we go in the house?
 Yes. [
]—don't watch TV. There's my man, Barney, standing guard. [
] Do you want to do it right here?
 We'll get the camera wherever you want.
