THE EQUIPMENT of many Federal laboratories is superb and often unique. This investment should be viewed as a national resource and not one for the exclusive use of the laboratory staff members. While many scientists and engineers from universities now frequently use Federal research facilities, an even closer and more extensive cooperative relation wil be productive. I am therefore approving a policy designed to bring this about. Dr. DuBridge will be able to implement the policy with the help of the Federal Council for Science and Technology, which has recommended its adoption.
