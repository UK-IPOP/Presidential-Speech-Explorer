ON THE recommendation of the Atomic Energy Commission I am glad to approve this proposed agreement between the Republic of Turkey and the United States for cooperation in the unclassified scientific study of atomic energy and development of its peaceful uses.
This historic occasion signalizes the completion of negotiations for the first agreement for cooperation in the peaceful uses of atomic energy under the new Atomic Energy Act. It is another example of the vision of the Congress in enacting this law to meet the needs for peaceful atomic development at home and abroad. This occasion also marks another among the many instances of friendly exchange and mutual cooperation between our two nations.
Over a year ago, President Bayar of Turkey when visiting the United States made specific reference to the atoms-for-peace program and stated that "we who are dedicated to the security of the free world have no choice but to give this plan our total endorsement". The initialing of this proposed agreement marks the first major step in a new field of United States-Turkish cooperation which gives promise of wide benefits to mankind.
It augments the many evidences of mutual trust and teamwork in scientific and technical development such as the educational and other training programs we have carried on with Turkey for several years.
The proposed agreement will promptly be sent to the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy of the Congress as required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.
