"We are thrilled to have the support of the the hard-working families of the New Hampshire State Employees' Association (SEIU local 1984). John Edwards' commitment to guaranteeing universal health care, the work he has done standing shoulder-to-shoulder with organized labor and his strength as the candidate who can win the general election next year and bring a pro-union, pro-working family agenda to the White House have earned him this critical support in New Hampshire. John Edwards is proud to have the strong endorsement of the SEA and looks forward to working with the men and women of SEIU in New Hampshire to build One America where every single American has health care coverage and where everyone who works hard has the chance to get ahead."
