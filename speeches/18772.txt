 the health and prosperity of rural America have a profound effect upon the health and prosperity of the Nation; and
 accidents cause death and disability, suffering and hardship to thousands of our farm people annually and substantially reduce the productive capacity of our farming industry; and
 various individual, regional, and national farm safety activities have proved their worth in reducing the number of accidents which occur on our farms:
, President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people of the Nation, urban and rural, to observe the week beginning July 24, 1960, as National Farm Safety Week, and I urge all farm families, all organized farm groups, and all persons allied with agriculture to join their efforts to begin this new decade of the sixties with an exemplary record in farm safety.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this fifteenth day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fourth.

DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:

CHRISTIAN A. HERTER,
