My dear President Campbell:
I notice in the press this morning a statement that "Government employees and their families are prohibited from expressing publicly their views on the soldiers' bonus, under a new regulation promulgated by the Civil Service Commission."
I cannot believe that this is true, and would be glad to have a statement from you upon it.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Hon. Thomas E. Campbell, President, Civil Service Commission, Washington, D.C.]
