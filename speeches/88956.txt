 Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced the formation of the Iowa Faith and Values Steering Committee. This committee of 92 leaders will advise Governor Romney on the important social issues most affecting the people of Iowa.
"To ensure a stronger America, we must strengthen families, defend traditional marriage and promote the sanctity of human life. The men and women who will be joining our effort today are committed to defending these important values. I look forward to working with this team in bringing change to Washington," said Governor Romney.
Joining Romney for President, Chair Tom Coates said, "In the bluest of blue states, Governor Romney led the charge to defend traditional families. In the face of political adversity, he fought to protect marriage, defend the sanctity of human life and strengthen families. Governor Romney is the one candidate who has made stronger families a cornerstone of his candidacy, and we hope to ensure every Iowan knows his strong record of defending conservative values."
