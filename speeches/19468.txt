IN THE PUBLIC WORKS Appropriation Act, 1959, the Congress has included approximately $39 million in funds to initiate construction on 65 unbudgeted new project starts that will ultimately cost almost $700 million. Adding nearly $700 million to the already heavy future commitments for federal water resources projects is but another instance of irresponsibility in the expenditure of public funds. I am compelled to approve the Act, however, because it appropriates essential funds for continuing work on river and harbor, flood control, and reclamation projects that were started in previous years.
