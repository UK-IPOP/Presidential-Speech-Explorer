The purpose of this Statement of Administration Policy is to present the Administration's views on the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1993, as reported by the Committee.

The Administration supports H.R. 2118, as reported by the Appropriations Committee, but has some concerns with the bill that are discussed below. It is hoped that these concerns can be addressed in the Senate or later in the process.
