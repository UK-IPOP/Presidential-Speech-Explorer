Mr. President:
I want to welcome you to the United States and to this Capital on behalf of the American people. I think all of us, living as we do a great many thousand miles from your own country, having a different history, separated in time and space, are impressed by the efforts that you personally have made, and your people have made, to build a viable and strong economy and country.
You, as one of the youngest Presidents in the world, having those qualities which young Presidents like to possess, have demonstrated, I think, a leadership in uniting a country with different languages which had not known a sense of nationhood and community until recent years.
Your particular efforts in attempting to secure a better life for your people have made a profound impression upon us here. We are extremely glad to welcome you. We hope that you will find here in the United States things which will be of value to you in your efforts. And I can assure you that we regard your visit here as an opportunity for us to learn more about your country and its people and also about the problems and the opportunities of Africa which loom so large now on the world scene.
This is a most fortunate time, in my opinion, for you to visit us. Your country is the hinge geographically upon which much of Africa turns, and I believe it can be the hinge upon which much of Africa can turn politically and economically.
So, Mr. President, we welcome you here as the second youngest President in the world of a very young country. We welcome you here as the kind of responsible, progressive leader upon which I believe the hopes of freedom in Africa and in much of the world depends.
Mr. President, we are proud to have you as our guest.
