Pataki, who will serve as a national co-chair for Kasich for America, ended his own presidential bid at the end of 2015. Prior to his tenure as New York's 53rd Governor from 1995 to 2006, he served as Mayor of Peekskill and as a Member of the New York Assembly and Senate.
Said Pataki, "
 His record of balancing the federal budget and propelling Ohio's economic turnaround speaks to his extraordinary ability to solve problems and bring people together. Today, 
 and at the end of the day is the most qualified to serve as President of the United States."
Said Kasich, "I'm thrilled to receive Governor Pataki's endorsement. George is a formidable leader who ran his campaign with great integrity. On the campaign trail in the Governor's home state of New York, I spoke recently about our choice between the path of optimism and unity on one side and the path of division and fear on the other.Â I deeply appreciate Governor Pataki's willingness to walk alongside us on the higher path."
