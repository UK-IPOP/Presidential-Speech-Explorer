Verona, PA - Former Governor Mitt Romney talks a lot about his ability to reinvigorate our economy, but his record as Governor tells a very different story.
Hogan Gidley, National Communications Director, said: "Mitt Romney 'understands the economy?' Tell that to the people of Massachusetts. His jobs record as governor was pathetic - and this is just another instance where the Romney rhetoric doesn't meet reality. Romney World can talk about job creation all they want, but here in the real world he failed the people of Massachusetts." 
 "The parallels between Massachusetts then and the country as a whole now point to the same central problem that has dogged the U.S. economy the last three times it's climbed out of a recession: The recovery hasn't created enough jobs."

 "In fact, Massachusetts had the weakest employment growth of any state from 2002 to 2006 except for Mississippi and Louisiana, which suffered the brunt of Hurricane Katrina, and Michigan itself, which was buffeted by the auto industry's woes."

 "When Romney took office, there were 3,224,600 nonfarm seasonally adjusted jobs in Massachusetts. When he left office, there were 3,270,400, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That means under Romney's economic policies Massachusetts saw a net gain of only 45,800 jobs; a growth rate of 1.42 percent. Other estimates vary. For example, the Massachusetts Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development estimates job growth of 51,400 over that period. But in another analysis by Moody's Economy.com, the number was lower: only 24,400." (Matt Lewis, "Mitt Romney's Jobs Record Worse Than Michael Dukakis,'"

 "The data are even more problematic when Romney's record is compared to one of his predecessors, Michael Dukakis. On average Dukakis created roughly 45,209 jobs per year while he served as Governor of the Commonwealth, a total of 497,300 net new jobs from 1976 through 1979 and 1983 through 1991, according to Labor and Workforce. ... By contrast, Romney - who is also making job creation a centerpiece of his presidential campaign - created only an average of 12,850 per year between 2003 and 2007."

 "'The fact that he let his commissioner of revenue go on a rampage to raise corporate taxes suggests to me he wasn't being very energetic about translating his pro-business viewpoint into action,' said David Tuerck, executive director of the Beacon Hill Institute, a pro-business research group."
