Top officials of the Veterans of Foreign Wars have wired Senator John F. Kennedy telling him that "your fellow veterans respect and understand your giving priority to your constructive legislation program" rather than coming to Detroit to address the VFW convention.
These officials said that while they will "miss having you at the national VFW convention" they were "dedicated to the election of John F. Kennedy for the President of the United States."
The signators of the telegram were: John W. Mahan, committee coordinator, past national commander in chief; Heyman Rothoart, judge advocate, department of New York, VFW; Robert A. Durkee, national council member, Montana, Idaho, and Washington; Walter H. Marshall, National Security Committee of Helena, Mont.; John F. McKelvey, chairman, Veterans' Affairs Commission of Texas; E. K. Collins, National Council Administration, Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States.
Senator Kennedy said he was gratified at receiving the message. "I know that responsible veterans are united with me in the desire to get a constructive job done here for our country. While it would have been much easier for me to go to Detroit, clear duty was to remain here on the floor of the U.S. Senate."
