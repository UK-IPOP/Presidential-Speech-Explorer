The Administration supports Senate passage of S. 2638 at a higher authorization level than was reported by the Committee on Armed Services. The Administration also supports the adoption of amendments to:




— authorize the Small Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (SICBM) program at the Administration's request of $1,375.5 million because the SICBM is to be a critical component of the U.S. deterrent in the 1990's and delaying the program would significantly weaken that deterrent;

— delete the limitation and the allocated reduction for the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) and authorize the Initiative at the Administration's request of $5. 3 billion;






— delete the provision prohibiting the award of Department of Defense contracts in excess of $100,000 to firms controlled by foreign governments if the determination is made that the contract award would be inconsistent with U.S. foreign policy or national security objectives. As drafted, the provision would considerably complicate the procurement process, cause the violation of our international trade obligations and be difficult to implement;




— authorize a maintenance and support center at Andrews AFB and a support complex at the Anacostia Naval Station, both of which are vital projects of the highest priority; and

— authorize military construction at the Administration's request of $24.5 million for the Aircraft Refueling Project in Morocco in order to fulfill the United States obligations under its Memorandum of Understanding with Morocco, which was signed July 18, 1986.
In addition to the above-noted concerns, the Administration may seek to have certain features of the bill modified in conference to more closely conform to its request.
