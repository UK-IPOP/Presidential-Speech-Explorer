The President has asked me to communicate to each of you his plan for managing the Federal regulatory process at the outset of his Administration. In order to ensure that the President's appointees have the opportunity to review any new or pending regulations, I ask on behalf of the President that you immediately take the following steps:
As used in this memorandum, "regulation" has the meaning set out in section 3(e) of Executive Order 12866. That is, this plan covers "any substantive action by an agency (normally published in the Federal Register) that promulgates or is expected to lead to the promulgation of a final rule or regulation, including notices of inquiry, advance notices of proposed rulemaking, and notices of proposed rulemaking."
This regulatory review will be implemented by the Director or Acting Director of the OMB. Communications regarding exceptions to the review, or questions regarding the review generally, should be addressed to that individual.
Finally, in the interest of sound regulatory practice and the avoidance of costly, burdensome, or unnecessary regulation, independent agencies are encouraged to participate voluntarily in this review.
This memorandum shall be published in the Federal Register.
