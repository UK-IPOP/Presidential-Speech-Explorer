"Four years ago, Barack Obama promised middle-class families they wouldn't see a tax hike if he was elected president. He was wrong. President Obama's disastrous health-care law raises taxes on millions of middle-class Americans, and his fiscally irresponsible policies could raise middle-class taxes by another $4,000 while jeopardizing over 700,000 jobs. Mitt Romney will cut taxes for all Americans and create a simpler, fairer tax code to help jumpstart the economy." — Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman
 OBAMA: "My definition -- here's what I can tell the American people: 95 percent of you will get a tax cut. And if you make less than $250,000, less than a quarter-million dollars a year, then you will not see one dime's worth of tax increase." (Sen. Barack Obama,

 "Currently that would work out to $55,850 or less for an individual and $115,250 or less for a family of four. Average penalty: about $1,200 in 2016." (

 "In a new paper, AEI's Matt Jensen looks at the real annual cost of servicing the debt for households at various levels of income — including a potentially higher tax burden. As the table below illustrates, a household making between $100,000 and $200,000 a year could find its tax liability higher by roughly $2,400 every year. Over ten years, that works out to $24,000. And when you add in the debt already accrued the past four years under President Obama (the second table), that's another $1,600 a year. So now we are now talking about $4,000 a year, $40,000 over ten years." (

 "Researchers determined the plan would actually subject 2.1 million business owners to higher rates; specifically, those who pay pass-through taxes, like most partnerships, LLCs and S-Corporations. The result, less capital in the hands of business owners and diminished labor supply, would cost the United States an estimated $200 billion in economic output and 710,000 jobs." (
