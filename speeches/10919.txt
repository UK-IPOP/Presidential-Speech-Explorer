IN RESPONSE to the President's request, the Federal Bureau of Roads has completed a canvass of the whole roads program of the country, with a view to determining the volume of construction during the current calendar year in its relation to employment.
This inquiry reveals that Federal aid for 1931 is $259,897,000, as compared with $105,648,000 for 1930, an increased Federal program of $154,249,000. It shows as well that expenditures during the year 1931 for Federal aid, State and local roads combined, will be $1,616 million, as compared with an expenditure of $1,601 million for the calendar year 1930, an increase of $15 million.
