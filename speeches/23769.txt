 the United Nations' vigor and effectiveness have increased over the years; and
 the United Nations has become the principal forum for open discussion of world affairs; and
 the United Nations is now an effective instrument against hunger, illiteracy, disease, and despair; and
 the United Nations is a main avenue for cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space; and
 the United Nations' peacekeeping potential provides a key to world disarmament; and
 the United Nations' activities have been beneficial to the national interests of the United States; and
 the United Nations' authority depends on the moral and financial support of the world's nations and people; and
 the General Assembly of the United Nations has resolved that October twenty-fourth, the anniversary of the coming into force of the United Nations Charter, should be dedicated each year to making known the purposes, principles, and accomplishments of the United Nations:
 President of the United States of America, do hereby urge the citizens of this Nation to observe Wednesday, October 24, 1962, as United Nations Day by means of community programs which will demonstrate their faith in the United Nations and contribute to a better understanding of its aims, problems, and accomplishments.
I also call upon the officials of the Federal and State Governments and upon local officials to encourage citizen groups and agencies of the press, radio, television, and motion pictures to engage in appropriate observance of United Nations Day throughout the land in cooperation with the United States Committee for the United Nations and other organizations.
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this thirtieth day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-sixth.
