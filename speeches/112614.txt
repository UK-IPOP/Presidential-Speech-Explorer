"Before he tells Congress what it should do, President Obama should follow through on his own 'to-do' list that he outlined nearly four years ago in Denver. After more than three years of liberal policies that have driven up debt and wasteful spending, no amount of 'to-do' lists can hide the fact that the President's policies have failed to make life better for the millions of Americans who are struggling in the Obama economy." â€“Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 "Pressuring Congress, President Barack Obama is laying out an election year 'to do' list Tuesday that urges lawmakers to take another look at economic proposals to promote job creation and help families refinance their mortgages. ... Obama's wish list includes a number of proposals that he has outlined previously but have failed to gain traction in Congress." (Ken Thomas, "Obama's 'To Do' List For Congress: Jobs, Mortgages,"

 OBAMA: "We measure the strength of our economy ... by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off and look after a sick kid without losing her job, an economy that honors the dignity of work." (Senator Barack Obama, 
, Denver, CO, 8/28/08)
 OBAMA: "But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy." (Senator Barack Obama,
