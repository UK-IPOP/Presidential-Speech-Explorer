To the Congress of the United States:
I transmit to the Congress, for its information and consideration, the First Report of the Air Coordinating Committee, for the calendar year 1946.
The Committee was established by Executive Order on September 19, 1946, in order to achieve full development and integration of United States aviation policies and activities, and includes representatives of the executive agencies primarily concerned with aviation. Through its Aviation Industry Advisory Panel, the Committee draws upon the experience and the views of the air transport and aircraft manufacturing industry, of organized labor, and of other aviation interests.
It is my hope that the Report may prove useful to the Congress in its deliberations on aviation matters, which are of such great concern to our country's welfare.
