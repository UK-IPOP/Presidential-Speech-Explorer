AUSTIN â€” Rep. Ron Paul's newly released attack ad refers to the congressman as, "the one who stood with Reagan." But his 1987 letter announcing his resignation from the Republican Party indicates Reagan drove him from the party.
"Ronald Reagan was one of the most significant presidents of our generation, and a proven fiscal conservative," Perry spokesman Mark Miner said. "Like President Reagan, Gov. Perry has cut taxes and freed employers from government regulations that kill jobs."
"Rep. Paul's letter is a broadside attack on every element of President Reagan's record and philosophy. Paul thought President Reagan was so bad, he left the GOP," said Miner. "It will be interesting to hear Rep. Paul explain why Reagan drove him from the party at tomorrow's debate on the grounds of the Reagan Library."
In one part of the letter, Paul wrote, "There is no credibility left for the Republican Party as a force to reduce the size of government. That is the message of the Reagan years."
Paul continued, "Thanks to the President and Republican Party, we have lost the chance to reduce the deficit and the spending in a non-crisis fashion. Even worse, big government has been legitimized in a way the Democrats never could have accomplished."
Paul even went so far as to call Reaganomics, "warmed-over Keynesianism."
Paul summarizes his reason for leaving the Republican Party with the following tirade: "I want to totally disassociate myself from the policies that have given us unprecedented deficits, massive monetary inflation, indiscriminate military spending, an irrational and unconstitutional foreign policy, zooming foreign aid, the exaltation of international banking, and the attack on our personal liberties and privacy."
