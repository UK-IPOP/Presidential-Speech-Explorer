WASHINGTON -- A week after Ida's landfall in Louisiana, FEMA and federal agencies, along with non-profit organizations, continue supporting state and tribal governments with their ongoing response and recovery efforts in several states from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast that were affected by the storm.
 FEMA has provided more than $135 million in grants to Louisiana survivors to help them begin their recovery. FEMA also received more than 8,600 National Flood Insurance Program claims from the affected states for processing.

More than 1,000 FEMA employees are deployed to support Ida response and recovery efforts along the Gulf Coast and in the Northeast. Additionally, FEMA staff are working throughout the nation to support other ongoing response efforts, including flooding throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast and wildfires in the West.

To help support response efforts in Louisiana, FEMA is working with the state to contract for additional responder lodging resources. These efforts may include using cruise ships or building temporary base camps so that responders can help recovery efforts in the area without taking valuable hotel resources from survivors.
