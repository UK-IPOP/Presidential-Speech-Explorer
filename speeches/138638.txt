Today, ahead of the general election, 
unveiled a new website that underscores and illustrates a central theme of Joe Biden's campaign: unifying the country. The Democratic primary presented voters a historic field of candidates that reflect the widespread talent, diversity, and strength of our party and country, which is why Joe Biden worked hard to assemble the broadest and most diverse coalition to ensure we make Donald Trump a one term president. Today's new website reflects Biden's long standing commitment to unity and welcoming all kinds of supporters to Team Joe, drawing inspiration from key design elements used by former presidential candidates and adding new features that will reach more Americans.


 


 New design elements inspired by former candidates include:


The website also uses the campaign's new fonts, Decimal and Mercury, and is a gesture to another central campaign theme around the battle for the soul of the nation, which must be won by choosing truth over lies. Decimal's main inspiration comes from the typefaces used in wristwatches â€” true as time. Mercury's primary use has been used in print, for various magazines and newspapers, and holds the truth of the written word. Additionally, there is a new video bumper that will automatically load on any JoeBiden.com page when Joe Biden is speaking live during events hosted by the campaign.

The new website strives to reach more Americans with expanded features:


The website was designed and engineered entirely in-house by 
 staff.
