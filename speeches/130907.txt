The Administration supports House passage of H.J. Res. 123, the Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018.
This legislation funds the Federal Government at current spending levels without unnecessary extraneous provisions through December 22, 2017, while the Congress continues to work on a longer-term funding agreement. The legislation also includes language to ensure that States and Territories have adequate funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) through December.
The Administration believes that funding for national security, including for our military, to secure the Southern Border, and to enhance missile defense capabilities, must be prioritized in a long-term funding agreement, and will continue working with the Congress to achieve that goal.
