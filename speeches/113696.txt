 ABC's JAKE TAPPER: "Well, I've covered President Obama for about six or seven years now and I've seen him inspire crowds of tens of thousands and then I also recall the summer of 2007 when he was listless and flat and uninspired and his campaign manager had to knock some sense in him and get him back in the game. Unfortunately for the Obama campaign that's the Obama I saw on the stage tonight. It was not a strong performance by him." (ABC, 10/3/12)
 "On Wednesday night, Mitt Romney attempted a hostile takeover of the presidential campaign ... dominating President Obama." (
, 10/3/12)
 "How tough a night was it for the incumbent? He even muffed some of the basics of Debate 101, struggling to find the right camera to address once or twice during the mostly civil 90-minute exchange." (

 (
, 10/3/12)
 "Mitt Romney came out swinging in the first presidential debate, challenging President Obama over his health care reforms, treatment of the economy, taxes and funding for Sesame Street's Big Bird." (
, 10/3/12)
 "For weeks, President Obama's advisers have been lowering expectations for the debate tonight, both privately and publicly forecasting that the Commander in Chief could deliver a dud. Maybe the expectations weren't low enough." (
, 10/3/12)
 "Well, I'm with all the other talking heads: Mitt Romney won this debate. Barack Obama lost it. I mean, he got his butt kicked. It was, in fact, one of the most inept performances I've ever seen by a sitting President." (
, 10/3/12)
 "Romney made the most focused appeal to middle-class voters on the basis of how his agenda would help them -- on energy, on health care, on jobs -- that he ever has." (
, 10/4/12)
 "Appearing on stage alongside the incumbent Democrat for the first time, the Republican nominee appeared relaxed, in command of facts and persistently on the offensive during the 90-minute encounter at the University of Denver. Obama, who has not debated in four years, looked rusty and found himself responding to the policy agenda set by Romney." (

 MATTHEWS: "I don't know what [President Obama] was doing out there, he had his head down, he was enduring the debate rather than fighting it." (MSNBC, 10/3/12)
 "I think the president created a big problem for him tonight, for himself. I don't think he explained himself very well on the economy. I thought he was off his game. I was absolutely stunned tonight. Rachel, you just mentioned about time, the president needs to get in and fight for that time. There's people that expect him to fight for that time." (MSNBC's "Presidential Debate 2012," 10/3/12)
 "Overall, Romney looked like a man who'd gone to every class, pulled all-nighters, done work for extra credit and came prepared to ace the exam. He did it without sweating and by ignoring the proctor. He came to fight." (
, 10/4/12)
 "In the wake of the drubbing Romney just delivered to President Obama, I can't think a better way to describe tonight's contest. Christie was right. This whole race has indeed been turned upside down." (
