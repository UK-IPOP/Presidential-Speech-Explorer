Mt. Pleasant, SC - The Rick Santorum for President campaign has received the endorsement of Maggie Gallagher, the former Chairman of the Board of the National Organization for Marriage.
In an email to her supporters, Gallagher said:
Rick Santorum was one of the original authors of the Federal Marriage Amendment and is widely credited for pushing for the only vote on the Federal Marriage Amendment in the United States Senate. Senator Santorum was also the only 2012 presidential contender to campaign in Iowa against the State Supreme Court justices who redefined marriage.
