Mr. President:
I want to express, on behalf of all of the members of our party, our deep gratitude again for the great hospitality you have extended to us and that we have received from the French people.
On this occasion, as I leave this country and go to Rome, and then back to Washington tonight, I am very pleased to announce that President de Gaulle has accepted an invitation to visit the United States. He will visit Washington sometime in January or February at a time that is mutually convenient for our two schedules.
We look forward to seeing him there again, and I am delighted that he was able to work this visit into his schedule.
