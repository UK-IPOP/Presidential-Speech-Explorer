My dear Mrs. Ziegler:
I am deeply interested to be reminded that March 1st will mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the foundation of Matilda Ziegler Magazine for the Blind, and I wish to express my deep sense of the wonderful blessing this work has been to those whose darkness has been lightened through this printed eye opening upon the outer world and supplied to them through your generosity and warm human sympathy. For yourself I wish the fullest measure of every blessing.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
