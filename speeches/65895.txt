The Administration supports judicial review of agencies' regulatory flexibility analyses. The Administration, however, has concerns about a one-year statute of limitations where a shorter period of review for the final agency action is provided by law. Moreover, the statute of limitations should begin after the publication date of the regulation, not the effective date.

The Administration also supports the concept of legislative branch accountability for regulations and, for that reason, has endorsed a limited period of review by the Congress of rules before they take effect. The Administration, however, opposes extending this review period from the 45 days provided in the Senate-passed bill (S. 219) to 60 days in this legislation, and objects to its retroactive application.

The Administration is committed to administrative review of existing regulations and to eliminating those that are outdated, ineffective, or unduly burdensome. The substitute amendment to H.R. 994, however, does not provide an effective or workable means of achieving this goal. The Administration strongly opposes the administrative review provisions in H.R. 994 because, among other things:

On the basis of these objections, if the substitute amendment to H.R. 994 were presented to the President with the provisions regarding administrative review of existing regulations, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Secretaries of Agriculture, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, the Interior, Labor, Transportation, the Treasury, and Veterans Affairs, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and would recommend that it be vetoed.
