THE President today approved the suggestion made by the Secretary of Commerce that, in view of the rapid development of aviation in several Federal branches, an inter-departmental study should be made for the purpose of establishing a uniform Federal aviation policy.
The study would seek to ascertain to what extent coordination may be effected and greater efficiency attained in promoting and fostering aviation for military, commercial, air mail and private flying purposes.
The study also would endeavor to determine to what extent aviation may be utilized by all governmental agencies with the view to saving time and money.
The President authorized Secretary Roper to initiate the study in cooperation with Members of the Cabinet who are charged with the various phases of aviation.
