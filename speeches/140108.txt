Pool Reports by 
, 




Good morning from the White House.

Pool is unaware of any changes to the President's public schedule from the guidance last night: "THE PRESIDENT has no public events scheduled." 


No changes to the President's schedule to report. 


Apologies, your pooler was duped by some prankster. There is NOT a TRAVEL PHOTO LID.

On Camera

James S. Brady Briefing Room 


And just to clarify for those of you who have asked, this 630 event is not open press.

The president walked out to the briefing room at 6:47, accompanied by White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany.

He exited the room at 7:03 to a hail of shouted questions, which he did not answer. 


Your pooler double checked with the press office and this is, indeed, an official lid.

Apologies for the earlier error.
