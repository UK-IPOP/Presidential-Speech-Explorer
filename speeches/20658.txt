I WANT to express our great pleasure at participating in the swearing in of Mr. Fowler Hamilton to be the head of the new AID program. And it is a great pleasure to have the Justice join us in making this ceremony legal.
Mr. Hamilton assumes a major responsibility, and I am delighted that he has accepted it. Our hopes are very high for this Agency, and I think that his assumption of responsibility gets us off to a most promising start.
I am glad that the members of his family are here also.
