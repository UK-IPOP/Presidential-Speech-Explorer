Good morning from Phnom Penh, where your pool has been covid tested and swept. There is lots of chatter about Nevada being called this morning (or Saturday evening in DC).
We are getting ready to depart to the Sokha Hotel for President Biden's second and final day at ASEAN. Schedule below:
In the morning, the President will participate in the East Asia Summit in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. This event at the Sokha Hotel, Phnom Penh, Cambodia will be covered by the out-of-town pool.
In the afternoon, the President will hold meetings and a trilateral meeting with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan and President Yoon Suk-yeol of the Republic of Korea to continue enhancing trilateral cooperation throughout the Indo-Pacific, particularly in regard to our joint efforts to address the ongoing threat posed by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs. The trilateral meeting will have an out-of-town pool spray.
In the evening, the President will travel to Bali, Indonesia for the G20 Leaders' Summit. In Bali, the President will commend President Widodo's leadership of the G20 and highlight the U.S. commitment to this premier forum for economic cooperation with countries representing more than 80% of the world's GDP. He will work with G20 partners to address key challenges such as climate change, the global impact of Putin's war on Ukraine, including on energy and food security and affordability, and a range of other priorities important to the global economic recovery and building a sustainable and inclusive global economy. The departure from Phnom Penh International Airport, Phnom Penh, Cambodia and the arrival to Ngurah Rai International Airport, Bali, Indonesia will be covered by the out-of-town pool.
 
We have unplanned remarks from the president coming at his hotel. Not yet clear if there will be a livestream but pool will send quotes ASAP.
Biden finished his remarks just before 10:40 am local time. He took a couple questions from reporters. More quotes coming in just a couple minutes but here are a couple rough ones:
"I feel good and I'm looking forward to the next couple years." (On holding the senate)
On whether he's coming into the meeting Xi in a stronger position now: "I know I'm coming in stronger. ... I've always had straight forward discussions with him."
From the White House:
The President made congratulatory calls this morning from Phnom Penh, Cambodia to Senator Catherine Cortez Masto at 10:08 AM local time and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer at 10:28 AM local time.
Apologies, I sent two travel reports labeled 3 so this is #5. Many, many thanks to co-poolers Geoff Earle and Patsy Widakuswara for enormous help with quotes.
Audio was hard to hear so please check against transcript
He congratulated Sen. Schumer and said their focus now is on Georgia. "I'm not surprised by this. .. I think it's a reflection of the quality of our candidates."
"It's always better at 51." He mentioned that with 51, Democrats don't need to have an even makeup of committees.
"It's just simply better." (Having 51 vs 50 seats)
"Republicans are going to have to decide who they are."
"We're also going to break down what happened with the court case (on student debt)."
On going into the meeting with Xi stronger: "I know I'm coming in stronger ... we know that his circumstances have changed."
"I know Xi Jinping, he knows me." Said they have always had "straightforward discussions."
"We have very little misunderstanding. We just gotta figure out what the red lines are."

There was a lot of pushing and shoving from other countries' press pools. President Biden said "this is conflict, look at this" and "gentlemen, calm down a little bit." At the end of the spray said something to the effect of "if we can get out without getting hurt, that would be good."
We are rolling to the airport ahead of our departure to Bali.
These are rough quotes so please check against the transcript. Many thanks to co-poolers Geoff Earle and Patsy Widakuswara for help with quotes.
Biden spoke first and extended condolences to South Korea for the Halloween parade that killed hundreds of people.
"Japan and the Republic of Korea are critical allies of the United States."
He said North Korea has continued its "provocative" behavior and "this partnership is more important than it's ever been."
Said they would discuss a number of issues, including supply chain issues and "How we can preserve peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait."
"How we can expand our coordinated support in Ukraine" and how we can work towards a "common goal of a free and open Indo-Pacific."
"Our countries are more aligned than ever."
Japanese PM Kishida went next:
Also extended condolences to South Korea.
Said we can assume there could be more coming from North Korea so it's "extremely timely" that the three leaders were meeting.
Finally South Korean President Yoon Suk-Yeol went:
He mentioned that two Americans and two Japanese died in the South Korean stampede. "You have given us warm words of condolences."
Said the current developments in the Korean Peninsula "require the strongest level of our trilateral cooperation."
Noted that North Korea has launched some 50 missiles since he took office in May and stepped up its aggression in October.
"At a time when South Koreans are grieving in deep sorrow, North Korea continues its provocations."
