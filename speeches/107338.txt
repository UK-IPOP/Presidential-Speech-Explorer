"While serving as speaker, Newt Gingrich created a tidal wave of earmarks that conservatives have been battling ever since. Very simply, Speaker Gingrich played politics with taxpayer money. Now he's trying to convince voters that he's a fiscal conservative. Rick Perry put it best when he called Speaker Gingrich the 'granddaddy of earmarks.'" -Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokeswoman
 "Over the next four years, while Gingrich was speaker, the number of earmarks doubled to more than 6,000 projects, while total earmark spending increased by more than 30 percent, according to data from the Congressional Research Service. 'If you take care of the members, they can take care of themselves back home. That was the philosophy,' said former Republican congressman Robert Walker (Pa.), who served as vice chairman of the House Budget Committee at the time."

 "Earmarks are amendments to legislation that direct funds for specific projects, often in the home district of the member requesting them. The use of earmarks took off under Gingrich and continued to escalate over the next decade, peaking at $31 billion for 11,320 projects in 2010, according to congressional data."

 "Newt Gingrich may have played a leading role in the growth of earmarking when as speaker he maneuvered then-representative Bob Livingston of Louisiana to the appropriations chairmanship. Together they helped establish the earmark as the modern congressman's favorite tool of seduction." (Kenneth Y. Tomlinson, "Lend Me Your Earmarks,"

 "Gingrich in a memo earlier this year directed that spending bills be crafted with an eye toward how they might help Republican incumbents. Drafters were asked: 'Are there any Republican members who could be severely hurt by the bill or need a specific district item in the bill?'"

, 9/28/96)
 "In one May 1996 memo, for example, Gingrich's office asked powerful committee chairmen to include earmarks for members facing tough reelection bids that year â€” projects that would help them curry favor with their constituents. 'Are there any Republican members who could be severely hurt by the bill or who need a specific district item in the bill?' the memo asked, referring to appropriations legislation."
