Verona, PA - This past week, Republican Presidential candidate Rick Santorum emerged as the clear, conservative alternative to moderate Mitt Romney, while former Congressman Newt Gingrich continues losing ground.
Hogan Gidley, National Communications Director, said: "Time brings clarity, and this week proved that former speaker Gingrich was simply not up to the task of being the conservative alternative to Mitt Romney. Rick Santorum has a long, tried-and-true track record of unapologetically standing up for the conservative principles that make America great. He's the full spectrum conservative who's never wavered on our core principles. It is Rick Santorum who conservatives can rally around as their standard bearer, and poll-after-poll is now showing that the two-man race is now between Santorum and Romney."
Conservative leader Rush Limbaugh summed up the view of many conservatives this week when he said that all the Republican candidates have transgressions against conservatism... "except Santorum." To listen to Limbaugh's analysis:
