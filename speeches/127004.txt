The crowd at the rally skewed young and was diverse by Minnesota standards. Rubio was very sharp. He was relaxed and bantered easily with the crowd, which sometimes was borderline rowdy. . . I don't think there were many undecided voters at today's event, but any who were there had to be impressed.


Thanks for signing our son Nathanael's Dolphins jersey today in Minneapolis,
