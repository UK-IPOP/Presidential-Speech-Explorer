I AM grieved to learn of the death of Congressman William J. Green who was not only my personal friend but an effective and able leader in the halls of Congress. The people of Philadelphia who reelected him time after time and the people of the Nation whom he served so well will mourn his passing.
Mrs. Johnson joins me in sending our condolences to Mrs. Green and the family.
