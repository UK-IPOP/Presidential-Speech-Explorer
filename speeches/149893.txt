Pool entered a room at the chief mission residence, where the VP was seated at a table with Japanese executives, at 10:17 am.
Rahm Emanuel kicked off the discussion immediately after pool walked in.
VP spoke of the economic partnership between the US and Japan, the disruptions to supply chain caused by the pandemic and explained the provisions within the CHIPS Act.
Pool arrived here separately from VP, walked here (it's a block away from the RON).
Pool left the room at 10:23 am. We will be holding for a about an before heading to her next event at the naval base. Pool will be driving there and getting ahead of VP, who will be taking a helicopter.
The CHIPS event was live-streamed so won't be sending quotes.
Today, Vice President will convene a group of Japanese business executives from companies in the semiconductor industry for a discussion on the CHIPS and Science Act that the President signed into law.
There will be 3 key topics: (1) investments in manufacturing in the United States (2) supply chain resilience, and the importance of diversification to protect from disruptions and (3) research and development, and how we will take the strong-history of collaboration to the next level with this new law.
The Vice President will outline how we are making a down payment on leadership in semiconductors and how she sees Japan playing a critical role in that.
The Vice President held a similar roundtable with business executives in Singapore -- on supply chain resiliency, and on collaboration between business and governments. This continues to be an area of focus for the Vice President, both domestically and internationally. The conversation will be moderated by Ambassador Rahm Emanuel.
