 the hereinafter-described lands in the State of Oregon have been found by the Secretaries of Agriculture and of the Interior to be chiefly valuable for national-forest purposes; and

 it appears that the addition of such lands to the Deschutes National Forest would be in the public interest:
 President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the power vested In me by the aforesaid act of February 2, 1922, as amended, do proclaim that the following-described lands in the State of Oregon are hereby added to, and reserved as a part of, the Deschutes National Forest:

Executive Order No. 5082 of March 22, 1929, withdrawing the public lands within certain areas in Oregon for classification, is hereby revoked as to the following-described lands, which have been classified as not of a national forest character:
