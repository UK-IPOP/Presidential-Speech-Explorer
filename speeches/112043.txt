Today, Romney for President released a new web video, "Jolt." Last Friday, the unemployment rate rose to 8.2 percent and 300,000 more people joined the long-term unemployed. One week later, President Obama said the private sector is doing fine. Only a president that presides over forty months of unemployment over 8 percent would think that the last jobs report is "doing fine." These comments show that President Obama is completely out of touch with the middle class.
: 
 "I'm Mitt Romney and I approve this message."
 
 "Tonight on World News: Jobs Jolt, the worst jobs number in a year."
 
 "May jobs report just came out and the numbers are not good."
 "Investors react to May's dismal jobs report."
 "Unemployment rate up to 8.2 percent."
 "The jobs losses: construction—huge—down 28,000."
 "69,000 is way down."
 "We added 300,000 more long-term unemployed."
 "A tragedy for people out there who are still looking for work."
 "Just a bad, bad number."
 "But overall here, nowhere to really hide given this report."
 "The private sector is doing fine. Where we're seeing weaknesses in our economy have to do with state and local government."
 "The private sector is doing fine." (President Barack Obama, 
 Washington, DC, 6/8/12)
