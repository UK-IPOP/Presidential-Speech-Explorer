>From WH's Judd Deere...

Today's signing will take place at The Lee Dining Room Table from Blair House.

President Truman held weekly luncheon meetings with his cabinet at this dining room table. Discussions at this table helped to chart the progress of American diplomacy - fundamentals embodied in the Marshall Plan and Truman Doctrine were discussed at this table. The legacy of high-level meetings continues, as this table is now in the Lee Dining Room of the Blair House, the President's Guest House - where visits are exclusively reserved for meetings presided over by the guest chief of state or head of government. It has also served new and former First Families when they stay at Blair House for inaugurations and state funerals.

The chairs for the signing are from the current Cabinet Room in the White House. 


POTUS and leaders walked away from signing table at 1:38pm.

Marine One touched down at JBA at 4:04 p.m.

President Donald Trump exited and boarded Air Force One at 4:07 p.m.

Also spotted boarding: McEnany, Hicks, Scavino, Meadows.

Taking off soon for Philadelphia. 


Air Force One left the ground at 4:15 p.m. - touched down hard in Philadelphia at 4:40 p.m.

President Trump disembarked at 4:57 p.m., spoke briefly with some guests who greeted him, and entered the limo.

The motorcade will soon be headed downtown to the National Constitution Center, site of the ABC town hall.

A list of greeters at the airport, per the White House:
Martina White
State Representative for Pennsylvania's 170th Legislative District

Lou Barletta
Former United States Representative from Pennsylvania

John McNesby
President, Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police 


Motorcade rolled from the tarmac at 5:01 p.m.

We arrived at the National Constitution Center at 5:13 p.m.

After exiting the airport, a line of uniformed officers stood at attention and saluted the motorcade as it rolled past. Don't know where those officers were from.

No issues during the motorcade. It took freeways into downtown, which was not very crowded - there were more police than pedestrians, most of whom took video and snapshots of the motorcade.

We are now in a holding room - it doesn't look like we will get access to the taping of the town hall. 


The town hall taping is just about done and the travel pool is packing up at 6:30 p.m.

We had no access to the event, which ABC will broadcast starting at 9 p.m., eastern.

Also: The White House passes along that a fourth person greeted President Trump at the airport earlier in the day:

John Bland

Business Manager and Secretary Treasurer, Boilermakers Local 13

Repeating from previous pool report: Other greeters at the airport, per the White House:

Martina White
State Representative for Pennsylvania's 170th Legislative District

Lou Barletta
Former United States Representative from Pennsylvania

John McNesby
President, Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police 


Motorcade pulled away from the National Constitution Center at 6:51 p.m.

Lots of police lined the streets leading to the freeway. Motorcade raced past the ballpark, where the lights were on ahead of the (fan-less) Phillies-Mets game.

Arrived at airport at 7:03 p.m.

A few Trump fans gathered near the airfield entrance.

President Trump boarded Air Force One quickly.

Taking off soon for JBA 


Air Force One lifted off from Philadelphia at 7:13 p.m.

Touched down at JBA at 7:39 p.m.

Uneventful flight (though President Trump tweeted out a picture of himself with a large Philly cheesesteak).

Trump exited AF1 at 7:50 p.m. He boarded Marine One and it took off from JBA at 7:56 p.m.

Over and out.
