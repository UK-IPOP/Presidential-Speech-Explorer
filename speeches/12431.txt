 it appears that certain lands within the State of Georgia, acquired by the United States, under the authority of the National Industrial Recovery Act, approved July 16, 1933 (48 Stat. 195), and the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935, approved April 8, 1935 (49 Stat. 115), are suitable for forest purposes; and
 it appears that it will be in the public interest to reserve such lands for national-forest purposes, and that they can be effectively and economically administered as part of the Chattahoochee National Forest, Georgia, established by Proclamation of July 9, 1936 (1 F.R. 776):
, President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 24 of the act of March 3, 1891, 26 Stat. 1095, 1103, as amended (16 U.S.C., sec. 471), the act of June 4, 1897, 30 Stat. 34, 36 (16 U.S.C., sec. 473), the said National Industrial Recovery Act, and the said Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935, do proclaim that the following-described lands are hereby included in and reserved as part of the said Chattahoochee National Forest:
Tracts Nos. 490a, 360, 360a, 861, 332, 131c, and 215d, of the Piedmond Project (LA-GA-3), Georgia, as shown on the accompanying diagram which is made a part hereof.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this seventh day of December in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-second.
