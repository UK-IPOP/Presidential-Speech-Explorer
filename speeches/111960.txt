Today, Romney for President released a new web video, "Soul Mate." On World Multiple Sclerosis Day, Ann Romney and her family share their thoughts on her struggle with the disease. Ann and her sons also recount Mitt's undying support to the woman he calls his "soul mate."
: 
 "When I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, both of us just dissolved in tears."
 "Probably the toughest time in my life was standing there with Ann as we hugged each other and the diagnosis came."
 "My life was in jeopardy and I was, like, as vulnerable as a person could be. I was frightened. Mitt was frightened, but I needed him desperately."
 "I think it affected my dad as much as it affected my mom."
 "He really stepped up. He let her be sick, let her take the time that she needed."
 "My dad not only said to my mom that I'll be there for you. I'll do everything. You don't need to worry, but he did that."
 "She said 'I'm not going to be able to do the things that I used to do.' He said, 'I don't care.'"
 "This is something they would be able to meet face on and really tackle and come out better on the other end."
 "As long as it's not something fatal, I'm just fine. I'm happy in life as long as I've got my soul mate with me."
 "You certainly recognize when you're as sick as that and you're in deep trouble, as I was in, what a true partnership means in a marriage."
