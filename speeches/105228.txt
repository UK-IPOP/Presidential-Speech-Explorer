 â€” Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann released a new web video today titled "I Won't Settle," recorded following her Liberty University Convocation Address, in which she highlights her commitment to stand for the conservative principles Americans value most.
"We can have someone who will stand for life and for marriage, stand up for Israel, stand up for national security, stand up for our brave men and women in the military, someone who will stand for strong fiscal policy, who will be committed to repealing Obamacare, who will build the fence on the southern border, who will make sure that we don't have magnets to bring illegal aliens across that border, I will do all of that as Commander in Chief and more," said Bachmann in her latest video.
The following is the full text of the video:
