 certain lands which have been acquired or hereafter may be acquired by the United States through exchanges with the State of Michigan under authority of Title III of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act, approved July 22, 1937 (U.S.C., title 7, secs. 1010, 1012, 50 Stat. 522, 525), are situated within the exterior boundaries of the Huron National Forest, the Manistee National Forest, the Ottawa National Forest, the Marquette National Forest, or the Hiawatha National Forest; and
 it appears that such lands are suitable for national-forest purposes and that it would be in the public interest to reserve such lands as parts of the national forest within which they are situated;
, President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 24 of the act of March 3, 1891, 26 Stat. 1095, 1103, as amended (U.S.C., title 16, sec. 471), and Title III of the said Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act, and as President of the United States, do proclaim that all lands within the exterior boundaries of the Huron, Manistee, Ottawa, Marquette, and Hiawatha National Forests, In the State of Michigan, which have been acquired or hereafter may be acquired by the United States through exchanges with the State of Michigan, under authority of Title III of the said Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act, are hereby reserved, or Immediately upon acceptance of title by the Secretary of Agriculture shall be reserved, as parts of the respective national forests within which they are situated, and shall be subject to all laws, rules, and regulations applicable to national forest lands acquired under the provisions of the act approved March 1, 1911 (36 Stat. 961, U.S.C., title 16, secs. 480, 500, 501, 516, 519-521), and acts amendatory or supplementary thereto.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 29th day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-eighth.
