 â€” Senator Marco Rubio
Dear Marco Rubio,
We would like to provide this donation to help with your campaign. Last night we purchased a copy of your latest book American Dreams. I look forward to sharing it with family and friends. We have been following your public service and look forward to the primaries for the GOP nomination.
My wife Patty is an American Girl, and her mom has been an influence on me as she had to battle several obstacles. Marta came to the USA from El Salvador in the 1950s. All these years she had a Green Card and now four years ago now is a U.S. citizen. Our family is an American success story and want to express our thanks to your efforts to continue American Dreams.
Our thoughts and prayers are with you, and we wish you success in the weeks ahead.
Sincerely,
Chris and Patty
Marco Rubio for President
