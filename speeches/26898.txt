GENERAL agreement has been reached on all the major issues in the trade negotiations. The way is now clear for the conclusion of a final agreement covering billions of dollars worth of trade among more than 50 countries.
Much hard work remains for the weeks ahead. The general understandings reached must be put into concrete form. Thousands of tariffs are involved. The final details must await the completion of this work--and final approval given by governments.
I hope that the final action will meet the standards underlying the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, namely:
--to stimulate economic growth at home;
--to strengthen economic relations with the free world; and
--to reinforce our strength and vitality in the cause of freedom.
