Mr. Chairman:
The ladies and gentlemen gathered at this board are here to greet you as the head of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and to greet Mrs. Khrushcheva, your family and the members of your party. We trust that you will find your trip, your tour, of America both instructive and interesting and enjoyable.
It was a hundred and fifty years ago that diplomatic relations between your country and ours were opened. On November 5, 1809, John Quincy Adams, later Secretary of State, and later President of the United States, presented his credentials to Alexander I. And since that date there has been a history of many incidents of collaboration between your country and mine, and certainly a long history of friendship. In two World Wars we have been allies.
And now today, it seems to me that our two countries have a very special obligation to the entire world. Because of our strength, because of our importance in the world, it is vital that we understand each other better. You and I have agreed on this point.
I think that skillful debate is not now enough. We must depend upon fact and truth. And we must make it our common purpose, as I see it, that we develop for each other the maximum of fact and truth, so that we may better lead--between us--this world into a better opportunity for peace and prosperity.
And it is in that hope, sir, in that effort, in the hope that that effort will be successful, that I ask this company to join me in a Toast to you, Mr. Chairman, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, to Madame Khrushcheva, and to the people of the Soviet Union.
Ladies and gentlemen, Chairman Khrushchev.
