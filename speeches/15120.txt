THE House Judiciary Committee by resolution adopted January 29, 1952, established a special subcommittee to conduct an inquiry of specific allegations and complaints, based upon credible evidence determined by the subcommittee, with reference to the administration of the Department of Justice and the Office of the Attorney General of the United States. It is my desire that the Executive branch of the Government cooperate with the committee to the end that a fair, impartial, and thorough investigation may be made.

Accordingly, I have today issued an Executive Order empowering the committee to inspect tax returns under appropriate limitations, and I now request that all departments and agencies, to the fullest extent consistent with the proper performance of their work and duties, cooperate with Chairman Frank L. Chelf and his subcommittee for the purpose of such an investigation.
