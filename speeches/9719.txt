THE CONFERENCE between the President and the President-elect this morning was attended by Secretaries Stimson and Mills and Messrs. Norman Davis and [Raymond] Moley. The discussions were devoted mainly to a canvass of the foreign situation and the following statement covering the procedure to be followed was agreed upon:
"The British Government has asked for a discussion of the debts. The incoming administration will be glad to receive their representative early in March for this purpose. It is, of course, necessary to discuss at the same time the world economic problems in which the United States and Great Britain are mutually interested, and therefore that representatives should also be sent to discuss ways and means for improving the world situation."
It was settled that these arrangements will be taken up by the Secretary of State with the British Government.
