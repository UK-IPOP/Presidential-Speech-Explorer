Thank you for your thoughtful message regarding the rescue of four Soviet soldiers by the men of the USS Kearsarge.
I am grateful for the happy outcome for these courageous men and am glad that our Navy was in a position to rescue them from the risks and hardships they had undergone.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
