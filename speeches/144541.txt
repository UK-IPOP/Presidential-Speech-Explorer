The Biden-Harris administration is working to rebuild our immigration system after four years of chaos and mismanagement. The trend of border apprehensions in 
 is a reduction of individuals (unique encounters) and families below the peak in 2019. Border numbers fluctuate, however, based on annual migration trends and that is why this administration is working to establish lawful pathways for individuals to migrate or seek protection, address the root causes of migration, restore fair, orderly and humane means to apply for asylum and deter irregular migration. The administration has made significant progress at establishing a well-managed and secure border while also treating people fairly and humanely. The American people support this approach.
