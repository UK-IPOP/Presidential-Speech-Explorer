"I came wondering whether or not cellulosic ethanol was one of these things down the road that may be happening, may not, could end up being science or science fiction. It's going to be science. It's working."
 Thanks to researchers like those at the DuPont Experimental Station, America is on the path to greater energy security. The DuPont Experimental Station was one of the first industrial research and development facilities in the United States. Researchers there are now working on ways to produce cellulosic ethanol from the stalk and leaves that are left in the field after farmers harvest their crop, and the President participated in a tour focusing on this research.
 The Order requires Federal Agencies to lead by example in advancing the Nation's energy security and environmental performance through effective environmental, energy, and transportation management.
 President Bush called on Congress and all Americans to join him in pursuing the goal of reducing U.S. gasoline usage, which will help increase our Nation's energy security by reducing our dependence on oil. Achieving this goal will also help address climate change concerns by potentially stopping the projected growth of carbon dioxide emissions from cars, light trucks, and SUVs within 10 years.
 In 2017, this will displace 15 percent of projected annual gasoline use.
 In 2017, this will reduce projected annual gasoline use by up to 8.5 billion gallons, a further 5 percent reduction that, in combination with increasing the supply of renewable and alternative fuels, will bring the total reduction in projected annual gasoline use to 20 percent.
 The Federal government is the largest purchaser and user of energy in the world. The requirements of the Executive Order will help protect our environment and confront the serious challenge of global climate change.
