I have received today a report from Mayor Richard C. Lee, of New Haven, Conn., on the proceedings of the Urban Affairs Conference held in Pittsburgh on October 10. It is a far-reaching and comprehensive report which examines in detail the vital problems for our cities and suburbs throughout America.
I endorse the report and the program it contains. This program ties in with the 10-year Federal-local action program which I presented in Pittsburgh.
I urge that it be given careful study not only by urban officials but also by all others concerned with the life in our cities.
