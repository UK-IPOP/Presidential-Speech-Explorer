Dear Henry:
I have given careful consideration to your letter of July thirteenth urging that I send to the Senate immediately the nomination of Judge Vinson as Secretary of the Treasury.
I am inclined to agree with you that for the reasons you mention it would be preferable to take this action now instead of waiting for my return from Europe.
I appreciate very much the fine spirit and keen sense of public responsibility in which you have approached this matter.
With personal regards,

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[The Honorable Henry Morgenthau, Jr., The Secretary of the Treasury]
