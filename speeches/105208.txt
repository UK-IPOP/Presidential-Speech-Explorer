AUSTIN — President Obama's socialized medicine plan was dealt a serious blow today by a new Beacon Hill Institute study showing that Governor Mitt Romney's "RomneyCare" plan has cost 18,000 jobs and $8 billion.

"These government-mandated health schemes kill too many jobs and cost too much. RomneyCare's job-killing results are another reason ObamaCare must be stopped."

Additionally, an earlier study by Beacon Hill found that RomneyCare has cost taxpayers nationwide — not just in Massachusetts — nearly $4 billion in higher Medicaid and Medicare expenditures. Private insurance costs in the state have increased by another $4.3 billion. The Institute calculated the cumulative cost of RomneyCare to be $8.569 billion. (3)
