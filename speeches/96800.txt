â€“ President George W. Bush, 2004 State of the Union Address
 The Second Chance Act (H.R. 1593) will help transform lives and build safer communities by helping prisoners who are returning to society break cycles of crime and start new lives. The legislation formally authorizes key elements of the successful Prisoner Reentry Initiative (PRI), announced by the President in 2004, to help prisoners effectively reintegrate into the community. Additionally, the Second Chance Act enhances drug treatment, mentoring, and transitional services for ex-offenders through partnerships with local corrections agencies and faith-based and community organizations.
 
 Expanding upon the successful Ready4Work pilot program, PRI links returning adult nonviolent offenders with faith-based and community organizations that help them find work, connect with mentors, and avoid relapse into criminal activity.
