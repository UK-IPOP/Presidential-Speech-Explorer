Here in Centralia, Ill., I want to throw down a challenge to Senator Kennedy.
I challenge him to come into Illinois, or any oil-producing area, and say exactly what his position is on the current foreign oil imports control programs, originated by the Eisenhower administration.
Does my opponent favor the oil import control program? Specifically, does he favor the part of it which cuts back on the amount of residual fuel oil, produced abroad, which can be imported into this country?
My own position on foreign oil import controls is absolutely clear. I favor the continuation of this program because I believe it is necessary to our national security.
I also challenge Mr. Kennedy to say exactly what his stand is on the oil depletion allowance. And I challenge him to say the same thing in New England as he would say in oil-producing areas.
Again, my own position is perfectly clear. I favor the continuation of the 27Â½-percent oil depletion allowance for our domestic oil producers in the interests of a strong and expanding domestic oil industry which undergirds our national security.
