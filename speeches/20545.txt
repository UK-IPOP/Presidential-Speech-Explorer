Dear Secretary Ribicoff :
I have studied and am in full accord with your recommendations of tangible assistance for Cuban scholars and professional leaders who have temporarily tied their country and are now living here in the United States. Immediate action should be taken on behalf of your proposals, and every possible personal encouragement given to this courageous and remarkable group.
I want to make unmistakably clear that we believe in a free Cuba. The presence in this country of two-thirds of the faculty of the University of Havana, as well as many more educational and professional leaders from the island, attests that an essential part of a free Cuba is now here with us. In community with them, we know that "only the mind cannot be sent into exile."
I will appreciate receiving by July x a report on the progress made in this program and the opportunities it opens up in teaching, medicine, economic development work, and other fields for the benefit of all of the Western Hemisphere.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
