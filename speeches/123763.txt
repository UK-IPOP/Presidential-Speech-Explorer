Well I had the good fortune of hosting 12 of the presidential candidates in a one-on-one forum. And without any question, head and shoulders above the other 11 candidates, was Marco Rubio. When I think about the fact my brother is a Colonel in the Air Force, I think about the guy I want leading this country on day one as commander-in-chief, my answer was simply, Marco Rubio.
Well, Sean, he had such a great night Saturday night. He looked so presidential. He may be the youngest from a chronological standpoint but he sure seemed like an adult Saturday night in Greenville during the debate. He's also got the most popular elected official in the entire state in Tim Scott supporting him and going around the state. I think when people get to meet Marco, we had a fabulous crowd yesterday in Easley. We had a great crowd this morning. When people get to hear him and meet him and ask him questions they wind up supporting him. It's my job and Tim's job to get him in front of as many people throughout the state between now and election day.
