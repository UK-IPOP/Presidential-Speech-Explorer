?Your pooler is at the White House nd has received the COVID test. The test came after a delay due to post election drag that had the wranglers asking, "Where's Hunter?"

A great question. As of now, there is nothing on the president's schedule. We will let you know if that changes. 


?You pooler has checked with staff to see if there are any updates to the president's schedule. There are not. We have not seen any senior officials and there have been no gaggles. Rest assured, you will hear from the pool if that changes. 


Your pooler just checked in with Lower Press to see if they had any updates on plans for the day. They did not.

There is no Marine stationed in front of the West Wing, which indicates the president is not inside the Oval Office. 


?Your pooler still has no updates and there still is no Marine.

As we await further news and results, your pooler would humbly suggest following the Village People's sage advice that we've all heard so much this year. You can get yourself clean. You can have a good meal. You can do whatever you feel. 


?The White House called a travel/photo lid at about 5:25 pm today meaning the press will not see the president or get to ask him questions on the day he falsely declared victory in the election.

Have a good night everybody.
