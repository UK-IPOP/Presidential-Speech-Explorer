"President Obama's trillion-dollar health care legislation was supposed to deliver affordable care for millions of Americans. Instead, Obamacare has delivered skyrocketing costs, failed programs, millions of Americans struggling to obtain insurance, and $716 billion in Medicare cuts that will impact today's seniors. As president, Mitt Romney will immediately repeal this disastrous law and replace it with reforms that empower individuals and free job creators from Obamacare's burdens." – Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 "Confusing language in the health care reform law has raised the possibility that millions of Americans living on modest incomes may be unable to afford their employers' family policies and yet fail to qualify for government subsidies to buy their own insurance. ... The people left in the lurch would be those who had lower incomes but were not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid. They would either have to pay more than they could afford for an employer's family plan or go without health insurance." (Editorial, "A Glitch In Health Care Reform,"

"The Obama administration says it is unable to go forward with a major program in the president's signature health care overhaul law — a new long-term care insurance plan. Officials said Friday the long-term care program has critical design flaws that can't be fixed to make it financially self-sustaining."

 "President Barack Obama's main idea for getting quality health care at less cost was in jeopardy Wednesday after key medical providers called his administration's initial blueprint so complex it's unworkable." (Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar, "Obama Plan For Health Care Quality Dealt A Setback,"

 "The regulations are 'overly prescriptive, operationally burdensome, and the incentives are too difficult to achieve to make this voluntary program attractive,' the medical group association said in its letter. One of the major problems seems to be that medical groups have little experience in managing insurance risk, and the administration blueprint rapidly exposes them to potential financial losses."

 "When the health reform law's high-risk insurance pools launched last summer, there was a lot worry that the new coverage option would be swamped by demand from uninsured individual. Then, there was worry about too little demand: The insurance pools saw anemic enrollment, with some states enrolling just a few dozen subscribers. And now, there's a new worry: The high-risk pools attracted such expensive patients, with costly medical needs, that nearly a quarter are running short on cash."  (Sarah Kliff, "The High Risk Of High-Risk Pools,"

 "In the Office of the Actuary's April 22, 2010 memorandum on the estimated financial effects of the Affordable Care Act, we noted that by 2019 the update reductions would result in negative total facility margins for about 15 percent of hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and home health agencies. This estimated percentage would continue to increase, reaching roughly 25 percent in 2030 and 40 percent by 2050. In practice, providers could not sustain continuing negative margins and, absent legislative changes, would have to withdraw from providing services to Medicare beneficiaries, merge with other provider groups, or shift substantial portions of Medicare costs to their non-Medicare, non-Medicaid payers." ("Projected Expenditures Under An Illustrative Scenario With Alternative Payment Updates To Medicare Providers," Center For Medicare & Medicaid Services, 5/13/11)

 "Currently, about 1 in every 4 Medicare beneficiary is enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan. For many of them, the words in this ad ring hollow, and the promise that 'benefits will remain the same' is just as fictional as the town of Mayberry was when Griffith played the local sheriff."
