BURLINGTON, Vt. â€“ U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders is the best chance Democrats have to retain the White House in November, according to a new 
 national poll.
In a head-to-head matchup with Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, Sanders bests him by 12 points. Hillary Clinton's advantage over Trump is only eight points. Sanders also beats Sen. Marco Rubio by eight points and trounces Sen. Ted Cruz by 17 points, while Secretary Clinton loses to Rubio and Cruz in head-to-head matchups in the CNN/ORC poll.
"This latest poll confirms what other recent polls show. Bernie Sanders is the strongest general election candidate against the Republicans. Secretary Clinton does worse against Trump and actually loses to two of the top three Republican contenders," said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager. "Democrats who want to retain the White House should pull the lever for Bernie Sanders. We cannot risk nominating a candidate who loses to the Republicans before the general election has even begun."
Sanders has the highest favorability of the candidates in the poll, beating Secretary Clinton 57 percent to 42 percent.
