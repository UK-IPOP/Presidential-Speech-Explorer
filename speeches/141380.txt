 in Minneapolis out of jail.

There's a reason law enforcement organizations that once supported Biden are flocking to endorse President Trump. Police officers know President Trump is the only candidate who will truly fight for public safety, defend good police officers, and call out insane Democrat policies that allow rioters to loot and burn unchecked.
