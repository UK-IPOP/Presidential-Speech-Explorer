Last year, well before Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's passing last month, Kamala Harris repeatedly said she was "
" to 
 to the Supreme Court for liberal activist judges â€“ a move straight out of the authoritarian playbook of Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro.

Now that she's Joe Biden's running mate, Harris isn't so honest about her radical views. Last night, when 
 to answer whether a Harris-Biden Administration would pack the Supreme Court, Harris refused to answer the question.



For 17 days now, Biden and Harris have repeatedly refused to answer this simple question about their plan to delegitimize our nation's third branch of government. "Biden and Harris should answer it," 
. "They should've had a better answer than the non-answer [Harris] gave," David Axelrod admitted.

Packing the Supreme Court is massively unpopular, which is why Biden and Harris 
 that's exactly what they plan to do. 


Preserving the credibility of the Supreme Court is not "Trump's game." Stating your position on the demands of Democrat party leaders is not "Trump's game."

Biden and Harris have campaigned on claims they will always telling voters the truth. That's obviously malarkey.
