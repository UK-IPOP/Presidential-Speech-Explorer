"When President Obama chose President Carter for the opening night of his convention, he chose a fitting surrogate. From stagnant unemployment to a broken deficit pledge, both presidents left the country worse off than it was before they took office.  As president, Mitt Romney will deliver a new direction by implementing pro-growth policies that create 12 million new jobs and deliver relief to struggling middle-class families." – Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman
 "The unemployment rate ticked higher to 8.3% in July from 8.2% in the previous month. This is the highest rate since February."(Greg Robb, "Nonfarm Payroll Up 163,000 In July, Rate At 8.3%"

 "It is a matter of great embarrassment to Carter -- and an example of his failed economic policies, his critics say -- that the nation's unemployment rate is now 7.5 percent of the labor force, virtually the same as when he defeated Gerald Ford in 1976, promising he could do much better."

 "The 2013 budget the president submitted today does not come close to meeting this promise of being reduced to $650 billion for fiscal year 2013. The president noted in that 2009 speech the Obama administration inherited a $1.3 trillion deficit. The deficit was similarly $1.3 trillion in 2011, is projected to be $1.15 trillion in 2012, and the president's budget claims it will be $901 billion in 2013." (Jake Tapper, "Obama's Broken Deficit Promise,"

 "Carter failed in his first-term promise to balance the budget by 1981. His administration ended 1980 with a budget deficit of $58.9 billion, the second largest on record, and projects a deficit of $30 billion for 1981. The president has offered no new target for balancing the budget." (R. Gregory Nokes, "Carter, Reagan Have Differing Economic Plans,"

 "As Americans approached Labor Day 1979, the signs of discontent that would devastate the Democrats in 1980 already were clear. The price of gasoline seemed to jump another nickel a gallon every time the family car needed another fill-up. Months of chaos in once-friendly Iran raised the spectre of even higher prices and possibly a return to gasoline lines." (Donald M. Rothberg, "A Presidential Campaign Long In The Making,"
