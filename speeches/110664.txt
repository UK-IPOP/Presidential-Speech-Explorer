"Rick Santorum is trying to label himself a conservative, but his record tells a different story. When it comes to Big Labor, Santorum has been about as conservative as Barack Obama. Labor bosses want to force every worker to pay dues and join a union to hold a job. As a U.S. Senator, Santorum supported their agenda. He even filibustered right to work legislation that would have given every American a chance to hold a job without joining a union. That's not conservatism - it's the liberal program of Big Labor." â€”Greg Hartmann, Hamilton County Commissioner
