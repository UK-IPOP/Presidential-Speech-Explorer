The Administration strongly opposes passage of S. J. Res. 60, a joint resolution to disapprove the Administration's rule on the Expanding Opportunity Through Quality Charter Schools Program.
The Administration is committed to ensuring that all students have access to a high-quality public education. Fulfilling our responsibility to be good stewards of federal funds and support high-quality public charter schools, this past July the Administration issued a rule on the Expanding Opportunity Through Quality Charter Schools Program.
The Administration's requirements for the Expanding Opportunity Through Quality Charter Schools Program, as set out in that rule, ensure that students and families have access to high-quality charter school options that meet the needs of the communities they serve. Specifically, the rule promotes charter school plans, enrollment practices, and academic goals that are well conceived and based in evidence. The rule strengthens fiscal transparency among grantees. The rule also strives to prevent further school segregation and instead supports students from all backgrounds and communities in accessing a high-quality education. The rule reflects these priorities, among others, while providing applicants substantial flexibility in meeting them.
Since the rule was issued, the Department of Education has awarded over $120 million in multi-year grants to create, expand, and replicate high-quality public charter schools, demonstrating that the demand for Expanding Opportunity Through Quality Charter Schools Program funding continues under the rule.
