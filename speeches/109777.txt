"Rick Santorum is right — people are sick and tired of politicians going to Washington and not standing up for their principles. Unfortunately, Senator Santorum has already admitted that he was one of those politicians himself. We need a candidate who can change Washington, not a politician who let Washington change him." —Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 SANTORUM: "How many times have you said you're sick and tired of politicians going to Washington, D.C. and not standing up for their principles? How many times have you said that in the last umpteen years?" (Rick Santorum, Remarks in Milwaukee, WI, 3/24/12)
ANTORUM: "I supported No Child Left Behind. ... I have to admit, I voted for that. It was against the principles I believed in, but, you know, when you're part of the team, sometimes you take one for the team, for the leader, and I made a mistake. You know, politics is a team sport, folks." (GOP Presidential Debate, 2/22/12)
