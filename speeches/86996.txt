 The President calls on Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform to secure our border, improve enforcement of our laws, meet the needs of our economy, and uphold our highest values. The President also discussed his proposal for a temporary worker program that rejects amnesty, allows foreign workers to fill jobs that Americans are not willing to do, and reduces illegal immigration, smuggling, and crime at the border.
 These elements depend on and reinforce one another. Together, they will give America an immigration system that meets 21st century demands.
 Since President Bush took office, funding for border security has increased by 66 percent. The Border Patrol has been expanded to more than 12,000 agents, an increase of more than 2,700 agents, or nearly 30 percent. The President's FY07 budget funds another 1,500 new agents. Agents are being provided with cutting-edge technology like infrared cameras, advanced motion sensors, and unmanned aerial vehicles. Protective infrastructure, such as vehicle barriers and fencing in urban areas, is being installed. Manpower, technology, and infrastructure are being integrated in more coordinated ways than ever before.
 Since President Bush took office, funding for immigration enforcement has increased by 42 percent. These resources have helped agents bring to justice smugglers, terrorists, gang members, and human traffickers. For example, through Operation Community Shield, Federal agents have arrested nearly 2,300 gang members who were in America illegally, including violent criminals like the members of the "MS-13" gang.
 Workers would be able to register for legal status on a temporary basis. If workers decided to apply for citizenship, they would have to get in line. This program would help meet the demands of our growing economy and allow honest workers to provide for their families while respecting the law.
