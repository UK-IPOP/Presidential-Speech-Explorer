As I said, we decided that we want to do find a candidate that really espoused the values that we believed in. Someone who who really had focused their campaign on trying to help — I always talked about the 74 percent of Americans who don't have a college degree, those who are struggling on the margins, the middle of America hollowing out. And understanding the central role of the family and supporting that opportunity. That family breakdown is one of the key reasons that middle is hollowing out. It's not just the lack of opportunities, talk about manufacturing and that important thing.


So thankful & grateful for your support. Just not our year. So today please join me in supporting
