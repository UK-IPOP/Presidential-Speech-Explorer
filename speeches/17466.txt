Dear Justice Sandstrom:

The relief program for the victims of the floods which inundated parts of Central and Eastern Europe last summer is now practically completed. Over $ 10 million worth of aid has been distributed to these unfortunate people, most of it through the active cooperation of your organization.
The most notable fact about this program has been the strict adherence by everyone to the humanitarian principles of the Red Cross. Relief was given to the needy regardless of race, color, creed or political Conviction. For the first time in many years, it was possible to surmount political boundaries in the administration of relief. I know that the success of the program is in a large measure due to the untiring efforts of the members of your organization. Reports received here indicate that Red Cross officials worked long hours, including week ends and holidays, to assure the success of this program. They can be proud of their work.
I wish to express to you and through you to every member of your organization who participated in the successful accomplishment of this undertaking my sincere appreciation, as well as my congratulations.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
