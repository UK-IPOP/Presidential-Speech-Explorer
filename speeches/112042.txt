"President Obama may think the private sector is 'doing fine,' but he can't seem to get his story straight on the public sector. Last Friday, he said the real weakness in the economy was state and local government employment – yet a month earlier, he touted the fact that government employment had fallen on his watch. Americans deserve a president who understands how to grow the economy and has a real plan to get our country back to work." –Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman
 OBAMA: "The private sector is doing fine. Where we're seeing weaknesses in our economy have to do with state and local government -- oftentimes, cuts initiated by governors or mayors who are not getting the kind of help that they have in the past from the federal government..." (President Barack Obama, 
, Washington, DC, 6/8/12)
 OBAMA: "The only time government employment has gone down during a recession has been under me. So I make that point -- I make that point just so you don't buy into this whole bloated government argument that you hear." (President Barack Obama, 
, Albany, NY, 5/8/12)
