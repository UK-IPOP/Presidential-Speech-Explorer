ARLINGTON, VA -- Today, McCain-Palin 2008 campaign spokesman Ben Porritt released the following statement:
"During this year's Democrat primaries, Barack Obama's campaign funneled close to a million dollars to ACORN, and then lied to the Federal Election Commission about the nature of the work. ACORN repaid the favor by enthusiastically endorsing Barack Obama for president, citing his longstanding ties' to the organization. Given ACORN's fraudulent activities, the American people deserve to know the full truth about these ties." 
 
 "U.S. Sen. Barack Obama's presidential campaign paid more than $800,000 to an offshoot of the liberal Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now for services the Democrat's campaign says it mistakenly misrepresented in federal reports. An Obama spokesman said Federal Election Commission reports would be amended to show Citizens Services Inc. -- a subsidiary of ACORN -- worked in get-out-the-vote' projects, instead of activities such as polling, advance work and staging major events as stated in FEC finance reports filed during the primary."
