Defeating Trump requires a consolidated effort. And no states are more important to making that happen than Florida and Ohio. Just ask Marco Rubio.

But for Senator Rubio there's a big problem. 
. The two most recent polls average Trump at 34 percent and Rubio 15 points back. 
There's a much different story going on in Ohio where John Kasich is in a very good position to defeat Trump. 
 Even when all candidates are considered, Kasich is in a statistical tie with Trump — again, a far better position than Rubio can claim in Florida.
