The Clinton campaign today announced it is broadcasting a new television ad in Ohio highlighting Senator Clinton's commitment to standing up for Ohio's working families, reviving Ohio's troubled economy, and delivering new jobs to communities throughout the state. Senator Clinton has a lifetime of experience fighting for the middle class, and as president, she will be a partner to the American worker in the White House.
The 30-second spot, entitled "Partner," comes the day before Ohio voters head to the polls on March 4th.

Hillary For President

"Partner"

TV :30
 I have talked with people from Cincinnati to Dayton to Parma.
 The economy in this part of the state is terrible.
 We need a leader who cares about the people.
 It's time that the American worker had a partner in the White House.
 She's going to bring jobs back here to Ohio.
 And fight for working families here in the United States of America.
 Hillary Clinton can turn this country around.
 The wealthy and the well connected have had a president. It's time the middle class had a president, who will stand up for you.
 I'm Hillary Clinton and I approved this message.
