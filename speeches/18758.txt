I CONGRATULATE Dr. T. Keith Glennan and the members of his Agency, the scientists and engineers, the supporting contractors and military services that contributed so magnificently to this achievement.
Once again, many elements of our scientific, technological and industrial communities have cooperated in the further development of our national program in space exploration under NASA's leadership.
