THE PARTNERSHIP of the Federal Government and the Nation's universities in carrying forward man's quest for knowledge has produced enormous dividends in the past two decades.
It has been an enlightened partnership. It must remain so. Creative research through free inquiry is the working way to new greatness in our society. It can open roads to
--man's mastery of his environment,

--sufficient food, water, and energy to sustain the massed population that is making ours a crowded planet,
--the building of corridors linking the earth to the stars,
--ultimate victory over the tragedy of mental and physical afflictions, and

--progress in helping man live in peace with his neighbor.
So as a Nation we are committed to strengthen and nourish what Vannevar Bush once called "Science, the Endless Frontier."
Federal grants for academic research perform an indispensable role in strengthening science education in our colleges and universities.
I am happy to see that the Congress is acting on my recommendation to remove the statutory restrictions which have restricted us in reimbursing colleges and universities for the indirect costs of doing research under Federal grants. The Congress is acting wisely. The Government and the research community both owe thanks--to the men and women in the Congress who are making this progress possible and to citizens like yourselves who have helped your Government to understand the needs of the academic institutions.
The universities will, under the new legislation, share to some extent in the cost of research projects. We intend to see that this requirement is administered--as I know the Congress meant it to be--in a constructive and reasonable way.
Our hopes demand new excellence in academic science. It must have the talent, the resources, the faith, and the freedom to prosper.
Government's part in meeting this challenge is of critical importance. We will help
--to bring educational opportunities to our gifted young people,
--to build the new facilities that higher education needs,

--to create new centers of excellence, and

--to meet the costs of creative scientific research,
I know that America's colleges and universities, which you gentlemen represent, will continue to help your country in every possible way.
