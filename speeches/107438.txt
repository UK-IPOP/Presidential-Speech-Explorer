WASHINGTON, DC – To honor the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. National Day of Service and Dr. King's life and legacy, the President and Mrs. Obama, the Vice President and Dr. Jill Biden, Cabinet Secretaries, and other senior administration officials participated in community service projects and events throughout the country.

"Today, we celebrate the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. And we should honor that legacy by acting as drum majors for service and lifting up those less fortunate – not just today, but every day," President Obama said. "All of us can find a way to give back to our communities, to gain new skills, and to pull together, even when times are hard. That's what Dr. King believed in, and that's what will make our country stronger."

Today, the First Family participated in a community service project sponsored by the Corporation for National and Community Service in conjunction with Big Brothers Big Sisters and Greater DC Cares at the Browne Education Campus in Washington, DC.
