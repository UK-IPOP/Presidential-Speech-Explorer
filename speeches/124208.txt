I am enthusiastically supporting Marco Rubio because I have personally heard him share how his belief in God impacts the things he believes in and stands for. Our country doesn't need another leader who simply wants to be President for his own personal power and ego, we need a leader like Marco Rubio who uses his gifts and abilities in full submission to an Almighty God.
As a Christian, a Pastor, and a Veteran, I believe Senator Rubio is best qualified to lead our nation for such a time as this.
Marco is honored that Christian leaders throughout the state representing a diverse array of theological traditions believe he is the best choice for president.
