[ Released April 14, 1948. Dated April 9, 1948 ]
My dear Mr. Ambassador:
I have read with pleasure your letter of March twentieth, concerning the proposal of this Government, together with the Governments of the United Kingdom and France, for the return of the Free Territory of Trieste to Italy.
I wish to take this opportunity to express to you again the friendship and good will which the American people feel towards the people of Italy.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[His Excellency Signor Alberto Tarchiani, Ambassador of Italy]
