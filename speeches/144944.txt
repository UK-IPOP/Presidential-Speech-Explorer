Greetings from the White House on a sunny day with a temperature of 91F.
POTUS is due to arrive back from Camp David at 7.30pm.
The White House announced a good weather call for POTUS's return from Camp David. A lunch lid was called until 7pm.
Pool has gathered at The Ellipse for POTUS’s return, now expected just before 8pm.
Marine One touched down at The Ellipse at 7.56pm against the scenic backdrop of the evening moon and Washington Monument.
POTUS, wearing suit and blue shirt and no tie, and carrying a black bag, disembarked Air Force One at 7.58pm. He took off a face mask and waited at the bottom of the steps to help FLOTUS, wearing white.
POTUS then walked back up the steps into the helicopter for a few seconds before returning back down, laughing as he rejoined FLOTUS.
He and FLOTUS walked across the grass and he waved to reporters but did not answer shouted questions. POTUS and FLOTUS waved again before climbing into a limousine that headed to the White House.
A lid was called at 8.05pm.
From the White House press office:
‘Returning with the President and the First Lady from Camp David:
'Annie Tomasini, Director of Oval Office Operations
Anthony Bernal, Advisor to the First Lady
