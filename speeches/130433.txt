"In perhaps his most responsible decision since taking office, President Donald Trump has nominated a well-qualified, conservative federal appeals court judge to the U.S. Supreme Court. Judge Neil Gorsuch is widely praised for his sharp intellect, low-key demeanor and clear writing. ... Gorsuch is a well-qualified conservative who would not tilt the Supreme Court's ideological balance, and he deserves full consideration and a confirmation vote by the Senate."

"But trashing Mr. Gorsuch as an outlandish radical, despite his impeccable credentials, the wide respect he commands in his field, his long service as an appeals court judge and the unanimous voice vote he received the last time the Senate considered him for the federal bench, is at the very least premature." (Editorial, "Gorsuch Deserves A Hearing. These Are The Questions He Should Answer.," 
, 2/1/17)

"Neil Gorsuch is highly principled and deeply experienced, and is poised to become the intellectual leader of conservative jurisprudence. ... Gorsuch is a masterful pick. His resume and background are beyond challenge: Harvard-, Columbia- and Oxford-educated; clerked for two Supreme Court justices; praised for his temperament and reverence for the law; more than a decade of experience on the federal bench. He is a legal superstar and Democrats know it." (Editorial, "Trump's Pick Is Masterful," 
, 2/1/17)

"The bad news, Democrats, is that President Donald Trump has selected a qualified and thoughtful jurist to fill the Supreme Court seat that coulda woulda shoulda gone to another fine mind and fine man, Merrick Garland." (Editorial, "In Neil Gorsuch, Trump Has Selected A Qualified And Conservative Jurist," 
, 2/1/17)

 
"Colorado Judge Neil Gorsuch is an excellent choice to fill the vacant seat on the U.S. Supreme Court, and fulfills President Donald Trump's campaign promise to pick a worthy successor to Justice Antonin Scalia. ... Neil Gorsuch would be a stellar addition to the court, and we endorse his confirmation." (Editorial, "Justice For All: Gorsuch Is An Outstanding Choice,"

"[Gorsuch] is a traditional pick, lauded by liberals and conservatives alike as a brilliant legal mind in the mold of Scalia (only the conservatives like that last part, of course). He boasts a flawless resume. He is praised for his temperament and clear writing. He deserves fair consideration and speedy confirmation." (Editorial, "Confirm Gorsuch,"

"Gorsuch is plainly an able and thoughtful jurist, a skilled and incisive legal writer. ... Above all, Gorsuch is simply, undeniably, a legitimate and respectable nominee." (Editorial, "Gorsuch Deserves Better Treatment Than Garland Got,"

"Gorsuch has a stellar resume, and at least he will get the courtesy of a Senate hearing to explain his theory of original intent when interpreting the Constitution." (Editorial, "Resist Revenge For GOP Blockage Of Merrick Garland,"

"In nominating Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court, President Trump selected exactly the sort of person his supporters were hoping for when they cast their ballots in November — a solid conservative with great legal credentials and a profound respect for the Constitution. Gorsuch's confirmation should be a slam dunk, but of course he will have to survive a ferocious opposition campaign by Democrats and progressive groups." (Editorial, "Trump Fulfills Promise With Selection Of Gorsuch To Fill SCOTUS Vacancy," 
, 2/2/17)

"From the evidence so far, Neil Gorsuch has the qualities anyone considered for justice of the highest court should have: a strong understanding and respect for the nation's founding document, the U.S. Constitution. ... Congratulations to President Trump on a quality pick for Supreme Court justice..." (Editorial, "Neil Gorsuch A Great Pick For Supreme Court,"

"His integrity is absolute; his disposition appropriate for the job. ... Our initial reaction to Gorsuch's nomination was to cheer. ... The Times-Dispatch believes Neil Gorsuch would be a valuable addition to a Supreme Court whose motto proclaims ‘Equal justice under law.'" (Editorial, "Colorado Sets Precedent For Gorsuch Stampede,"

"From what's been reported, Trump's nominee, Neil Gorsuch, appears to be highly qualified and deserving of an up-or-down vote after intensive vetting. ... Gorsuch certainly has excellent qualifications and appears to be a distinguished choice." (Editorial, "Angry Democrats Should Give Gorsuch Proper Hearing," 
, 2/1/17)

"Judge Neil Gorsuch, of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit (based in Denver and serving six Western states from Kansas to New Mexico), is a stellar choice for the Supreme Court." (Editorial, "Committed To The Law," 
, 2/2/17)

"By any reasonable legal standard, Gorsuch's work history makes him eminently qualified to serve on the Supreme Court. ... Just like Obama nominees Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagen before him, Gorsuch's legal qualifications are excellent." (Editorial, "Reject Gridlock, Give Gorsuch A Fair And Robust Hearing," 
, 2/1/17)

"So it was with at least a modicum of relief that we learned the man the new president has nominated to succeed the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is not a renegade neophyte contemptuous of those who have come before him, but a seasoned appellate judge respected by peers across the ideological spectrum. ... But Gorsuch's sterling resume does little to reassure liberals who see him as a more youthful, less acerbic, but equally determined champion for the originalist judicial outlook that Scalia personified." (Editorial, "Neil Gorsuch, A Shrewd Choice For A Stolen Supreme Court Seat," 
, 2/1/17)

"Based on [Gorsuch's] resume — Columbia undergrad, Harvard Law School, Oxford as a Marshall Scholar, two Supreme Court clerkships and experience handling a variety of cases on a federal appellate court — qualifications shouldn't be an issue. On the temperament front, he has a strong reputation as a collegial and modest jurist who works well with those across the ideological spectrum." (Editorial, "Gorsuch Deserves A Fair Shake," 
, 2/1/17)

"Amid the insane swirl of action and immediate reaction of his first 12 days, Donald Trump has made a well-considered selection for the next justice of the Supreme Court. ... Judge Gorsuch is more than qualified in education, experience, judicial record and temperament." (Editorial, "Gorsuch Well Qualified To Take Scalia's Seat,"
