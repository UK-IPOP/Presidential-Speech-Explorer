The Romney for President Campaign today announced the formation of New Hampshire Women For Mitt. The group of over 250 women will be chaired by Kathy Gregg (Rye), Nancy Sununu (Hampton Falls), Lisa Bass (Peterborough), Hillsborough County Commissioner Carol Holden (Amherst), Former State Senator Sheila Roberge (Bedford), Former State Representative Stella Scamman (Stratham), Former State Representative Maureen Mooney (Merrimack), Sharon Sykas (Stratham), Jan Glassman (Center Barnstead) and Juliana Bergeron (Keene).
"I am proud to earn the support of these outstanding women from across New Hampshire," said Mitt Romney. "They share my vision of a â€˜Smaller, Simpler, and Smarter' federal government so that we don't burden future generations with crushing debt and deficits. Their help will be necessary to spread my message of conservative economic principles to voters both in the Granite State and the rest of the country."
Announcing her support, New Hampshire Women for Mitt Co-Chair Juliana Bergeron said, "Governor Romney is head and shoulders above the rest of the Republican field and clearly the strongest candidate to take on President Obama. He has spent his life as a conservative businessman and has the values, integrity, and stability to lead our country. Mitt knows how our economy works and how to put Americans back to work. We are proud to support his campaign and will work tirelessly to elect him as the next President of the United States."
