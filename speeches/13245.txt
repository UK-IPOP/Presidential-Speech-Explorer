My dear Mr. Secretary:
I have today issued the attached proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe the week of October 5--11, 1947, as National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week. In that proclamation I asked the heads of all government agencies to make every effort to enlist public support for a sustained program aimed at the employment and full use of the capacities of physically handicapped workers.
Because of your responsibilities in the Federal Government's contribution to the efficient employment of the Nation's working force, I am relying upon you to take a vigorous part in the observance of National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week. You may wish to consult with the Federal Security Administrator and the Administrator of Veterans Affairs who are also especially concerned with the effectiveness of this campaign.

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[The Honorable The Secretary of Labor, Washington, D.C.]
