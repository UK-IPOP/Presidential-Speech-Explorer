[Released January 13, 1956. Dated January 11, 1956]
Dear Mr. Dulles:
In the Hoover Commission Report submitted to Congress on June 29, 1955, relating to the intelligence activities of the Government, there is a recommendation that I appoint a "committee of experienced private citizens who shall have the responsibility to examine and report" on the work of the Government's foreign intelligence activities. I have noted your concurrence.
In accordance with this recommendation, I am constituting a Board of Consultants to review periodically the foreign intelligence activities of this Government, and to report their findings' to me. While the review would concern itself with the sum total of these activities, it would be expected that major attention would be concentrated upon the work of the Central Intelligence Agency. A copy of the letter which I am sending to the prospective members of the Board is enclosed.
The work of this Board together with the regular reviews conducted by the appropriate Committees of the Congress will help to provide a method for assuring the Congress, the public, and the Executive Branch that this highly important and sensitive work is being efficiently conducted.
I know that you will afford the Board of Consultants the fullest cooperation in its work.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
