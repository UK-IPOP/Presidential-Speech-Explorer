THE Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry is beginning this morning to hold hearings on Palestine and the European Jews.
The President is glad to note that the Committee has started its proceedings so promptly. It is to be hoped that the Committee will be able successfully to complete its examination of the various matters contained in its terms of reference.
The fact that the British Members of the Committee have agreed that the inquiry should begin in Washington is also particularly welcome as evidence of the spirit of cooperation which the President is confident will characterize all the operations of the Committee.
