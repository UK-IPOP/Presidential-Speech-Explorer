 Mrs. Reagan, hi, how are you today?
 [

 Good, thank you. Listen, I'm honored. I'm here in the Oval Office——
 [

 Well, thank you. And I'm getting ready to sign a birthday card to the President, my first document I'll sign as the President, which is a joint resolution from the Congress——
 Oh, how nice.
 ——which expresses our deep gratitude and admiration for President Reagan.
 How nice.
 We honor him with his greatness and his goodness. And we honor you, as well, for your strength of character and your service.
So I'm getting ready to sign right now——
 Oh, this is very exciting.
 Well, thank you, ma'am. It's exciting for me, as well. It's an honor. And I look forward to sending the document and the pen that I use to you.
 Oh, how nice. How nice.
 At any rate, it's great to talk to you.
 Well, it's great to talk to you, too. And I can't thank you enough.
 Well, thanks a lot.
 It's wonderful. Wait until I tell Ronnie.
 Give the President a hug and a kiss.
 I will.
 Thanks a lot.
 Thank you.
 Bye-bye.
