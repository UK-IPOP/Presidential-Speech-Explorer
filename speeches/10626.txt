My dear Mr. Curtis:
I have received your telegram and do feel gratification that the United Campaign Appeal of Philadelphia has been oversubscribed. I wish most heartily to congratulate you and your colleagues and the people of Philadelphia on the fine spirit shown.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
