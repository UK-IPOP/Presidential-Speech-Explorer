 Today, Governor Mitt Romney named the South Carolina members of the Young Professionals for Mitt Coalition. Governor Romney's youngest son, Craig, and Craig's wife, Mary, held a Young Professionals for Mitt event in Columbia this morning and will hold an event at Charleston Southern University later today to kick off the coalition.
This week, Craig, Mary, and their son Parker are driving the Mitt Mobile across the Palmetto State to highlight South Carolina Youth for Mitt. The Romney family continued the seven day South Carolina Mitt Mobile tour yesterday in the Chapin Labor Day Parade and will make stops across the state through Thursday.
Announcing the coalition, Governor Romney said, "I am very pleased to be able to announce these young South Carolina leaders. These leaders are the next generation of innovators, entrepreneurs, and business leaders that will drive America's economic growth through the 21st century, and I am proud to welcome them to the team."
