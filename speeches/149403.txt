Good morning. I will be your in town pooler today. Call time is not until noon. But in the meantime, the White House passes this along:
Last night, the President made congratulatory calls from Air Force One to Representative Katie Porter at 11:43 PM EST and Representative Karen Bass at 11:54 PM EST.
Just hours after POTUS returned from overseas, the White House has kindly called a lid for the day.
Enjoy the blustery weather.
