His Excellency

Marshal Josip Broz-Tito

President of the Federal Peoples Republic of Yugoslavia
Permit me on behalf of the American people personally to extend my warm congratulations to you and to the other members of your government at the achievement of an agreement on the Trieste problem. This agreement, worked out with good will, patience and unremitting endeavor, reflects honor upon your government, for the broad, farsighted statesmanship which has made this agreement possible.
I am sure that you share with me the sense of optimism engendered by the agreement. All of the peoples of the free nations of Europe, as well as the American people, will now be encouraged by this arrangement which opens the way to greater security in Southeastern Europe against any possible encroachment and fosters the hope that improved relations between Yugoslavia and Italy will enhance the general welfare and peace in Europe.
I wish to convey to you my deep gratification at this accord which I am convinced will materially contribute to that which is closest to our hearts, the maintenance of peace, of security and of prosperity in the world.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
