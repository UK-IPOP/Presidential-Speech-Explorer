Your Majesty:
It is with sincere pleasure that I take the occasion of the visit of the Vice President of the United States to your country to send you this letter of personal greetings.
I know that your nation, soon to celebrate the first anniversary of its independence, shares the desire of the entire Free World for international peace and justice and works actively to fulfill the role which has fallen to it as a member of the family of nations. I am also aware that you and your government are dedicated to the furtherance of the welfare of your people.
I am therefore especially pleased that the Vice President is able to see Tunisia at first hand and to talk with you and the members of your government concerning your nation's policies and problems. I look forward to his return to the United States and his personal report to me of his visit.
I extend to you my best wishes for your continued health and happiness,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
