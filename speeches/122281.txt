Two well-known Maryland Republican officials will oversee Marco Rubio's presidential bid in the state, the Florida senator's campaign said Monday.

Del. Christian J. Miele of Baltimore County, and former Anne Arundel County Executive Laura Neuman, will serve as co-chairs of Rubio's effort in the state. Ruibo is the first GOP candidate to announce a leadership team in Maryland.
