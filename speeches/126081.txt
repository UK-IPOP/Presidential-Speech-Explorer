"If you don't want Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton to win, then John Kasich is your only choice. Ted Cruz can't win the nomination outright and he can't defeat Hillary Clinton either. John Kasich will win the Convention and he will defeat Hillary Clinton in November. John Kasich is the only candidate who can unite the Party and win the White House." â€” Trent Duffy, Kasich for America National Spokesman
