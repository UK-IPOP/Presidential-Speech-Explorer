Florida Veterans Are Backing Marco

 




Marco Rubio fought for veterans in the United States Senate and will do the same in the White House. Donald Trump, a man who dodged the draft by claiming 'bone spurs' prevented him from serving, has repeatedly denigrated the service of heroes like Colonel Leo Thorsness, POW and Medal of Honor recipient, who was among the many POWs Trump slurred when he said he 'like[s] the ones who weren't captured,' and called them losers.

Trump does not care about veterans unless there is something in it for him. Marco Rubio worked across the aisle to bring more accountability to the Veterans Administration. Most importantly, Marco understands the threats America faces around the world and has the proven judgment required to be Commander-in-Chief. We urge all our fellow Florida veterans to reject Donald Trump and vote for Marco Rubio for President.
