We have a lunch lid until 5:30 p.m.
The White House passes this on:
In honor of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, the north fa√ßade of the White House will be illuminated in pink on Friday, October 1 from 12:01 AM through 8:00 AM, and again from sunset through 11:00 PM.
Thus ends a scintillating, dramatic, stimulating, compelling, exhilarating, arresting, bracing, rousing pool evening filled with the always present and intoxicating hope of seeing the president, a promise that sadly still was unrequited by the time a lid was declared at 10:57 p.m.
Good night.
