AS A RESULT of the publicity amendment and the attitude of insistence of the House upon its position, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation met late yesterday and advised the President of the damage that would result to the financial credit structure of this country if this amendment were insisted upon. By reason of that fact, the President felt impelled to call the available conferees on the bill into conference where an opportunity could be afforded for the Reconstruction Finance Corporation Board and the only available Senate conferees to meet and hear what they had to say.
All present frankly stated their views as to what would be the specific results and outcome if this publicity amendment were insisted upon. President Hoover stated to the conference his policy was and had been to give the fullest publicity to all governmental activities, but that he wished the Congress to be fully and absolutely apprised in view of the urgency of the emergency situation and of the unique relations of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation with building and loan associations, insurance companies, banks, and other financial institutions generally and of the consequent responsibility that lay upon Congress in the considering of the unanimous views of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation Board and what they had to say about the situation.
Having made it possible for the Board to acquaint these Members with its views, then the responsibility, in the final analysis, for whatever might happen must necessarily rest upon Congress.
