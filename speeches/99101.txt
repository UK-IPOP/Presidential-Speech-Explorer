 The status quo in Afghanistan is unacceptable, and from the moment the next President walks into the Oval Office, he will face critical decisions about Afghanistan.
 As President, John McCain will turn around the war in Afghanistan with a comprehensive strategy for victory.
 One of the reasons there is no comprehensive campaign plan for Afghanistan is because there is no unity of command. Today, there are no less than three different American military combatant commands operating in Afghanistan, as well as NATO. The top commander in Afghanistan needs to be just that: the supreme commander of all coalition forces operating a successful counter-insurgency strategy that integrates all instructs of our national power.
 Unity of command is a principle lacking in Washington. Too often, even as our soldiers and diplomats cooperate in the field, their superiors back home have been squabbling. Last year, the Administration took a step in the right direction and appointed a war czar. But the situation in Afghanistan demands a separate Czar based in the White House, reporting directly to the President and dedicated to the sole mission of ensuring we bring the war in Afghanistan to a successful end. 
 We must strengthen local tribes in the border areas who are willing to fight the foreign terrorists there. We must also empower the new civilian government of Pakistan to defeat radicalism with greater support for development, health, and education.
