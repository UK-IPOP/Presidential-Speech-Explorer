 by proclamation of January 27, 1931 (46 Stat. 3044), there were set apart and reserved as the Ottawa National Forest in the State of Michigan certain lands which had been, or might thereafter be, acquired by the United States of America under authority of the act of Congress approved March 1, 1911, ch. 186, 36 Stat. 961 (U.S.C., title 16, sec. 516), as amended by the act of June 7, 1924, ch. 348, 43 Stat. 653 (U.S.C., title 16, sec. 515), together with certain adjoining public lands; and
 it appears that it would be in the public interest to modify the boundaries of the said national forest by including therein certain other forest lands which have been, or may be, acquired under authority of the said acts of March 1, 1911, and June 7, 1924, and the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935, approved April 8, 1935 (49 Stat. 115), and certain adjoining public lands:
, President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the power in me vested by section 24 of the act of March 3, 1891, ch. 561, 26 Stat. 1095. 1103, as amended (U.S.C., title 16, sec. 471), the act of June 4, 1897, ch. 2, 30 Stat. 34, 36 (U.S.C., title 16, sec. 473), section 11 of the said act of March 1, 1911, ch. 186, 36 Stat. 963 (U.S.C., title 16, sec. 521), and section 5 of the said Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935 do proclaim that all lands of the United States within the areas shown as additions on the diagram attached hereto and made a part hereof are hereby included in and reserved as a part of the Ottawa National Forest, and that all lands within such areas which may here after be acquired by the United States under the said acts of March 1, 1911, and June 7, 1924, and the said Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935 shall upon acquisition of title thereto be reserved and administered as a part of the said Forest.
The reservation made by this proclamation shall as to all lands which are at this date legally appropriated under the public-land laws or reserved for any public purpose other than for classification under Executive Orders No. 4430 of April 23, 1926, as modified, and No. 6964 of February 5, 1935, as amended, be subject to, and shall not interfere with or defeat, legal rights under such appropriation, or prevent the use for such public purpose of lands so reserved, so long as such appropriation is legally maintained or such reservation remains in force.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 11th day of January in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-seven and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-first.
