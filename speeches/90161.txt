 â€“ In advance of tomorrow's Republican presidential debate, Senator John Edwards has submitted a question to the Politico that he hopes will be asked of the Republican candidates at the debate. Edwards wants to hear from the candidates about whether they believe the Bush doctrine of a "Global War on Terror" has backfired.
"I believe our experience has proven that the exercise of raw power alone does not make you a world leader, and will not make us secure," said Edwards. "Our capacity to lead requires that we be strong - and that we have the moral authority to do it."
Edwards submitted the following question for the debate:
"Has the Bush doctrine of a Global War on Terror backfired? Does the president's focus suggest a fixed enemy that can be defeated through a permanent military campaign or do you think we need a broader approach as many military leaders believe?"
