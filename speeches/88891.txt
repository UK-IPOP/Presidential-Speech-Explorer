 A new Mississippi is emerging from Katrina's destruction, evidenced by the new partnership between local communities, the State government, and the Federal government; the reconstruction of Mississippi's homes and businesses; the support Mississippi is providing for students; and the armies of compassion that have risen up in every Gulf Coast community. However, the one-year anniversary is not the finish line, and many challenges still remain.
 The President believes the people of Mississippi know the needs of their communities better than people in Washington. Their vision is the future of the Gulf Coast, and the Federal government will do its part to help them achieve that vision. Over the past 12 months, this partnership has yielded results:
 In Mississippi, more than $3 billion in housing grants is beginning to flow into the hands of homeowners and renters to help them repair, rebuild, and relocate. The rebuilding effort will require help from everyone - government agencies, insurance companies, volunteers, and others.
 Education is the gateway to opportunity in life and the future of Mississippi and our Nation. The President is committed to building an education system that gives every child the tools to succeed.
 For example, volunteers at Hands-On Gulf Coast are cleaning up wreckage, removing mold, repairing roofs, providing food and clothing, and tutoring students.
 This giving has been used by America's armies of compassion to provide much-needed services to hurricane victims.
