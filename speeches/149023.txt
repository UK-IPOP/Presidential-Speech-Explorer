Additional quote from remarks:
"I've seen you turn pain into purpose," Biden said to the packed church of the families present at the vigil. "Together we've made some important progress. The most significant gun law passed in 30 and still not enough."
"A lot of peoples lives were saved," Biden said recalling legislation passed in the 90's, also under Speaker Nancy Pelosi, on gun regulations. "You know we can do it again."
We have a lid.
