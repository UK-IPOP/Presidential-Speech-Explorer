Marco Rubio is the Republican presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Democrats are most scared to run against because his energy, enthusiasm and positive conservative vision for a stronger America contrasts with the Democrats tired, old ideas.
"With Marco Rubio, we are getting an unabashed conservative that can win a general election and find new solutions to the lingering challenges facing our country.
Marco has the ability to unite and expand our party, and also will be able to defeat whomever the Democrats nominate this fall. I'm proud to throw my support behind his candidacy and will be working hard for him in Arkansas and across the country on issues like our debt crisis where we face over $19 trillion in debt and growing.
