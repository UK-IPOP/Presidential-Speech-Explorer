"I'm pleased to hear that the Government Accountability Office has found what we have been hearing from people across the country: overall Recovery Act programs and projects are working effectively to create jobs and drive economic growth.  As GAO notes, Recovery Act investments have been critical for preventing massive budget cuts to programs like education and Medicaid, and because we're delivering on-time – and in many cases under-budget – on Recovery Act projects, we've been able to get maximum bang for the employment buck on our infrastructure investments."

"Both public and private forecasters now say the Recovery Act is already responsible for about 2 million jobs, so it's clear that our work over the last year is delivering results.  Because the Recovery Act is an unprecedented program, we are constantly looking for ways to improve its implementation and appreciate some of the new recommendations GAO has made today.  As we have with previous reports, we have asked agencies to look at how they can act on the new guidance to sharpen management of the program even further."

"One year in, there is growing consensus that the Recovery Act has worked to pull us back from the brink of economic disaster and lay a foundation for recovery – we're pleased to hear today that GAO agrees."
