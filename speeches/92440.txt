 "And the ultimate thing is, I may not be the expert that some people are on foreign policy, but I did stay in a Holiday Inn Express last night." ("Imus In The Morning," 12/4/07)
 "In sum, conservatives should have worries about the depth and soundness of Mike Huckabee's foreign-policy views. And staying at a Holiday Inn Express is not going to be enough to allay them." (Editorial, "The Holiday Inn Express Candidate,

 NBC's TIM RUSSERT: "Mike Huckabee said that the George Bush presidency's foreign policy is arrogant and a bunker mentality." GOV. MITT ROMNEY: "That's an insult to the President and Mike Huckabee should apologize to the President. ... But it's very different to point out the mistakes that have been made – and the President's pointed out the mistakes as well – and then to say that the Bush Administration, our President, is 'arrogant' with a 'bunker mentality,' that's a completely different statement for which Mike Huckabee owes the President an apology." (NBC's "Meet The Press," 12/16/07)


 GOV. ROMNEY: "To accuse the president of an arrogant, bunker mentality is in my view more fitting of a person running for the Democratic Party than from our own. It sounds like something Barack Obama or John Edwards would say, not what you hear from someone running for President as a Republican. And I think it was a very serious error."

 "On Sunday, former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, who is remaining neutral in the GOP primary race, called Huckabee's 
 comments 'unwarranted and unwise.' 'There is much to like about Mike Huckabee. But he will serve Republican primary voters, and our nation, better if he focused his criticisms on the Democrats who will run against our eventual nominee and not on the President who has kept us safe,' said Fleischer."

 FOX NEWS' BRIGITTE QUINN: "Do you score points, Bill, with the Republican faithful by going after the President like that?" BILL SAMMON: "No, I think you talk about counterproductive. I think this is going to be counterproductive to Huckabee's chances in the primaries. I mean, it makes him sound like a democrat, which is not a good thing if you're trying to appeal to voters in a Republican primary." (Fox News' "Live," 12/15/07; 
 SAMMON: "For Huckabee to just launch a full frontal assault, shows that he might not have the sort of deft touch that you need on foreign policy. Remember, conservatives are already a little bit worried about Huckabee on taxes, on spending and maybe on ethics and what Huckabee doesn't need at this time is to have them worry about him on foreign policy as well." (Fox News' "Live," 12/15/07; 
 SAMMON: "I went back and looked at some quotes that the Democrats said and it really looks like a page ripped out of the Democratic play book. So what he's doing at the very least is giving political aid and comfort to the opposition party, namely the Democrats, because you know the Democrats are going to jump on this and say, 'see, we told you Bush's policy was all wrong and even the leading front running presidential candidate says so.' So I think he overreached a little bit on this one." (Fox News' "Live," 12/15/07; 
 QUINN: "I mean he really goes after the President also on Tora Bora saying we played Brer Fox to his Brer Rabbit talking about Osama Bin Laden. You know we threw Osama into the perfect briar patch, accusing the President of letting him get away. And I have got say Bill, not to criticize Huckabee,

 "By using the word 'clueless,' I refer not only to Michael D. Huckabee's understanding of international relations as outlined in his Foreign Affairs essay, but the 1995 Alicia Silverstone teen movie, which seems a surprisingly relevant comparison, given Huckabee's opening paragraph:" (Philip Klein, "Huckabee's 'Clueless' Foreign Policy,"

 "More than anything, Huckabee's essay is startling in its incoherence, and it has something within it to scare off any faction of the conservative movement. To those who remain supportive of President Bush and believe he has helped keep us safe since Sept. 11, Huckabee writes that 'the Bush administration's arrogant bunker mentality has been counterproductive at home and abroad.'"

 "He goes on to echo liberal talking points in criticizing Bush for his handling of Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, and Al Qaeda. For those conservatives who believe that Iran does not deserve to be awarded with diplomatic ties to the U.S. given its 'a world without America' and 'wipe Israel off the map' rhetoric - not to mention funding of terrorist activities directed at Americans in Iraq - Huckabee thinks we should talk with the Islamist government, because 'When one stops talking to a parent or a friend, differences cannot be resolved and relationships cannot move forward. The same is true for countries.'" (Philip Klein, "Huckabee's 'Clueless' Foreign Policy,"

 "I'm sure there are some non-interventionist conservatives who may agree with Huckabee's criticisms of the Bush administration for being overly macho, and needlessly confrontational with Iran. Yet what they have to look forward to in a Huckabee administration would be continued U.S. presence in Iraq, possible air strikes on Pakistan, a larger military, and a foreign aid program that would make Lyndon Johnson's Great Society look like a trivial domestic initiative."

 "However, the essence of his overview seems to emphasize his departure from George Bush while maintaining most of his policies. He talks about engaging Iran with more diplomatic options, but then says he supports Bush's sanctions against Iran as a path to denuclearization. Huckabee doesn't credit Bush with the efforts made over the last four years to allow for any number of diplomatic options, including WTO membership and normalized relations through the EU-3 negotiations.

 "Mike Huckabee has written an article about foreign policy for the magazine Foreign Affairs. Much of the piece is what one would expect from a presidential candidate's foreign policy ruminations – a little bit of this, a little bit of that, not too hot, not too cold. But the opening two paragraphs reveal once again how Carteresque Huckabee's foreign policy instincts are." (Paul Mirengoff, "More Mush From The Huck,"

 "Note how Huckabee again anthropomorphizes foreign policy. Previously, enemies like Iran have starred in the Huckabee foreign policy narrative as a misguided family member to whom we have petulantly refused to speak. Now the U.S. is portrayed as an immodest high school student who may be to blame for his own unpopularity. Put aside Huckabee's flirtation with 'blame American first' thinking; the superficiality with which he approaches world affairs is stunning." (Paul Mirengoff, "More Mush From The Huck,"

 "Huckabee's analogy of the U.S. to the arrogant school boy is not just sophomoric, it's affirmatively inapt. Huckabee provides no evidence that the Bush administration has an 'arrogant bunker mentality,' and his invocation of this phrase suggests that his foreign policy views have been formed more by watching CNN in airports, than by watching the Bush administration in action."

 "But debating the merits of foreign policy doesn't seem to be Huckabee's thing. He prefers homey analogies, often snatched (or so it seems) from Democratic talking points. The world is too dangerous a place for such soft thinking." (Paul Mirengoff, "More Mush From The Huck,"

 "If you can read this and not feel majorly concerned about this man controlling America's wartime foreign policy, then (a) you're probably in the wrong party to be supporting him anyway, or (b) chances are you're as clueless on these matters as Huck is (and therefore similarly unfit to be President). Seriously, this isn't a personal attack -- it's an observation just how scarily ignorant this candidate appears to be." (Jeff Emanuel, "Speaking Of Huck And Foreign Affairs,"

 "Today's Huckabee headlines concern an article, 'America's Priorities in the War on Terror,' that Huckabee has written in Foreign Affairs. Only guys named Mike Huckabee don't write such articles, so in this case the author is 'Michael D. Huckabee.' (The 'D' stands for Dale.) The article begins with this rather dreadful paragraph: 'The United States, as the world's only superpower, is less vulnerable to military defeat. But it is more vulnerable to the animosity of other countries. Much like a top high school student, if it is modest about its abilities and achievements, if it is generous in helping others, it is loved. But if it attempts to dominate others, it is despised.' Less vulnerable than what? More vulnerable than what? Would anyone deny that in many, many ways the U.S. government is extraordinarily generous in world affairs?" (Byron York, "Micahel D.

 "But what he offers inter alia is the rehashed plan of invading the nuclear, nominal ally Pakistan ('I prefer to cut to the chase by going after al Qaeda's safe havens in Pakistan.') while reaching out to Iran, the de facto non-nuclear enemy, by offering normal diplomatic relations - of course, only after strengthening sanctions and declaring the Revolutionary Guards terrorists. He laments losing the good will once shown by Iran in its 2001 shared goal of defeating the Taliban-almost like lamenting the needless estrangement of the Soviet Union in 1946 after we once had been so close in working to defeat Hitler."

 "If Huckabee were to win the White House, the Republican Party would not be the only thing in serious trouble, but the country would as well. Huckabee criticizes the Bush Administration for what he refers to as their 'bunker mentality,' but his lack of understanding the threats to the national security of the United States could cause even more setbacks."

 "It's just not realistic, and the fact that he's in contention for the presidency makes it dangerous. Does Huckabee seriously believe that Iran will be content in their current position? Does Huckabee believe that the United States can negotiate with Ahmadinejad? Isn't the Iranian government the same one that swears to 'wipe Israel off the map' and to continue to argue the Holocaust-as-myth propaganda? Is the United States' relationship with Iran really akin to that of a relationship of siblings, friends, or parental guidance? Huckabee's solutions lie in communication and leading by example, where in his world, if we behave like gentlemen, then the rest of the world will love us..."

 "Huckabee's foreign policy ideas seem to have been lifted straight from an imaginary Joe Biden cabinet. He was apparently serious when he said that he believed his 'theology degree' uniquely qualifies him to understand the enemies mindset.

 "This is an extremely naive viewpoint. Do many Americans not understand that jihadists want to harm us? Does Huckabee really believe that he can convince those on the far left who haven't already figured this out? While Huckabee criticizes Bush's communication, he seems to buy into the idea that the world is run by 'good guys and bad guys,' which is exactly the Bush mindset.

 "The essay is a great symbol of Huckabee's campaign -- there are feints in interesting directions, but in the end it's just a grab-bag of contradictory ideas. In a 
 profile, Huckabee mentions columnist Thomas Friedman and new sovereigntist Frank Gaffney as his foreign policy influences. Those in the know might believe this to be impossible, but Huckabee's Foreign Affairs essay really is an attempt to mix these two together in some kind of unholy alchemy." (Daniel W. Drezner, "Every Time I Think I'm Out, Foreign Affairs Pulls Me Back In,"

 "Really, you just have to stand back and marvel at the contradiction of sentiments contained in that paragraph. It's endemic to the entire essay -- for someone who claims he wants to get rid of the bunker mentality, Huckabee offers no concrete ideas for how to do that, and a lot of policies (rejecting the Law of the Sea Treaty, using force in Pakistan, boosting defense spending by 50%) that will ensure anti-Americanism for years to come. Then there's the writing -- dear Lord, the writing. Huckabee's essay reads like it was written by people who couldn't hack it in Rudy Giuliani's crack speechwriting team." (Daniel W.
