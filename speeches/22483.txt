MR. PRESIDENT, Mrs. Johnson and I are delighted to welcome you, Madame Segni, your distinguished Foreign Minister, Mr. Saragat, and other members of your party to the United States.
You, Mr. President, are no stranger to this country. indeed, we are not strangers to each other. The United States has had the honor of welcoming you before as a leading Italian statesman who served with distinction as the Italian Republic's Premier and Foreign Minister.
Personally, I will never forget the warm hospitality that we received on my visit to Rome in the fall of 1962 and then again last summer when I attended the funeral of Pope John.
Our ties with the Italian people go back several centuries--to the discovery of America itself. The close association of our governments and our peoples is an important political fact of life in this half of the 20th century. There are living today in our country millions of citizens whose blood is Italian and whose contribution to the building of this Nation has been large.
Together, our governments and our peoples share many common interests not only in fighting poverty but in improving the lot of ordinary men and women everywhere.
So we join also in strengthening the security of the free world and in seeking to brighten the prospects for world peace for our time and for all time to come.
So, again, Mr. President, let me say how pleased we all are that you have been able to come here at this time and what a great personal pleasure it is for Mrs. Johnson and me to receive you, your wife, Foreign Minister Saragat, and the other members of your party as our guests and as our friends.
