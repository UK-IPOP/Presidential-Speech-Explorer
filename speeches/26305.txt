To the Congress of the United States:
I forward herewith the annual comparison of Federal salaries with the salaries paid in private enterprise, as provided by section 5302 of title 5, United States Code.
The report, prepared by the Director of the Bureau of the Budget and the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission, compares the present Federal statutory salary rates with average salary rates paid for the same levels of work in private enterprise as reported in the Bureau of Labor Statistics Bulletin No. 1585, National Survey of Professional, Administrative, Technical, and Clerical Pay, June 1967.
In addition, the report develops July 1968 adjustments in statutory salary schedules which the President is directed to make under section 212 of P.L. 90-206, the Federal Salary Act of 1967.
Also transmitted is a copy of an Executive order promulgating the adjustments of statutory salary rates to become effective on the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after July 1, 1968.
Public Law 90-206 provides that comparable adjustments shall be made by administrative action of appropriate officers, in the salary rates of employees of the judicial and legislative branches and those of Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation County Committee employees.
