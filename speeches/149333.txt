Good morning, and hello from chilly but sunny Nantucket, where it's 49 degrees. My name is Myah Ward, and I'll be your pooler today.
One day out from the Thanksgiving holiday, there is nothing on the president's public schedule. Pool call time is 12 pm. My number 704-231-6750 if you have any questions.
Call time has been pushed back to 12:30 pm
Gather time is now 2 pm
Per the press office:
"President Biden spoke with Governor Youngkin this afternoon to offer his support and any federal assistance."
And we have a lid at 1:40 p.m. Thanks all!
