I DESIRE to express to you, Mr. President, my sincere and deep sympathy and that of the people of the United States on the death of that great son of France and friend of the United States, Aristide Briand. His loyal and unflinching fight for peace, both in Europe and in this country, endeared him to the American people who mourn his loss with you.
HERBERT HOOVER
[His Excellency Paul Doumer, President of the French Republic, Paris, France]
