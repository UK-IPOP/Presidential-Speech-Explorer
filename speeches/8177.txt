[Released February 6, 1930. Dated February 5, 1930]
My dear Mr. Deming:
I have your letter of resignation of January 28th which, of necessity, I must accept. I would, however, like to leave the precise date of such acceptance open to further agreement between us.
I should like to take this occasion to express my sincere regret that you feel you cannot continue as Chairman of the Commission. The long and effective service you have given has contributed to the upbuilding of the Civil Service, and your conduct of the office has won the full esteem of all members of the Government as well as the public at large.
I am in hopes that the time may come when your personal affairs will permit of your return to public service.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Hon. William C. Deming, Civil Service Commission, Washington, D.C.]
