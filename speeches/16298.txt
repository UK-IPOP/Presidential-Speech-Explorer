[ Released September 14, 1948. Dated August 20, 1948 ]
Dear Mr. Findling:
I read your letter of August nineteenth regarding the meeting in Senator Taft's office with the publishers and the Chicago newspapermen with a lot of interest.
It seems to me that it is entirely improper for any Senator, no matter what his politics or his rank in the Senate may be, to attempt to put the heat on one of the Executive Departments.
In my conference with the National Labor Relations Board on its organization, I informed the members of that Board and the Counsel that they constituted a part of the Executive Branch of the Government and, since the Chief Executive did not expect to interfere in their internal affairs, he expected that they would be immune to pressure from the Legislative Branch of the Government.
I sincerely hope that the Counselors of the National Labor Relations Board will bear this admonition in mind in the transaction of public business.

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Honorable David P. Findling, Associate General Counsel, National Labor Relations Board, Washington 25, D.C.]
