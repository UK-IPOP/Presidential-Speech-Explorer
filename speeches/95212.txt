 Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced 37 additional members to the Romney for President North Dakota Statewide Steering Committee. This brings the total to 42 members. These Republican leaders represent a wide cross-section of citizens throughout the State. They will help build Governor Romney's strong grassroots support in North Dakota and communicate to voters about his plan to build a stronger America through sound conservative principles.
In announcing these new supporters, Governor Romney said, "We are continuing to see our strong North Dakota team grow larger and stronger. People recognize that Washington is broken and it won't be fixed by sending the same people back â€“ just to have them sit in different chairs. I look forward to working with these Republican activists to spread my message of change throughout the state. Together, we will work to earn the support of as many North Dakota voters as possible."
These new supporters join already released members of Governor Romney's North Dakota Steering Committee including State Representative George Keiser (R-47); Julie Fedorchak, President of Liffrig Communication; Robert Harms, owner of the Harms Group and former Legal Counsel to Governors Hoeven and Schafer; former State Chairman of the North Dakota College Republicans Robert Lindberg; Harold Newman, President and CEO of Newman Traffic Signs; Lisa Carlson a banker; and Michael Little, President of the University of North Dakota College Republicans.
