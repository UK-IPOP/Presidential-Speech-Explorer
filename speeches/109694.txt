"If President Obama is assigning blame for the country's debt and deficits, he should look no further than his own budget blueprints. After piling on trillions of dollars in new debt in his first three years in office, the last thing President Obama is qualified to lecture on is responsible federal spending." —Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 "By next year, ‘a debt that has grown over the last decade, primarily as a result of two wars, two massive tax cuts and an unprecedented financial crisis, will have to be paid down,' Obama says in the prepared remarks." (Ken Thomas, "Obama Denounces 'Radical' Republican Budget Plan,"

 "For the current budget year, CBO says Obama's policies, if enacted, would generate a $1.25 trillion deficit. That's $74 billion better than the White House forecast but still represents the fourth consecutive year of trillion dollar-plus deficits." ("CBO: Obama Budget Produces 2013 Deficit Of $977B,"

 "A new analysis of President Barack Obama's budget for next year says the deficit scenario for next year isn't as rosy as the White House figured last month.

 "The National Debt has now increased more during President Obama's three years and two months in office than it did during 8 years of the George W. Bush presidency. The Debt rose $4.899 trillion during the two terms of the Bush presidency. It has now gone up $4.939 trillion since President Obama took office." (Mark Knoller, "National Debt Has Increased More Under Obama Than Under Bush,"

 "The political reality of budgeting is that voters should only believe what they can see, which is what politicians are proposing now. Promises of future spending cuts are a mirage. Mr. Obama needs to point to the mirage because his fiscal record is the worst in modern American history." (Editorial, "The Amazing Obama Budget," 
, 2/14/12)
 "Minutes earlier, the House also defeated Mr. Obama's own budget, submitted last month, on a 414-0 vote arranged by Republicans to embarrass the president and officially shelve his plan." (Stephen Dinan, "House Rejects Bowles-Simpson, Obama Budgets," 
, 3/28/12)
 "In 2011, Ryan's budget passed the House 235-193, and was then put to a vote in the Democratic-controlled Senate, where 40 members voted to support it. That same year, Republicans in the Senate forced a vote on the president budget resolution. It was defeated 97-0." (Andrew Stiles, "503—0,"
