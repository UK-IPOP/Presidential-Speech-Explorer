Mitt Romney today announced additional endorsements in Alabama. "I'm honored to receive the support of these distinguished leaders from Alabama," said Mitt Romney. "We will work together to reduce government spending, ease the regulatory burdens that are stifling small businesses and create jobs. President Obama has failed and it's time to turn around this economy." Announcing his support, State Senator Cam Ward said, "Mitt Romney is the candidate with the vision our country needs. As Governor, he balanced the budget without raising taxes and created jobs. I am confident that, as president, he will be able to get our country moving forward and put Americans back to work."
