Dear Mr. Murray:
The increasing importance of aviation as an instrument of national policy and to our national welfare makes it desirable that there be available to the government agencies, the aviation industry, and the public, a clear and comprehensive statement of the aviation policies of this Administration.
In a field so dynamic as aviation, our policies and programs must be flexible and capable of growth. It has been over five years since a broad review of U.S. aviation policy was completed; many events of major significance have occurred in the interim.
I therefore request that you, as Chairman of the Air Coordinating Committee, direct it to undertake a comprehensive review of our aviation policy, and to prepare a statement of present United States policies in the primary areas of aviation interest, for my consideration and approval. This should be done in consultation with appropriate industry, local government and private aviation groups.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
