 — 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul released the following statement concerning 
 Obamacare regulation that forces all health-care plans to cover so-called "preventive" services, which include sterilizations and all FDA-approved contraceptives—including those that cause abortions. The provision, coupled with Obamacare's individual mandate, essentially forces Americans to buy health plans that cover things they find objectionable, while offering inauthentic opportunities to seek an exemption.
See comments from Rep. Paul below:
"I am deeply troubled by the flippancy with which President Obama recently discussed regulations that are alarming and troublesome for many Americans.
"Not all Americans are comfortable with the Obama administration's decision to mandate coverage of birth control and morning-after pills, and the considerations of these people, many of them Christian conservatives, are worthy of careful consideration — not mockery.
"Many, like me, view this rigid regulatory overstep from which there is inadequate opportunity to self-exempt as payback to Planned Parenthood and big pharmaceutical companies for their support of Obamacare.
"Many others oppose it out of strict moral conviction and their voices should be heard at least to the extent that an authentic opportunity to exempt be provided. That is, until Obamacare is repealed in its entirety.
"As this mandate violates the conscience of millions of pro-life Americans, I have introduced in Congress H.R. 1099, the Taxpayer Freedom of Conscience Act, which removes all federal funding for domestic and international family planning.
"As President, I plan to defund Obamacare and all federal programs that use tax money taken from the American people to promote abortion and provide abortion services domestically and globally.
"I pledge also to veto any bill with funding for Planned Parenthood or any other international family planning regimes."
