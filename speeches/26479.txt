I AM gratified that Secretary Gardner has agreed to serve as chairman of the Urban Coalition.
As Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, John Gardner has demonstrated that he understands the dimensions and the urgency of the problems facing our cities.
All of us know that the solution to the Nation's urban problems requires a new breadth of leadership in the cities themselves; not only leadership from Federal, State, and local governments, but bold leadership from the private sector.
The Urban Coalition offers such leadership. It promises to play a significant role in the effort to find solutions for the disturbing problems of the cities.
When Secretary Gardner told me about his interest in the chairmanship of the Urban Coalition, I encouraged and urged him to accept it. I know he intends to work closely with the National Alliance of Businessmen and the Urban Institute, and I have assured him of my cooperation in the important efforts which he and the Urban Coalition are undertaking.
