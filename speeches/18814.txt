Speaking on behalf of the American people, Your Majesty, I assure you of a very warm welcome to this country.
Our people have long admired and respected Belgium. We have sympathized with her in her adversity during the periods of war. We have greatly admired the way that she has rallied from the distress and destruction of such wars and has taken her place in the ranks of those nations marching toward peace and cooperation among themselves.
So, when you travel about our country, our people first of all will be trying to show their feelings of affection to the Head of State of Belgium. But they will be trying also to show their feeling of friendship and real close association with the people of your great--even if relatively small from our standards--country.
So again, from all of us, to you and to your people, a warm welcome.
