Today, Romney for President released a new web video, "Symbol of Failure." Two years ago, President Obama went to Solyndra and touted it as an example of his initiative to create jobs. Today, the company is bankrupt and the building stands empty as a symbol of the failure of President Obama's policies.
: 
 "...[W]as a commitment with your tax dollars that ended up with the worst kind of return. $535 million for a California solar energy startup Solyndra by the Obama administration."
 "This company was the poster child for the President's green jobs initiative."
 
 "1,100 Employees Laid Off."
 "The FBI is now investigating whether the company intentionally misled the government about its finances."
 
 "Up until the very end, the Obama administration said it was money well spent."
 "We can see positive impacts right here at Solyndra."
 
 
 "Two years ago, President Obama was here to tout this building and this business as a symbol of the success of his stimulus. Well you can see that it's a symbol of something very different today. It's a symbol not of success, but of failure."
 "That is not the nature of how America works. I'm afraid the reason that the stimulus has been unsuccessful, that the turnaround has taken so long to occur, and the recovery's been so tepid is that the President fails to understand the basic nature of free enterprise in America. But I can tell you that my experience in the economy tells me how it is businesses make decisions to hire people in America. I want to use that knowledge to get Americans working again. The idea of 23 million American families out of work or stopped looking for work or underemployed is unacceptable and crony capitalism like this did not help."
