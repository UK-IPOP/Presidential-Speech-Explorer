. Mr. President, why are you going to Walter Reed?
 I'm going out to visit some of the soldiers and sailors that are—been wounded and look at the vaccination procedure.
I've been at Walter Reed a lot. I spent almost 6 months there myself as a patient. And in addition to that, as Vice President, every single Christmas, we spent all of Christmas Day at Walter Reed. These kids are amazing.
And thank God there's not as many people to visit, so all the people I'm seeing today, who are being treated, or—four of them amputees—are people who, in fact, are retired and—but they're real heroes.
And then, we're going to go see the vaccination distribution. So they're—I spent a lot of time at Walter Reed. They're great Americans. They're great people.
Nice to see you all.
Any progress on your COVID bill?
Do you support passing COVID relief through budget reconciliation?
 I'm sorry?
Do you support passing COVID relief through budget reconciliation?
 I support passing COVID relief with support from Republicans if we can get it. But the COVID relief has to pass. There's no if, ands, or buts.
Thank you.
And if it doesn't have Republican support, Mr. President?
