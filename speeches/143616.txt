Today, President Biden convened the U.S.-led Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate to urge fellow leaders of major economies to commit to faster climate action in this critical decade, with just 44 days left to the UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow. The President was joined by Leaders from Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, the European Commission, the European Council, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, and the United Kingdom as well as the UN Secretary-General. Leaders underscored the collective urgency of taking action to meet the global climate crisis. President Biden also announced, with the EU, a Global Methane Pledge that aims to cut global methane pollution 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030 through collective action. President Biden asked Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry to chair a ministerial session immediately following with China, Germany, India, and Russia.
This meeting built on the April Leaders Summit on Climate, where President Biden convened this group of countries at the leader level for the first time in more than a decade and put forward a strong new 2030 climate target. A Chair's Summary will be released later today.
