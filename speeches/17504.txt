I transmit herewith my first semi-annual report on the activities carried on under Public Law 480, 83rd Congress, as required by that Law.
Public Law 480 is an expression by Congress of its determination to deal with the abundance of our agricultural production in a constructive way. Despite the problems created by this abundance, we may be thankful we live in a land which is able to produce plentifully rather than one which suffers the affliction of food shortages.
The enclosed report includes the dollar value of the foreign currency for which commodities exported pursuant to Section 102 (a) of the Act have been sold, as well as the estimated order of magnitude of the total country programs which have been generally agreed on but not fully negotiated, together with the cost to the Commodity Credit Corporation of such sales. The report also contains a summary of the policies and operating techniques evolved for the administration of the Act during the first six months of its existence.
