THE Bureau of Customs is an old and respected arm of the Federal Government. Created in 1789 and consisting of many districts established by Congress as new territories opened and trade patterns evolved, its growth took place without particular relation to the overall organization. Its basic structure has been little changed since its founding date. Today the current and growing emphasis on international trade and travel demands a more effective administration of the customs laws to serve that essential segment of our economy engaged in foreign trade and travel.
It is my opinion that the betterments which can flow from Reorganization Plan 1 of 1965 will benefit our economy and contribute toward a smoother, more economical functioning of an important Federal agency, all in line with the aims I expressed in my State of the Union Message to the Congress on January 4.
