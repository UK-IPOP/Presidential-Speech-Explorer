Good morning from the White House, I'll be your print pooler for Vice President Kamala Harris' swearing in of Amb. Burns for the CIA.
Your pool has been tested and now awaits the ceremony, which is slated to begin at 9:30 AM.
Please reach out with any questions.
Guests in attendance:
Sarah Burns, younger daughter
Elizabeth Burns, older daughter
Lisa Carty, wife
Director Burns will be sworn in on his family Bible, which his wife will hold.
"It's absolutely baffling, it's 10 people going about three day living their lives, not bothering anybody. A police officer who is performing his duties, and with great courage and heroism," said Vice President Kamala Harris.

Bonsoir! It's a lovely spring afternoon out here on West Executive Avenue. I'll be your pooler for Vice President Kamala Harris' second and final swearing in ceremony today. Picking up where my morning colleague left off here.
Pool has been COVID tested and now awaits the ceremony to swear in former Boston Mayor Marty Walsh as Labor Secretary. That's set for 5:15 p.m.
Any questions, you know where to find me. More soon.

Pool was escorted into the VP's ceremonial office at 5:08 pm. The event started a touch later than expected.
Harris, wearing a monochrome maroon (though some may say brown) suit, entered her ceremonial office at 5:47 pm. Walsh subsequently gave his oath, and was officially sworn in a minute later. Harris did not answer a shouted question on the chances of gun control passing in the Senate.
