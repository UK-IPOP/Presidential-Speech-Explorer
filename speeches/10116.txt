 the 11th of November 1918 marked the cessation of the most destructive, sanguinary, and far-reaching war in human annals; and
 it is fitting that the recurring anniversary of this day should be commemorated by exercises designed to perpetuate peace through good will and mutual understanding between nations; and
 by concurrent resolution of the Senate and the House of Representatives, in 1926, the President was requested to issue a proclamation for the observance of Armistice Day:
 President of the United States of America, in pursuance of the said resolution, do hereby order that the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings on Saturday, November 11, 1933, and do invite the people of the United States to observe the day in schools and churches, or in other suitable places, with appropriate ceremonies expressive of our gratitude for peace and our desire for the continuance of friendly relations with all other peoples.
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 11th day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and fifty-eighth.
FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT
By the President:
