 the act of Congress approved on May 22, 1918 (40 Stat. 559), as amended by the act of Congress approved on June 21, 1941 (Public Law 114, 77th Cong., chap. 210, 1st sess., 55 Stat. 252) vests authority in me to impose restrictions and prohibitions in addition to those otherwise provided by law upon the departure of persons from and their entry into the United States when the United States is at war, or during the existence of the national emergency proclaimed by the President on May 27, 1941, or, as to aliens, whenever there exists a state of war between or among two or more states, and when I find that the interests of the United States so require; and
 the national emergency proclaimed by me on May 27, 1941 is still existing; and
 there unhappily exists a state of war between or among two or more states and open hostilities engage a large part of the Eastern Hemisphere; and
 the exigencies of the present international situation and of the national defense require that restrictions and prohibitions, in addition to those otherwise provided by law, be imposed upon the departure of persons from and their entry into the United States, including the Panama Canal Zone, the Commonwealth of the Philippines, and all territory and waters, continental or insular, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States:
 President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me as set forth above, do hereby find and publicly proclaim and declare that the interests of the United States require that restrictions and prohibitions, in addition to those otherwise provided by law, shall be imposed upon the departure of persons from and their entry into the United States, including the Panama Canal Zone, the Commonwealth of the Philippines, and all territory and waters, continental or insular, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States; and I make the following rules, regulations, and orders which shall remain in force and effect until otherwise ordered by me:
(1) After the effective date of the rules and regulations hereinafter authorized, no citizen of the United States or person who owes allegiance to the United States shall depart from or enter, or attempt to depart from or enter, the United States, including the Panama Canal Zone, the Commonwealth of the Philippines, and all territory and waters, continental or insular, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, unless he bears a valid passport issued by the Secretary of State or, under his authority, by a diplomatic or consular officer of the United States, or the United States High Commissioner to the Philippine Islands, or the chief executive of Hawaii, of Puerto Rico, of the Virgin Islands, of American Samoa, or of Guam, or unless he comes within the provisions of such exceptions or fulfils such conditions as may be prescribed in rules and regulations which the Secretary of State is hereby authorized to prescribe in execution of the rules, regulations, and orders herein prescribed. Seamen are included in the classes of persons to whom this paragraph applies.
(2) No alien shall depart from or attempt to depart from the United States unless he is in possession of a valid permit to depart issued by the Secretary of State or by an officer designated by the Secretary of State for such purpose, or unless he is exempted from obtaining a permit, in accordance with rules and regulations which the Secretary of State, with the concurrence of the Attorney General, is hereby authorized to prescribe in execution of the rules, regulations, and orders herein prescribed; nor shall any alien depart from or attempt to depart from the United States at any place other than a port of departure designated by the Attorney General or by the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization or by an appropriate permit-issuing authority designated by the Secretary of State.
No alien shall be permitted to depart from the United States if it appears to the satisfaction of the Secretary of State that such departure would be prejudicial to the interests of the United States as provided in the rules and regulations hereinbefore authorized to be prescribed by the Secretary of State, with the concurrence of the Attorney General.
(3) After the effective date of the rules and regulations hereinafter authorized, no alien shall enter or attempt to enter the United States unless he is in possession of a valid unexpired permit to enter issued by the Secretary of State, or by an appropriate officer designated by the Secretary of State, or is exempted from obtaining a permit to enter in accordance with the rules and regulations which the Secretary of State, with the concurrence of the Attorney General, is hereby authorized to prescribe in execution of these rules, regulations, and orders.
No alien shall be permitted to enter the United States if it appears to the satisfaction of the Secretary of State that such entry would be prejudicial to the interests of the United States as provided in the rules and regulations hereinbefore authorized to be prescribed by the Secretary of State, with the concurrence of the Attorney General.
(4) No person shall depart from or enter, or attempt to depart from or enter, the United States without submitting for inspection, if required to do so, all documents, articles, or other things which are being removed from or brought into the United States upon or in connection with such person's departure or entry, which are hereby made subject to official inspection under rules and regulations which the Secretary of State in the cases of citizens, and the Secretary of State with the concurrence of the Attorney General in the cases of aliens, is hereby authorized to prescribe.
(5) A permit to enter issued to an alien seaman employed on a vessel arriving at a port in the United States from a foreign port shall be conditional and shall entitle him to enter only in a case of reasonable necessity in which the immigration authorities are satisfied that such entry would not be contrary to the interests of the United States; but this shall not be deemed to supersede the provisions of Executive Order 8429, dated June 5, 1940 concerning the documentation of seamen.
(6) The period of validity of a permit to enter or a permit to depart, issued to an alien, may be terminated by the permit-issuing authority or by the Secretary of State at any time prior to the entry or departure of the alien, provided the permit-issuing authority or the Secretary of State is satisfied that the entry or departure of the alien would be prejudicial to the interests of the United States which it was the purpose of the above-mentioned acts to safeguard.
(7) Except as provided herein or by rules and regulations prescribed hereunder, the provisions of this proclamation and the rules and regulations issued in pursuance hereof shall be in addition to, and shall not be held to repeal, modify, suspend, or supersede any proclamation, rule, regulation, or order heretofore issued and now in effect under the general statutes relating to the immigration of aliens into the United States; and compliance with the provisions of this proclamation or of any rule or regulation which may hereafter be issued in pursuance of the act of May 22, 1918, as amended by the act of June 21, 1941, shall not be considered as exempting any individual from the duty of complying with the provisions of any statute, proclamation, rule, regulation, or order heretofore issued and now in effect.
(8) I direct all departments and agencies of the Government to cooperate with the Secretary of State in the execution of his authority under this proclamation and any subsequent proclamation, rule, regulation, or order promulgated in pursuance hereof. They shall upon request make available to the Secretary of State for that purpose the services of their respective officials and agents. I enjoin upon all officers of the United States charged with the execution of the laws thereof the utmost diligence in preventing violations of the act of May 22, 1918, as amended by the act of June 21, 1941, and in bringing to trial and punishment any persons who shall have violated any provisions of such acts.
(9) Paragraph 6, part I, of Executive Order 8766, issued June 3, 1941, is hereby superseded by the provisions of this proclamation and such regulations as may be prescribed hereunder.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
 at the city of Washington this 14th day of November in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-sixth.
