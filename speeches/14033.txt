My dear Judge Hutcheson:
I have received the report of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry on Palestine which you and the other American members of that Committee transmitted to me under cover of your letter of April 20, 1946â€¢
I wish to take this opportunity to thank you and your American colleagues for the untiring efforts which you have exerted in preparing the report. In performing the task which I asked them to undertake, the members of the Committee made considerable personal sacrifices and have given unstintedly of their time and energy.

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[The Honorable Joseph C. Hutcheson, American Chairman, Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry on Palestine]
