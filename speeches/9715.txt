To the House of Representatives:
I return herewith without signature--
H.R. 13975, An Act making appropriations to supply urgent deficiencies in certain appropriations for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1933, and prior fiscal years, to provide supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1933, and for other purposes.
I disapprove of the bill with great regret, as the appropriations provided for relief and other purposes are urgently needed, and with the hope that the Congress may early amend the Act.
Attached hereto is the opinion of the Attorney General who has most carefully reviewed the subject.
The difficulty lies not alone in the unconstitutionality of the provisions for legislative determination of individual tax refunds, but the further fact that in the opinion of the Attorney General those provisions invalidate these appropriations themselves.
I recognize that refunds of taxes overpaid present a subject of constant discussion and that there is a natural desire for assurance that such refunds are correctly made. Such an assurance would, I am sure, be a relief to administrative officers having to deal with this difficult subject. I would suggest, however, that if the Congress deems the system provided by existing laws should be reinforced, it should be accomplished through the creation of additional auditing machinery and not by Congress undertaking executive and administrative functions.
