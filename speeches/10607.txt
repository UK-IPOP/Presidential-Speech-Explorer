To the Nation's Christmas Tree Association:
Your annual Christmas service held at the foot of a living tree antedating the birth of Christ, is a dramatic and inspiring event of national interest. It symbolizes and vivifies our greatest Christian festival with its eternal message of unselfishness, joy and peace.
