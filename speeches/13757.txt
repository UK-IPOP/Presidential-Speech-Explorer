Dear Mr. Puryear:
Thank you for sending me the report of the Review Committee on Deferment of Government Employees under your chairmanship.
I think that a splendid job has been done in keeping down the number of deferments of employees of the Federal Government. I know that a great deal of this accomplishment is due to your own patience, energy and patriotic determination to see that the Selective Service System operated fairly and efficiently among government employees without disrupting the Federal service too much.
I take this opportunity of thanking you and congratulating you on the results achieved.

Very sincerely,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[ Honorable Edgar F. Puryear, Chairman, Review Committee on Deferment of Government Employees, Washington, D.C. ]
