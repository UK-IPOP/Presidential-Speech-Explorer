The Clinton campaign today announced its North Dakota Steering Committee, made up of over forty community leaders from across the state who will mobilize grassroots support for Hillary, leading up to North Dakota's February 5th caucuses.
Capitalizing on the momentum from Tuesday's victory in the New Hampshire Primary, the campaign is ready to compete for every vote in North Dakota.
"Senator Clinton's growing list of supporters in North Dakota reflects the respect people have for her long history of working for children and families," said former Governor George Sinner. "While some are about talk, Hillary is about action. Her actions have provided meaningful health care benefits for children and for National Guard Members and Reservists serving their country."
"There is no one better prepared than Hillary Clinton to take office in January 2009, said State Senator JoNell Bakke. "I share her commitment to the issues that matter to North Dakota and I trust her ability to get the job done, starting on day one in the White House."
