They will thank the climate advocates who helped them secure the historic climate victory through the Inflation Reduction Act, and highlight how the law's historic clean energy investments will help tackle the climate crisis and lower energy costs. They will also encourage attendees to continue driving the fight against climate change, especially with the new tools we've now secured thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act.
