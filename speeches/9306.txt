THE PRESIDENT said:
"In order further to aid employment I have instructed the various departments to undertake the speeding up of the Federal construction program by the amount of slightly less than $200 million, being the contingent appropriation in the 1932 Emergency Relief and Construction Act. The Secretary of the Treasury has notified me that the necessary funds can be now made available. By the addition of the amounts which can be applied from this fund, the total Federal construction work during this present fiscal year of all kinds will exceed $750 million. This speeding up from this additional fund will be largely in the river and harbor, flood control, and public building projects which were authorized from 2 to 5 years ago.
"The expenditure on all classes of construction since the depression began and up to next July will total about $2,300 million. This sum is more than double the normal pace and the enlarged work has, of course, been undertaken solely in aid to employment. The actual projects which will be speeded up under this additional sum will be announced by the various departments."
