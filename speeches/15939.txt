To the Heads of All Executive Departments and Agencies:
The Senate Special Crime Investigating Committee has been established to study and investigate whether organized crime utilizes the facilities of interstate commerce or otherwise operates in interstate commerce in furtherance of any transactions which are in violation of the law of the United States or of the State in which the transactions occur. I strongly favor the objectives of the Committee and I am hopeful that its work will produce constructive recommendations and results.
It is my desire that the Executive branch of the Government cooperate with the Committee to the fullest possible extent. I therefore request that all departments and agencies give Chairman Kefauver and his committee the fullest cooperation and assistance consistent with the orderly performance of the work and duties of the departments and agencies and subject only to jurisdictional and appropriation limitations.
