This afternoon at the White House, the President met with a group of Senate Democrats on trade. They had a constructive session and discussed the need to advance legislation to give the President the authority he needs to complete negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership and enforce the agreement. Members in attendance reiterated their support for TPA legislation that will pave the way for high-standard trade agreements that support good American jobs, protect our workers and environment, and ensure that the United States, and not countries like China, write the rules for the global economy. The President and Members committed to continuing work on this important priority in order to ensure workers and businesses can compete on a level playing field in the global economy.
