Gov. Scott Walker today announced campaign leaders in every one of Iowa's 99 counties, a show of strong and widespread support for his candidacy in the first-in-the-nation caucus state. With the backing of this county leadership team, Walker's already robust, active organization grows as he campaigns to win the Iowa caucuses on February 1.
Walker earlier announced the first round of his statewide leadership team, which includes nine state senators, six state representatives, and numerous other current and former elected officials, business leaders, and party activists.
Each of these Iowans knows Gov. Walker as a fighter and a winner with a proven record of reform in neighboring Wisconsin, and they've chosen to help him win the Iowa caucuses because they know he has what it takes to do the same for America. Team Walker will be announcing additional Iowa leadership in the coming weeks.
"We often talk about the importance of visiting all 99 counties, the 'Full Grassley,' but securing grassroots leadership in all 99 counties is even more valuable," said Walker. "The Iowa caucuses are the ultimate grassroots organization exercise. It's all about neighbors talking to neighbors and people encouraging their family, friends, and co-workers to turn out on a cold February night to support a candidate in whom they trust and believe. County leaders serve in an integral role in that effort. The announcement of our 99-county leadership team is a great milestone as we build a strong, effective campaign in every corner of the state. I am proud to have the support of each and every one of these leaders as we work to win the Iowa caucuses in February."
