IT IS ALWAYS unfortunate that in a contest between one's friends the good fortune of one has to be at the expense of the other.
During the last six years I have met weekly, during Congressional Sessions, with Mr. Halleek and Mr. Martin and their associates. I have relied confidently on their advice and cooperation.
To Charlie Halleek, the new Republican Leader of the House, my warm congratulations. He will be a fine leader.
To Joe Martin my heartfelt thanks for his long years of loyal and effective service. I am sure that his rich experience and wise counsel will continue to be of great value to me, to our Party, and our country.
