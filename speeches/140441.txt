Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., along with the Nevada Republican Party, today 
 suit in the First Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada in Carson City against the Nevada Secretary of State and other Nevada election officials over their disregard for the election integrity principles of transparency, accountability, and equal treatment under the law. The Campaign's lawsuit demands that the state ensure transparency in the ballot counting process, affirm the secrecy of voters' ballots, and treat all voters equally under voter eligibility and signature authentication laws.

: "President Trump has long fought for a free, fair, transparent election. Today he takes that fight to Nevada's election officials, who would apparently prefer to avoid accountability and hide ballot processing and counting behind closed doors rather than do so transparently, as the law requires. In a voting system that Democrats rammed into place less than 100 days from Election Day, the highest levels of transparency and accountability are necessary to ensure every valid ballot in Nevada countsâ€”once."

: "Transparency is paramount to ensure Nevadans the right to a free and fair election. Clark County's refusal to allow people to observe the handling of ballots and their low standards for matching signatures should disturb all voters. It is troubling that those trusted to run our elections are going to have to be compelled by the court to follow state law and protect this election. We join President Trump in his fight for transparency and accountability in Nevada's election system."
