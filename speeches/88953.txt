 The President believes the American people know how to spend their money better than the government - so government should restrain spending and keep taxes low. Since the President took office, we have cut taxes for everyone who pays income taxes, doubled the child tax credit, reduced the marriage penalty, cut taxes on dividends and capital gains, and put the Federal death tax on the road to extinction.
 In addition, since tax relief legislation was first enacted in 2001, our economy has expanded by more than $1.9 trillion - an amount larger than the entire economy of Canada.
 In addition, Democrats' budget resolution contains no plan to slow the growth of entitlement programs, which is our Nation's biggest budgetary challenge.


 Democrats' tax-and-spend policies are policies of the past. The President proposed a responsible level of discretionary spending in his FY 2008 Budget, and he will veto annual spending bills that exceed this level.
 At the rate they are now going, Democrats will have passed none of these bills before they go on their August recess. When they return, they will have less than a month before the fiscal year ends on September 30th. Democrats should get their work done and pass each bill individually by the October 1 deadline.
