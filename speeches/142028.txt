Lunch lid until 2 pm on this sunny first full day of spring.
POTUS is expected to chopped back from Camp David later today. No ETA yet. Will keep you posted.
The "lunch lid" has been extended until 5 pm.
POTUS' return from Camp David via Marine One is now expected in the 5 o'clock hour. Enjoy the glorious spring afternoon.
Marine One has lifted from Camp David.
POTUS expected on the South Lawn in about a half hour on this gorgeous spring afternoon.
Marine One touched down on the South Lawn at 5:31. Rotors still powering down.
The president stopped and spoke with pool for a minute.
Are you thinking of going to the border?
"At some point I will, yes."
Do you want to see what's going on in those facilities first hand?
"I know what's going on in those facilities."
Why isn't the message to migrants to stay home resonating and can more be done?
"A lot more. We're in the process of doing it now, including making sure that we reestablish what existed before, which was they can stay in place and make their case from their home country."
The president stepped off Marine One, saluted, turned and held Dr. Biden's hand as she stepped down. They walked together and then president peeled off as questions were shouted.
Dr. Biden waited at the doorway until he was done and they walked inside together.
We have a lid.
As it says in report #5, we have a lid for the evening.
