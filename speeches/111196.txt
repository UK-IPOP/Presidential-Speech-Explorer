"While the Obama-Biden ticket tries to convince Americans that the middle class is 'coming back,' the facts continue to get in the way. More and more families have been working harder for less, and the economy Barack Obama built isn't working for them. After four years of disappointment and broken promises, the middle class is shrinking and nearly every group of Americans is worse off. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan will jumpstart the economy by delivering 12 million new jobs and higher take-home pay for all Americans." – Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 "'Almost every group is worse off than it was three years ago, and some groups had very large declines in income,' Green, who previously directed work on the Census Bureau's income and poverty statistics program, said in a phone interview today. 'We're in an unprecedented period of economic stagnation.'" (Jeff Kearn, "U.S. Incomes Fell More In Recovery, Sentier Says,"

 "Americans nearing retirement age have suffered disproportionately after the financial crisis: along with the declining value of their homes, which were intended to cushion their final years, their incomes have fallen sharply. The typical household income for people age 55 to 64 years old is almost 10 percent less in today's dollars than it was when the recovery officially began three years ago, according to a new report from Sentier Research, a data analysis company that specializes in demographic and income data."

 "The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits climbed last week to a one-month high, showing little progress in the labor market. Jobless claims rose by 4,000 for a second week to reach 372,000 in the period ended Aug. 18 ... The four-week moving average, a less volatile measure, increased to 368,000. ... 'It's still very sluggish, and growth itself is implying we should not see any acceleration in hiring at this point,' Yelena Shulyatyeva, a U.S. economist at BNP Paribas in New York, said before the report. ... The Labor Department revised the previous week's figure up to 368,000 from an initially reported 366,000." ("Jobless Claims In U.S. Climb For Second Week To One-Month High,"

 "After four years of college, many graduates are ending up in jobs that only require the ability to operate a cash register with a smile. After commencement, a growing number young people say they have no choice but to take low-skilled jobs, according to a survey released this week. And while 63% of 'Generation Y' workers — those age 18 to 29 — have a bachelor's degree, the majority of the jobs taken by graduates don't require one, according to an online survey of 500,000 young workers carried out between July 2011 and July 2012 by
