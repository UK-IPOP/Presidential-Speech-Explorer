As Reagan explains, when the American taxpayer doesn't see the "hurt" from taxes, it's easier for liberal politicians to raise them. Cruz's VAT wouldn't show up on income tax returns or sales receipts, but it would hit every American's wages, and raise the price of everything they buy


The U.S. government has never had a VAT before. Lots of European countries do, though.  Having a VAT in addition to income taxes has allowed governments across Europe to explode in size — to the point where in many cases they control way over half of the economy.


As a tax on consumption, the VAT is a new way for the federal government to raise revenue, but also one that will be layered on top of state and local sales taxes. That means a really high combined tax rate on everyday purchases in lots of states, higher than in many European countries.
