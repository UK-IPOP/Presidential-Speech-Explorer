WELL, Mr. President, as we complete our talks, I wish to express appreciation to you for coming to the United States and for giving me the benefit of your views, not only on the relations between our two countries, but also on United States policy generally in the Pacific and in the Asian area.
I have found these talks most helpful. And I am sure that not only are we going to continue to have the relations, the good relations, we have had in the past between the Republic of Korea and the United States, but that U.S. understanding of the great forces now at play in Asia, forces that will shape the future for the last third of this century, that that understanding has been increased as a result of having the benefit of your views.
And finally, I want to say that I look forward, during my term of office, at some time of returning to Korea and of visiting your country again and of seeing you and Mrs. Park again at that time.
