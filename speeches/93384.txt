The Clinton Campaign today announced the Washington DC for Hillary Steering Committee made up of a diverse group of community leaders from across the District.
"Hillary is clearly the most experienced and qualified candidate in the Presidential race. She will be a great leader for America, and an extraordinary role model for women in the United States and around the world," said Pauline Schneider, attorney and former President of the District of Columbia Bar.
"We need a leader who has the vision, the demonstrated leadership, and the ability to restore America's standing in the world," said Alejandra Castillo, founding member and member of the Board of Directors for the Dominican American National Roundtable. "Not only does Hillary appreciate the importance of America's standing in the world, she will also work to provide District residents with long overdue voting rights," Castillo added.
"Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to deliver the change that this country needs," said Councilman Jack Evans.
"Her 35-year record fighting for children and families makes Hillary uniquely qualified to be President and hit the ground running on her first day in office," said Councilman Bill Lightfoot.
"We've seen growing support in Washington DC, and I'm honored that these community leaders are joining our effort to change America," Clinton said.
