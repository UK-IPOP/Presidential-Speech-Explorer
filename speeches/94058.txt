Manchester, NH -- Senator Barack Obama continued his dialogue with New Hampshire voters this morning, sitting down with Granite Staters who would benefit from his middle class tax fairness policy. The event at the Black Orchid Grille in Nashua was the first of several stops over the next three days at which Obama will be taking questions and offering straight-forward, honest answers on the issues that matter most to voters.
As President, Obama will provide a tax credit to middle class Americans, implement a universal homeowner's tax credit for those who don't itemize their deductions, eliminate income taxes for seniors making less than $50,000, and simplify the tax code so that millions of Americans can complete their return in less than five minutes. He will also level the playing field for American business by closing corporate loopholes and cracking down on offshore tax havens. His full plan can be viewed

"It used to be that if you worked hard enough, you could always make ends meet," said roundtable participant John Tourgee of Sharon. "These days, it seems like you can't even find the string. Obama understands what everyday Americans are going through. As President, I know he'll fight for the middle class and bring about the change we need."
