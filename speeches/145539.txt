"President Biden has nominated a full slate of nominees to the Federal Reserve that are committed to the board's dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment and represent a diversity of backgrounds that will bring important new perspectives. We continue to face new challenges as we confront the pandemic and its variants, but we have made remarkable strides to put our economy on strong footing. I am confident these nominees will build on that progress. I also know that these individuals will respect the tradition of an independent Fed, as they work to fight inflation, support a strong labor market and ensure our economic growth benefits all workers. I strongly believe that a fully staffed Federal Reserve is critical to our economic success, and I urge the Senate to act swiftly to confirm these nominees." [

Lisa is a renowned economist whose work has deepened our understanding of women & people of color in the economy - 2 groups long marginalized by the field. At a time when racial and gender stratification looms large in the COVID-19 recovery, Lisa's voice will be a crucial one to have on the Board. I offer my warmest and most heartfelt congratulations to Lisa on this well-deserved nomination. " [

 "Sarah Bloom Raskin is a tough and thoughtful financial regulator with decades of experience at both the state and federal levels. In the important role of Vice Chair for Supervision, she brings a commitment to protect the American people that has been sorely missing from the Fed Board for years. Lisa Cook is a first-class economist with particular expertise in the drivers of innovation and the economic consequences of racial discrimination. I look forward to learning more about Philip Jefferson and his record in the coming weeks." [

 "With these nominees, President Biden is showing the country what a Federal Reserve standing on the side of workers and their local communities looks like. We need leaders who will ensure that workers and their families reap the benefits of the economic growth they create, and who will not repeat past mistakes that led to a booming recovery for Wall Street, and a weak one for everyone else. Throughout their long, distinguished careers, they've proven they understand how our economy works – and who makes it work. They will also bring important perspectives to the Federal Reserve Board about the economic issues women, Black and brown workers, and rural and industrial communities across the country face. I urge my colleagues to support these nominees and look forward to their hearings before the Banking and Housing Committee." [

 "President Biden just nominated three outstanding champions for working people to the Federal Reserve. Here's why we need to confirm them. Professor Sarah Bloom Raskin knows we need to make our economy stronger and safer. As @federalreserve Vice Chair for Supervision, she'll rein in Wall Street and fight for community banks and small businesses on Main Street. Dr. Lisa Cook is a celebrated economist and is committed to fighting for women and people of color in the workforce and innovation. The @federalreserve needs her voice. An expert on the economics of poverty and unemployment, Dr. Philip Jefferson is ready to fight for working people and families in every community." [
