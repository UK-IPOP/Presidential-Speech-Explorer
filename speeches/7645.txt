My dear Governor Young:
I have your letter of August 26, tendering your resignation as Governor and Member of the Federal Reserve Board. The reasons for this action on your part which you have explained to me in person and which you mention in your letter are sufficiently compelling to forbid my insisting that you remain, much as I am tempted to do so. You have made a great sacrifice during the last three years, and I do not believe that I ought to ask you to continue to do so.
You have the right to feel that you have rendered real public service. You brought to the position of Governor sound banking judgment based on many years of experience and a comprehensive knowledge of financial, industrial and agricultural conditions throughout the country and of our national banking system. In very difficult times you have performed the important duties of your office with excellent judgment, tact and courage, and I shall find it difficult to replace you. I wish to express not only my own appreciation of your devoted public service, but my conviction that your resignation will be received with regret by the country as a whole. It is my understanding that you wish your resignation to be effective September 1st, which is agreeable to me.

With best wishes for your future success and happiness, believe me,

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Honorable Roy A. Young, Governor, Federal Reserve Board, Treasury Department, Washington, D.C. ]
