ON BEHALF of the people of the United States of America, I extend cordial greetings and best wishes to the peoples of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the occasion of their national holiday, which this year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Soviet Government. It is my hope that the good will of the peoples of both countries can find expression in joint efforts toward the achievement of a stable and lasting peace throughout the world.
