TODAY'S ACTION on the tax bill is good news for the country. I am proud of the Congress. I am glad for the taxpayer. I want to express my gratitude to the House which passed the tax bill last session, and to the Senate whose members worked hard to assure swift but full consideration of it in the last few weeks.
I hope the conferees will quickly resolve their differences. Each day's delay is costly. Their action will give our free enterprise economy new life in the form of increased consumer buying, new investment, and more jobs. And it will keep America growing.
This has been an important day for all of us.
