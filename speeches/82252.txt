Taking Action to Improve Spectrum Management
The Federal Spectrum Task Force will produce a set of recommendations for improving spectrum management policies and procedures to increase the efficiency and beneficial use of spectrum by the Federal Government.
The Department of Commerce will hold a series of public meetings to assist in its development of a set of recommendations for improving policies and procedures for use of spectrum by state and local governments and the private sector.
Facilitate a modernized and improved spectrum management system;
While the Initiative will facilitate improvements in spectrum management, the Administration has achieved significant successes within the current system.
The Administration has identified new spectrum for advanced third generation (3G) wireless services and technologies for consumers. In July 2002, the Department of Commerce released a plan in concert with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Department of Defense to make 90 MHz of spectrum available in the future for 3G wireless services while accommodating critically important spectrum requirements for national security.
