Good evening from the White House. Your pooler was tested and pool has gathered for POTUS arrival. It's 9 pm.
Per travel pool, Marine One was wheels up early in Delaware.
POTUS arrived at 9:17 pm. He stepped off at 9:19 pm followed closely by the First Lady. POTUS went straight to motorcade and didn't appear to hear a shouted comment from someone in the pool (I believe it was about Father's Day).
Motorcade took off at 9:21pm.
Per White House:

Steve Ricchetti, Assistant to the President & Counselor to the President
