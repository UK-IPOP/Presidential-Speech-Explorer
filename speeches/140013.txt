Good morning,

White House pool has been coronavirus tested, and we're on the grounds standing by.

The president has nothing on his public schedule today, however, and the press office says it has no scheduling updates at this time. 


A few minutes ago, after she finished a television appearance on the North Lawn, the pool caught up with White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany as she walking back to the West Wing.

"Hey guys, gotta run," she said as she approached reporters.

Asked when she thought she might hold a press briefing, McEnany replied, "Probably later on."

She did not provide additional context for when a press briefing might take place. 


The White House press office just called a lunch lid until 2pm. 


After what appeared to be another TV hit some reporters (but not the print pooler) spotted Kayleigh McEnany outside again.

Asked if press would see the president today, she said per another reporter: We'll see. 


Reporters at the White House spotted Peter Navarro as he was walking about to the West Wing from a television hit on the North Lawn.

Asked if he'd seen or spoken to the president today, he said they are "private conversations. We don't report those" and kept on walking. 


?The White House has released the pool for the day, calling a travel/photo lid moments ago.

Celebratory shouting rang out through the press workspace after the press office announcement at 8:13 pm that signaled to pool reporters that they could go home.
