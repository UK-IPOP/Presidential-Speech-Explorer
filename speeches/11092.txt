My dear Mr. Morrow:
I have received your letter of resignation as Ambassador to Mexico. I must, of course, accept it.
In doing so, I should like to take occasion to express the appreciation I have, and which I know the whole country feels, for the able representation you have given. It has been a service marked with achievement and one in which every one of us must take satisfaction.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Honorable Dwight W. Morrow, Ambassador to Mexico, Department of State, Washington, D.C.]
