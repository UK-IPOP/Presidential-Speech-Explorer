 the founders of our Nation were men of initiative, self-confidence, and determination; and
 these traits are developed in our youth through actual participation in the establishment and operation of various worthy enterprises with the help of public-spirited citizens; and
 the experience gained by our youth in participating in small-scale business enterprises can be of great value in stimulating their spirit of leadership and civic responsibility; and
 thousands of American businessmen voluntarily give of their time, their counsel, and their experience for the benefit of these young businessmen, called Junior Achievers; and
 the Congress, by Senate Concurrent Resolution 81, agreed to January 28, 1960, has requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the week beginning January 31, 1960, as National Junior Achievement Week:
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week of January 31 through February 6, 1960, as National Junior Achievement Week; and I urge all our citizens to observe the week by honoring Junior Achievers and their volunteer adult advisers through appropriate ceremonies.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this thirtieth day of January in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fourth.

DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:

CHRISTIAN A. HERTER,
