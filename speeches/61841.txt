The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 3246, but urges Congress to include appropriate funding offsets in the bill.

H.R. 3246 would decrease offsetting receipts and thereby increase net outlays; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. The bill does not contain provisions to offset the decreased receipts. OMB's preliminary PAYGO estimate is presented in the table below. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from this estimate.
