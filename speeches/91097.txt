"Mayor Giuliani successfully worked to get guns out of the hands of criminals in order to transform a city out of control. By being tough on crime and enforcing the laws on the books, New York City's murder rate was cut by 66 percent. The bottom line: the best way to deal with gun-related crime is to prosecute the criminals and enforce the laws already on the books."
– Maria Comella, Deputy Communications Director

 "According to FBI statistics, New York is the safest large city in the nation. From July 1, 1996, through June 30, 1997, the graphs showed 44% fewer major felonies and 60% fewer murders." (John J. Goldman, "Giuliani's State Of Mind Goes From N.Y. To National," Los Angeles Times, 10/18/97)
 NBC's Pat Dawson: "Over the last four years, FBI statistics show burglaries and robberies in New York have been cut nearly in half, murders by 60 percent. The drop in crime is a national phenomenon. But the place that was once a symbol of urban violence in America has seen its crime rate fall faster and farther than any other big city in the country." (NBC's "Today," 11/25/97)
 Criminals who commit crimes with a gun must go to prison for the mandatory sentence. They must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law – 5-year sentences for violent or drug trafficking crimes committed with guns, and a mandatory additional 25 year sentence for each subsequent violent or drug trafficking crime committed with a gun.
 Mayor Giuliani Supports the Parker Decision and hopes that it will be reaffirmed on appeal firmly establishing that the Second Amendment applies to individuals. He believes that Parker will strengthen the Castle Doctrine, underscoring the right of a person to protect themselves in their own home.
