 mental illness constitutes one of the Nation's most difficult and costly problems; and
 there is urgent need for more trained personnel to carry on research on mental illness and the treatment of the mentally ill; and
 citizens' voluntary mental health organizations—national, State, and local—are working diligently in this battle to build sound mental health; and
 the efforts of these private organizations and the mental health fund which they are raising through public subscription are deserving of generous support by all of our citizens; and
 the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, through the National Institute of Mental Health of the Public Health Service, and also State and local governments, are mobilizing appropriate governmental resources to aid in the fight for sound mental health for all citizens of this Nation; and
 Senate Resolution 93 of the 83d Congress, 1st Session, adopted May 5, 1953, requests the President of the United States to issue a proclamation designating the week beginning May 3 and ending May 9, 1953, as National Mental Health Week:
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning May 3 and ending May 9, 1953, as National Mental Health Week; and I urge the people throughout the Nation to cooperate in the fight against mental illness, and invite the communities of the United States to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this eighth day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-seventh.
