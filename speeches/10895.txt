THE MATTER is a tempest in the teapot. The facts are these: On Friday (July 17), while still in Paris, Secretary Stimson received a cablegram from Washington setting forth a concrete proposal by the United States for consideration of the London Conference. Mr. Stimson immediately discussed the essentials of this proposal with the representatives of France and Germany. Then garbled accounts of these discussions of the American proposal appeared in the European newspapers and to some extent in the American press on Monday (July 20). Then press cables went from Washington to London on Monday that there was a new proposal. Mr. Stimson naturally denied there was a new proposal for he had received no instructions since Friday.
The American proposal transmitted Friday was issued here on Tuesday (July 21 ) to correct inaccurate accounts of the discussions that were based on the proposal that Mr. Stimson got on Friday.
