"President Obama may be convinced his economic policies 'worked' — but his White House isn't so sure, downgrading economic growth projections for this year and the next. It's just the latest reminder that the Obama economy isn't working for millions of middle-class Americans. From Day One, Mitt Romney will implement pro-growth policies that will restore economic growth and get Americans back to work." — Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 "The mid-session review from the Office of Management and Budget also projected lower economic growth in 2012 and 2013 than previously anticipated, and calls for $195 billion in economic stimulus to address an economy that 'still faces significant headwinds.'"

 "The 2013 budget the president submitted today does not come close to meeting this promise of being reduced to $650 billion for fiscal year 2013. The president noted in that 2009 speech the Obama administration inherited a $1.3 trillion deficit. The deficit was similarly $1.3 trillion in 2011, is projected to be $1.15 trillion in 2012, and the president's budget claims it will be $901 billion in 2013."
