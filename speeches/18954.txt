THE INTERIM Report submitted to me by the Cabinet Committee on Price Stability for Economic Growth, of which Vice President Nixon is chairman, contains recommendations for checking inflation that are important to all Americans. I am therefore making the Report public and sending copies of it to all members of the Congress. I urge that the Congress consider anew the Committee's three recommendations, all of which require legislative action. Each of these recommendations has been previously submitted by me to the Congress.
The Committee is continuing its work and will issue statements from time to time to inform the public on questions related to economic growth and price stability. A sound public understanding of the facts bearing on these questions is needed if we are to find constructive answers to them.
