Dear Mr. Secretary:
Your thoughtfully prepared policy statement on Africa is wholeheartedly approved.
You know of my keen personal interest in relations with the African countries. We have both felt the spirit and dynamism of this continent and its people. I believe we now have a special opportunity to maintain and to expand our present relationships and am pleased that you and your staff have made so complete and positive an examination of the paths that are available to us.
You may count on my full support in the fulfillment of this program. It establishes a good foundation upon which we can respond to African needs and build that relationship of cooperation and understanding which we desire.

Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
[The Honorable William P. Rogers, The Secretary of State, Washington, D.C. 20520]
