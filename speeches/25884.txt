[THIS IS] a landmark report of landmark achievements. I can think of very few documents that I have seen during my Presidency that have given me more satisfaction than Secretary Cohen's report. The events and actions recorded here--in leadership, in legislation, and in administration--are the events and actions by which this administration will be remembered.
The momentum we have now must not be allowed to slacken. Mr. Cohen is showing the way to maintain and to quicken the pace.
