Mr. President, Mrs. O'Kelly, Your Excellency the Archbishop, Distinguished Guests and Friends:
I think each of us can sense something of the spirit of warm friendship that has been brought to our people during these two or three days by the President of Ireland and his lovely lady.
We thank Ireland for sending him over here. We thank them for coming.
This spirit--this changed spirit in Washington that I sense so keenly-is reflected even among ourselves. It seems to me I am getting more smiles from the Democrats than I have had in a long time. And certainly I feel more kindly to everybody in the city because of having met you, President O'Kelly.
I think it is well that it is so. In the years that stretch out ahead of us, we must be friendly among ourselves. We must be close to our good friends--and Ireland is among the front rank of our good friends. We must have faith in ourselves. We must have faith in each other--and faith in our God.
These are the sentiments that I have been listening to from our friend, the President, for these past two or three days. I have had an uplift of spirit because of the things I have heard during this visit.
So it is with extraordinary pleasure and satisfaction that I ask you all to stand to drink with me the health of the Irish people--and, above all, to their President and his lady.
