My dear Crumbine:
You have perhaps seen some of the statements made by Governor Roosevelt of Porto Rico as to the condition of Porto Rican children. There seems to be a very genuine case for some systematic service.
I would like very much if the American Child Health Association could send down a staff of competent people, prepared to examine the whole situation in Porto Rico from a health, a nutritional, and a social point of view so far as it affects children.
I do not know what it would cost, but if you will take this up with Mr. Rickard it will serve as a recommendation from me to him to find you the necessary funds.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
