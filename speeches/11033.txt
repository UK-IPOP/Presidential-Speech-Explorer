THE PRESIDENT has been in communication with the floor leaders of the Republican and Democratic sides of the Senate with a view to securing cooperation for the prompt passage of the appropriation bills through the Senate at the forthcoming session. Both leaders have expressed their desire and full cooperation to accomplish this. The fear and apprehension which have been expressed over reports that delay or filibuster would be resorted to to force an extra session of the Congress, have therefore no foundation.
