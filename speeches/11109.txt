I CORDIALLY commend to all the people the observance of Better Homes Week beginning April 26. The Better Homes movement has for several years played a highly important part in encouraging a more beautiful home architecture, improved decoration of house interiors, more practical kitchen arrangements, better planning of gardens, and in every way an enhancement of the comfort and attractiveness of homelife. Everything that can be done to encourage home-ownership and to make homelife pleasanter is a distinct contribution not only to social well-being but to the highest spiritual values of life. The Better Homes movement has done distinguished service in this field and deserves the warmest support of all our people.
