Jeff Johnson, Marco's Minnesota state chairman, had this to say:
Following Marco's enthusiastic rally here on Tuesday, I'm so proud that these legislators from across our state are joining me in supporting the Rubio campaign. Marco continues to earn support because he offers a positive vision for America's future that will strengthen our country and expand opportunities for future generations. Now is the time for conservatives to unify behind Marco because any vote not for him is a vote for Donald Trump, which our party cannot afford.
I am proud to announce my support for Marco Rubio and honored that I can do it alongside so many of my colleagues. We are going to be caucusing for Marco on March 1st because he is the one candidate that can beat the Democrats this fall and bring back strong conservative principles to the White House.
Our momentum in Minnesota has been sky high since the rally on Tuesday and getting the support of these key leaders only adds to it. We are so happy to have earned their support and look forward to them spreading the word to their constituents, neighbors and friends about why they need to caucus for Marco on Tuesday.
