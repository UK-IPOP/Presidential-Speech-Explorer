Dear Mr. Shelton:
I have read with interest the plan for the First Annual Patriotic Pilgrimage of the Newspaper Boys of America. Such a plan, providing for the cooperation of the newspapers of the country generally, gives promise both of a fine recognition of character and enterprise amongst the boys and of a valuable step in their education in patriotism and government.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
