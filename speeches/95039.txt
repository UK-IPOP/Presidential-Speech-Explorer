 The bill lowered marginal rates, eliminated the marriage penalty, and doubled the child tax credit. (H.R. 1836, CQ Vote #170: Adopted 58-33: R 46-2; D 12-31; I 0-0, 5/26/01, McCain, Levin and Stabenow Voted Nay)
 "The Senate adopted a $1.35 trillion tax cut bill, but neither of Michigan's U.S. senators, Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow, voted for the reduction. Twelve Democratic senators joined with all 50 GOP senators to adopt the tax cut. But Michigan's two Democratic senators were not among them -- even though some economists consider this state to be in the midst of a recession. The Senate version of the tax cut was a compromise with the administration, and supported by most moderate Democrats. It is disappointing that Sens. Levin and Stabenow weren't part of that group."

 The comprehensive bill lowered taxes by $350 billion over 11 years â€“ including increasing the child tax credit and eliminated the marriage penalty.

 "Just four months into his presidency, George W. Bush has accomplished the number one goal he set during the election campaign, providing substantive tax relief to American workers. The $1.35 trillion, ten year tax relief package -- $250 billion smaller than originally proposed -- is not everything we had hoped, - but it is more than could have been expected given the sharp divisions in Congress and the revulsion of the Democratic leadership to letting go of taxpayer dollars ...But if anything, this tax cut bill is overly cautious." (Editorial, "Tax Cuts: A Very Good Start," 
, 5/28/01)
 "Opponents of tax relief claimed it would primarily benefit the wealthy. But a number of measures in the bill, including marriage penalty relief, increased child and education credits, an expansion of the 15 percent bracket and a new 10 percent bracket, will provide relief to lower- and middle-income earners that is larger proportionately than their share of the tax bill."

 "Acknowledging the incentives his company had thrived on are a diminishing return, General Motors Corp. Chief Executive Rick Wagoner made his strongest pitch Friday for President George W. Bush's tax-cut plan that would eliminate taxes on dividends and accelerate income-tax rate cuts." (Jeffrey McCracken, "Wagoner Backs Tax Cuts," 
, 5/3/03)
 "Earlier in the week, Wagoner and his counterparts at Ford Motor Co. and the Chrysler Group met with Bush in Dearborn to voice their support for his tax plan. 'We think the package on the table or something like it is the answer. We vote for bigger versus smaller,' Wagoner said in a question-and-answer session after his speech. 'We need a plan that is consistent with sound economic policy. We think the Bush plan meets all those conditions.'" (Jeffrey McCracken, "Wagoner Backs Tax Cuts," 
, 5/3/03)
 "Ford lauded Bush for a presidential 'can-do spirit' and said the automakers 'support his package.'" (Patricia Montemurri, "Jobs, Election Play Role In Visit,"
