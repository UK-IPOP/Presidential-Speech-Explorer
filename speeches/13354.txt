THE ARGENTINE Ambassador, who has just returned from Argentina, reviewed with the President and the Secretary of State the steps which his government has taken and is continuing to take in fulfillment of its commitments undertaken in the Final Act of the Inter-American Conference on Problems of War and Peace. He expressed the view of his government that no obstacle remained to discussions looking toward the treaty of mutual assistance contemplated by the Act of Chapultepec. The President indicated his willingness to renew the consultations with the governments of the other American Republics initiated by the United States memorandum of April 1, 1946, on this subject.
