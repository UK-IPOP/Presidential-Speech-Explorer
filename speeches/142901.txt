Yesterday afternoon, Secretary of Education-designate Dr. Miguel Cardona joined leaders from disability organizations in the education field for a virtual roundtable discussion. Dr. Cardona thanked the leaders for their time and counsel, for their hard work during the pandemic, and said that he viewed the meeting as the beginning of an ongoing partnership.

Participants discussed issues affecting blind students, deaf students, those with speech-related disabilities, as well as higher education, in particular student loan forgiveness. Other participants expressed urgent issues that will require long-term attention, including significant disproportionality - when districts identify, place, or discipline students from any one racial or ethnic group at disproportionate rates to their peers, the school to prison pipeline, additional higher education priorities including universal design, and employment opportunities. Participants noted the disproportionate effects the pandemic has exacerbated for students with disabilities, particularly around access and equity.

Additionally, Dr. Cardona affirmed participants' comments that we must challenge a deficit mentality, noting that all students have diverse abilities and their abilities make schools better. He himself has seen firsthand how schools with diverse populations created a culture of community.

Representatives from the following organizations, along with other individual advocates for people with disabilities, joined the Secretary-designate:
