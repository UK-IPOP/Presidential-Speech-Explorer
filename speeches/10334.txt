My dear Commander Edwards:

That was a most encouraging telegram you sent me this morning.
I would be glad if the veterans throughout the country could know the character of the men claiming to be their representatives who have been in Washington since the adjournment of Congress. It is the impression of our government services that less than half of them ever served under the American flag.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Edward C. Edwards, Commander, Crosscup Pishon Post, American Legion, Boston, Mass.]
