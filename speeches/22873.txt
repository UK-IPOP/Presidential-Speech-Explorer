Dear Mr. Secretary:
I have reviewed the report of the Federal Inquiry Board on the Florida East Coast Railway dispute. The report reaffirms my concern over the impact of this dispute on our defense and space programs. It is in the public interest that this dispute be promptly resolved.
Accordingly, I am requesting the National Mediation Board to immediately contact the parties with a view to the prompt resumption of negotiations. If these bargaining efforts prove unproductive, I urge the parties to give serious consideration to your recommendation to submit their issues to final and binding arbitration.
In addition, I request that you keep me informed of all subsequent developments with regard to this dispute in the event that additional actions are required.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
[Honorable W. Willard Wirtz, Secretary of Labor, Washington, D.C.]
