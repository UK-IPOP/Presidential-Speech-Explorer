"Mitt Romney spent his career in the private sector as a chief executive, where he helped create jobs and turn around major enterprises. Congressman/Senator Rick Santorum, on the other hand, has spent his career in Washington. Rick Santorum is part of the problem, so he can't be part of the solution." â€”Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 "In 1990, Mr. Santorum, then 32, was first elected to the House of Representatives, and four years later rode an anti-incumbent wave into the Senate. He won re-election in 2000, but after a bitter and expensive campaign lost his bid for a third term in 2006 against his Democratic challenger, Bob Casey, the Pennsylvania state treasurer." (
