Pool is still holding at the hotel. First working session was to begin now.
Pool has asked WH for any update on Potus sked or protocols in light of Cambodian PM Hun Sen's positive covid test.
After about a delay of more than half an hour, motorcade is rolling. Pool did not see Potus.
COVID update, per WH: "The President tested negative this morning and is not considered a close contact as defined by the CDC."
Pool will inquire as to the type of test.
Motorcade rolled through residential areas en route to the site, arriving at the site and pausing at 10 am. It's not entirely clear if we're still in the motorcade, as we're at a complete stop with view blocked.
Small groups of people dotted the roadway, usually with police and black beret wearing local community watch groups keeping an eye. Many were snapping cell phone pics.
The route was lined with decorations made from coconut leaves, called penjor.
Thanks to co-poolers Jim Tankersley and Patsy Widakuswara for the continued assist!
It turns out that Potus did in fact peel off during that earlier pause. Pool did not see him do that.
Pool is now entering the hold area at the Kempinsky hotel after final arrival at 10:09 am.
Below is some info from the WH on the many people involved. Pool continues holding at the Kempinsky, where there is good A/C and an artificial lagoon view.

Pool is relocating to the G20 site in the Kenpinski, as if 4:16.
This comes after a long lull in the hold, punctuated by a triple monkey sighting on the way to vans.
Pool made it inside after a messy scrum about 4:40. Security was very tight and people from other delegations were yelling to get in
Co pooler caught Trump posing with Indian PM Modi. Looks like they flashed peace signs.
Fellow pooler asked Biden about his reported meeting with Turkey's Erdogan. He didn't respond, but appeared to hear.
Later we saw him interact with Van ser Leyen.
Potus is now seated at head of table.
Thanks to Seung Min Kim of AP for the fill!
One fix on prior report: your pooler accidentally typed the name of a former president who is also having a big day.
It was Biden with Modi.
Potus has started remarks on infrastructure.
Pool is expecting a readout of what is being called an unplanned pull-aside with Erdogan, as has been reported in Turkish media.
In his remarks, Potus spoke about a range of investments by US and multilateral institutions around the world.
Biden ticked through investments announced previously by a group formed by the Group of 7 nations, widely seen as a counter to China's Belt and Road program. "I want to emphasize the word 'investments'," he said.
He then announced the Just Energy Transition Partnership with Indonesia (the White House has released a fact sheet), which seeks to mobilize $20 billion in public and private money "to support Indonesia's efforts to reduce emissions" and transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy
Yellen and Blinken sat behind him, nodding along.
Also speaking were Van der Leyen and Japanese PM Kishida, who spoke about a series of Japanese investments, including geothermal projects.
Pool is leaving after the PM while Trudeau is speaking.
Thanks again to Tankersley.

You may have seen the WH just sent a readout of the pull-aside with Erdogan, copied here.
Pool has spotted Modi and Scholz, up close but with no info.
Pool is now standing out front likely soon moving to vans.
President Biden met with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on the margins of the G20 Summit. President Biden expressed his deep condolences to President Erdogan and the people of Turkiye on the acts of violence in Istanbul and made clear we stand with our NATO Ally. President Biden expressed his appreciation to President Erdogan for his efforts to renew the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which they both agreed has been critical to improving global food security amid Russia's war and that the Initiative must continue. The two also discussed continued close coordination on NATO Alliance issues, and other issues of regional and global concern.
Pool continues to wait with the motorcade.
No update on whether the potus has progressed with his two scheduled closed press bilats, with dinner event to come.
We're parked near several G20-branded charging stations, motors idling.
Motorcade is rolling as if 7:30. We did not see potus.
Motorcade rolled back to the RON and immediately got a lid after Potus split off.
Potus had been scheduled to attend a dinner and cultural event. Pool has sought guidance on why he evidently decided not to attend. Will send along any updates on that.
Thanks again to copooler Jim Tankersley and local expert Patsy W.
Good night all!
Pool reached out to an administration official, who responded by way of background:
"It's not COVID. He just had spent a full day in meetings and needed to attend to a few things tonight (nothing urgent!). He spoke to Widodo to send his regrets about missing the dinner and Widodo said it was not an issue and P looks forward to seeing him at the mangrove thing tomorrow."
Gnite all
Potus is still dialing up the States with congratulatory / condolence calls.
Per the WH:
After the first G20 working session in Bali, Indonesia, the President made congratulatory calls to Arizona Governor-elect Katie Hobbs and Representative Susie Lee.
The President also completed a call to Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak.
