THE PRESIDENT'S Commission on Higher Education has submitted the first volume of its report. I look forward to studying this report and I hope that our citizens will also examine it carefully.
Higher education in our Nation is confronted today with tremendous responsibilities. Colleges and universities are burdened by great overcrowding and a shortage of teachers. Most importantly, however, we are challenged by the need to insure that higher education shall take its proper place in our national effort to strengthen democracy at home and to improve our understanding of our friends and neighbors everywhere in the world. It was for these compelling reasons that I asked this Commission to report to me and to the Nation. I am confident that the report will help all of us to understand this challenge. I am equally confident that it will prove to be of great value in meeting the challenge successfully.
A carefully developed program to strengthen higher education, taken together with a program for the support of elementary and secondary education, will inevitably strengthen our Nation and enrich the lives of our citizens.
The members of the Commission have worked diligently. They have taken time from their many tasks willingly, in order to lay before the people of the country their judgments on the great problems to be met by higher education. All of us should be grateful to them for their work.
