His Excellency

Kwame Nkrumah

Prime Minister of Ghana
It is with warm pleasure that I extend in my own name and on behalf of the American people most cordial greetings and felicitations to you and your countrymen upon the occasion of the independence of Ghana. This event is a cause of pride and satisfaction to the United States as it must be to all free nations. Ghana, which has demonstrated its devotion to peace and the maintenance of democratic political institutions and its dedication to the social and economic advancement of its people, is a welcome addition to the family of nations.
The Government of the United States looks forward to close and friendly relations with the Government of Ghana and to an early exchange of Ambassadors.
