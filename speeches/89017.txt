The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of U.S. Conference of Mayors President Doug Palmer and named him a co-chair of the campaign's newly-formed Mayors Council.
Made up of more than 100 current and former mayors from across the country, the Mayors Council will advise the campaign on policy and outreach. The council represents a broad cross-section of America, including urban, rural and suburban cities and towns that reflect the nation's diversity.
"Across America there is a growing hunger for change," said Palmer, Mayor of Trenton, New Jersey. "At a critical time in our history, Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to lead from her first day in office. She has shown a deep understanding of the issues facing our communities, from improving education to creating new jobs to helping keep our neighborhoods safe, Hillary will be a partner we can count on in the White House."
The following leaders joined Hillary's Mayors Council today.
