I beg to transmit herewith a report made to me by the Secretary of War upon the conditions found by him to exist in the island of Porto Rico during a visit made at my request. The people of Porto Rico, if we may judge by the expressions of the political parties in the island, have been anxious to secure amendments to the so-called "Foraker law," and especially a declaration by Congress making those who are now Porto Rican citizens under the Foraker law American citizens.
I commend to Congress the consideration of the report of the Secretary of War and recommend the adoption of his suggestions, which have been embodied in a bill amending the so-called "Foraker Act." This bill is at the disposition of Congress. The Secretary suggests not an act making all Porto Rican citizens American citizens with or without their consent, but an act to provide machinery by which Porto Rican citizens who shall make the proper application for citizenship to a proper court shall become American citizens upon taking the oath of allegiance to the United States. After a certain date the right to vote and to hold office is to be confined to American citizens, and only those American citizens are to enjoy the franchise who can satisfy certain educational or property qualifications. At present there is manhood suffrage in the island, and, as a very large percentage of the voters are unable to read or write, the electorate is not one which should be intrusted with the government. It is much better in the interests of the people of the island that the suffrage should be limited by an educational and property qualification.
I do not comment on the other changes in the laws recommended by the Secretary, because he sufficiently discusses them, and his arguments need no addition from me.
