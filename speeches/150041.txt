U.S. President Joseph R. Biden and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador relaunched the U.S.-Mexico High-Level Economic Dialogue (HLED) in 2021 to advance shared strategic economic and commercial priorities. The HLED provides a platform for the United States and Mexico to leverage their strong economic integration to foster regional prosperity, expand job creation, promote investment in our people, and reduce inequality and poverty. Since 2021, HLED collaboration has focused on four thematic pillars described in the highlights of the accomplishments below. Between August 31, 2021 and September 12, 2022, the two governments hosted at least 21 stakeholder outreach engagements with civil society, the private sector, academia, and non-governmental organizations to inform these efforts.
