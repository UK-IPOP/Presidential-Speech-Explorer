Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen:
Mr. President, I am very happy and proud to welcome you to the United States. We consider this to be your second country and you are always welcome on this soil.
On your first trip 45 years ago, you came to interest America in the cause of Irish freedom, much as Benjamin Franklin, the envoy of the American Revolution, visited Ireland in 1772.
Freedom for Ireland has been the driving mastering passion of your life, and America is honored today to have back a native son who has become Ireland's liberator, Ireland's senior statesman, and Ireland's President.
There is one man who is not here with us today who would especially be proud of this moment--John Fitzgerald Kennedy. President Kennedy loved Ireland and he held for you, Mr. President, personally the deepest affection.
When he returned from Ireland last summer, we all knew how impressed he had been with the great reception that had been given him by the people of his ancestral land.
Now it is our turn and our privilege to greet you, Mr. President. To no other Irish leader do we owe a greater debt than you for the contributions which Ireland has made--and is making--to the building of a world community under the rule of law.
This is the country of your birth, Mr. President. This will always be your home. You belong to us, Mr. President, just as in a very special way John F. Kennedy belonged to you.
So, this morning, it gives me great pride and pleasure on behalf of all of the American people to welcome you home. We are glad that you are here.
