Pool Reports by

Good morning from the White House, where Vice President Kamala Harris is scheduled to swear in Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen at 12:00pm.
The event will take place in the East Landing overlooking the Treasury building, per White House. VP is not expected to take any questions, but I'll pass along any relevant color/attendees as I spot them.

From the scene: 
Hi!
Your pooler Eugene here. Pool loaded into the motorcade at 2:51.
We are headed to NIH for VP Harris' second dose of the Moderna vaccine.
Could not see her as the pools view was blocked by one of the vehicles.
Motorcade rolled out at 3:15.
From official guidance:
The Vice President and the Second Gentleman will receive the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, which will be pooled press.
Motorcade arrived at NIH at 3:35.
See info below from VP Press Team:
Nurse administering shot below.
Dr. Francis Collins, director of NIH, will deliver brief welcoming remarks.
Nurse Practitioner, National Institutes of Health
Judy Lai Yee Chan is a Nurse Practitioner in the NIH Occupational Medical Service, which is a branch of the Division of Occupational Health and Safety and will be administering YOUR vaccination. She joined the NIH community in February 2020 and has been a key leader in the COVID response, serving as the Branch Chief in theIncident Management Structure overseeing Medical Operations and is currently serving as the Operations Chief of the NIH COVID-19 Vaccine Clinic.
The room is pretty empty outside of press pool and secret service. The nurse is on the stage with a table, one chair presumably for the Vice President who just walked in.
Everyone is masked. And we were handed a clean mask to put on.
