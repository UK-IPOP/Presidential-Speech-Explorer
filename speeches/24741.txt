Dear Mr. Chairman:
I was pleased to receive your telegram of October 20. The United States will participate in the meeting of the Inter-American Economic and Social Council (IA-ECOSOC) at Buenos Aires on March 13 if that date is concurred in by most of the member states. The United States warmly appreciates your fixing the date to coincide with the Fifth Anniversary of the Alliance for Progress as a tribute to the memory of President Kennedy.
In accordance with your excellent suggestion, the United States Representative to the IA-ECOSOC will be included in the United States Delegation to the Inter-American Conference scheduled to open in Rio de Janeiro on November 17. Mr. Jack H. Vaughn, United States Coordinator of the Alliance for Progress, will shortly be named United States Representative. He will be prepared to exchange ideas on matters raised in the CIAP letter.
I take this opportunity to express again my deep personal interest in individual and collective efforts to give greater impetus to our vital Alliance for Progress.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[His Excellency Edgardo Seoane, Chairman, Inter-American Economic and Social Council]
