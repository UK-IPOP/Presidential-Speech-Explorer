The Strategy emphasizes the need to (1) improve global access to the life sciences to combat infectious disease regardless of its cause; (2) establish and reinforce norms against the misuse of the life sciences; and (3) institute a suite of coordinated activities that collectively will help influence, identify, inhibit, and/or interdict those who seek to misuse the life sciences. Through this Strategy the United States Government will work with domestic and international partners on the following seven objectives to 
 against misuse of the life sciences to support biological weapons proliferation and terrorism:

•

•      
: Reinforce a culture of responsibility, awareness, and vigilance among all who utilize and benefit from the life sciences to ensure that they are not diverted to harmful purpose.

•      
: Improve threat identification, notification, and assessment capabilities as well as our understanding as to the global progress and distribution of the life sciences to help identify and understand new and emerging challenges and inform appropriate actions to manage the evolving risk.

•      
: Identify, sensitize, support, and otherwise safeguard knowledge and capabilities in the life sciences and related communities that could be vulnerable to misuse.

•      
: Further hone our abilities to identify and stop those with ill intent to reduce the risk of single, multiple, or sequential attacks.

•      
: Ensure the United States Government is advancing cogent, coherent, and coordinated messages.

•      
: Promote a robust and sustained discussion among all nations as to the evolving biological threat and identify mutually agreed steps to counter it.
