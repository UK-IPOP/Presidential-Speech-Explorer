"The choice voters will face in November could not be more clear. President Obama has spent the last four years implementing policies that have devastated the middle class. And four more years will only deliver more of the same — fewer jobs and fewer economic opportunities for the next generation. As president, Mitt Romney will deliver a new direction by implementing pro-growth policies to jumpstart the economy and create 12 million new jobs for American workers." — Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 "But in the past two years, an increasing number of coal-powered electricity plants across the country have announced closures.

 "As part of the explanation for the general economic pessimism, 78 percent of small businesses believe that taxation, regulation and legislation from Washington make it harder for businesses to hire more employees — and 74 percent blame the recent health care reforms passed by the Obama administration for creating an impediment to job creation."

 "'Business owners remain on edge regarding the tidal wave of federal government regulation that has been advanced or proposed over the past two years. ... The pain of the harsh recession was intensified and lengthened by this hyper-regulatory environment,' Karen Kerrigan, president of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, wrote in a Jan. 12 letter to Issa."  (Philip Rucker and David S.

 "Researchers determined the plan would actually subject 2.1 million business owners to higher rates; specifically, those who pay pass-through taxes, like most partnerships, LLCs and S-Corporations.

Rules still need to be written to carry out much of Obama's signature first-term domestic policy initiatives, the health-care overhaul and the Dodd-Frank law regulating the financial industry."
