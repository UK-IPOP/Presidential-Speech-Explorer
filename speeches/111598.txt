"President Obama may want voters to think he's hard at work and has 'a lot on his plate,' but it seems the only thing he's working on is his golf game. After 11 rounds of golf, 120 fundraisers and zero meetings with his Jobs Council over the past six months, it's clear that President Obama is only working to save one job, his own." — Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman

 "President Barack Obama is at odds with some of his handpicked outside advisers on hot-button election topics such as regulations and corporate taxes. Many of the recommendations at issue stem from the president's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, a group of business and labor leaders with whom Mr. Obama hasn't met in six months."

 "The U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of just 1.5 percent from April through June, as Americans cut back sharply on spending. The slowest growth in a year adds to worries that the economy could be stalling three years after the recession ended."

 "A U.S. economy that plodded along in the first three months of the year likely grew even less in the April-June quarter.
