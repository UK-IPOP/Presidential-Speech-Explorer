 it appears that certain sections of the right-of-way for United States Highway Route 70 are included within the White Sands National Monument in the State of New Mexico, established by Proclamation No. 2025 of January 18, 1933, and enlarged by Proclamation No. 2108 of November 28, 1934; and
 it appears that it would be in the public interest to exclude from the said monument such sections of the said right-of-way:
 President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 2 of the act of June 8, 1906, ch. 3060, 34 Stat. 225 (U.S.C., title 16, sec. 431), do proclaim that the White Sands National Monument in the State of New Mexico is hereby modified by eliminating therefrom all sections now included therein of the right-of-way for United States Highway Route 70.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 29 day of August in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and thirty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-third.
FRANKLIN D ROOSEVELT
