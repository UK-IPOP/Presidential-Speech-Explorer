 Hourly compensation rose at a 5.7 percent rate in the first quarter. Personal income rose 0.5 percent in March.
 Real after-tax income has risen by $2,398 (8.2 percent) per person since January 2001.
 The unemployment rate is 4.7 percent.
 The Dow is up 8.6 percent this year and closed yesterday at a six-year high.
