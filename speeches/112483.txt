"On day one, President Romney will immediately approve the Keystone pipeline, creating thousands of jobs and strengthening our energy security. He will introduce tax reform that lowers rates and rewards job creators. And he will begin replacing Obamacare with commonsense health care reform. Compare that to what the first day of President Obama's second term would look like. On day one of the Romney presidency, we will begin restoring the greatness of America." â€“Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
