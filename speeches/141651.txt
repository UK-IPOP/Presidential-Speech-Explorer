They're here for a roundtable to promote President Biden's American Jobs Plan.
Some may have received two "#1" reports. Reports will be labeled in proper succession from here.
Clarification on report #1.
Information on next two stops was not for publication. Embargoed until those events start.
It's 10:56 a.m. EST and Mr. Emhoff and Sec. Buttigieg are speaking with union member representatives at Teamsters Union Hall in Raleigh, North Carolina about the American Jobs Plan.
They are talking about investing in more jobs, green infrastructure and promoting workers' rights to unionize.
They are also speaking about supporting frontline workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.
"Transit workers are frontline workers," Emhoff said. "They need to be treated as such."
"A lot of people weren't able to work on Zoom," Emhoff said. "It's been a tough year out there taking care of people like you all have."
Sec. Buttigieg spoke about investing in trade jobs, not higher-entry jobs, when investing in infrastructure.
"These are not mysterious jobs," Buttigieg said. "We're talking about needing carpenters and electrical workers."
Mr. Emhoff and Sec. Buttigieg are now leaving Teamsters Union Hall in Raleigh, North Carolina at 11:09 a.m. EST.
Emhoff spoke about the need to invest in clean energy to benefit the general public.
"Climate should not be a political issue. Everyone needs clean water and clean air, " Emhoff said. "This is not controversial."
It's 11:59 a.m. EST and Mr. Emhoff and Sec. Buttigieg have arrived at North Carolina State University's campus in Raleigh, North Carolina to tour the Center for Additive Manufacturing and Logistics.
They are here to promote research and development investment within the American Jobs Plan.
They will be joined by Congresswoman Deborah Ross of North Carolina's 2nd congressional district, which covers all of Raleigh, and by Raleigh City Council member Stormie D. Forte.
It's 1:03 p.m. and Mr. Emhoff and Sec. Buttigieg have left North Carolina State University's campus in Raleigh, North Carolina.
Along with those reported in pool report #6, they were also joined by Rep. David Price of North Carolina's 4th congressional district, which covers other parts of the Raleigh metropolitan area, including Durham and Chapel Hill.
They went to the Additive Manufacturing Lab where NC State staff showed them objects produced with 3D printing technology.
They then went to the Pavement and Asphalt Testing Lab, where staff and students showed them the mixing process of a new pavement formulation that extends the lifetime of paved surfaces.
Finally, Emhoff and Buttigieg toured the Construction Facilities Lab where the development of construction materials and systems are researched to enhance infrastructure sustainability.
This was all a part of seeing research and development for infrastructure taking place at NC State. President Biden's American Jobs Plan calls for more funding in infrastructure R&D.
Emhoff and Buttigieg are now going to lunch before going to their final stop in Raleigh.
It's 2 p.m. and Mr. Emhoff and Sec. Buttigieg have arrived downtown at the Raleigh Union Station.
They're here with North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Raleigh Mayor Mary-Ann Baldwin, Rep. David Price (NC-4), Rep. Deborah Ross (NC-2) and Amtrak President Stephen Gardner.
They're here to talk about the American Rescue Plan, which President Biden signed in March, as well as the administration's infrastructure proposal, the American Jobs Plan.
The Raleigh Union Station began operation in July 2018.
Also, I was sent a written statement from North Carolina League of Conservation Voters from their Director of Governmental Relations Dan Crawford:
"North Carolinians love traveling the Good Roads State from the Outer Banks to the Blue Ridge Parkway. President Biden's American Jobs Plan will make it easier and less expensive for us to explore our beautiful state in electric cars we can charge readily or in rail cars from Asheville to Wilmington and beyond. It's a jobs plan, a tourism plan, a health plan, an energy infrastructure plan, and a climate plan rolled into one."
Press conference in Raleigh, North Carolina, at the Raleigh Union Station downtown wrapped up at 2:43 p.m. EST.
Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Rep. David Price (NC-4), Rep. Barbara Ross (NC-2) and Raleigh Mayor Mary-Ann Baldwin spoke at the press conference.
They mostly talked about President Biden's initiative going forward with the American Jobs Plan to invest in infrastructure. Cooper, Price and Ross talked more from a North Carolina context. Baldwin spoke even more local from a Raleigh perspective. Price, Ross and Cooper emphasized the goal of expanding Amtrak rail from Raleigh directly to Richmond, Virginia. Here's some key quotes from each person below:
Emhoff
Buttigieg

Cooper

Price

Ross

CORRECTION: Rep. Ross' first name is Deborah, not Barbara.
