The Administration opposes the enactment of H.R. 2050, which would give the District of Columbia (D.C.) Board of Parole exclusive jurisdiction over the parole terms of prisoners convicted of violating D.C. laws or any U.S. laws applicable exclusively to D.C., regardless of the institution in which the prisoner is confined. H.R. 2050 is objectionable for the following reasons:


â€” Prisoners in Federal institutions should be subject to the same parole conditions, and H.R. 2050 would add to the number of situations in which different parole standards are applied to such prisoners.
