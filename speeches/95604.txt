The Clinton campaign announced Thursday that 126 more Georgians have been added to the Campaign's Georgia leadership, including community leaders, elected officials, and activists from across the state who will mobilize grassroots support for Hillary leading up to Georgia's February 5th primary.
"The next President is going to face some huge challenges, and Georgia families know that Hillary Clinton is the only candidate in this race who has the experience and leadership to get right to work from day one in the White House," said Congressman John Lewis.
"From putting an end to the war in Iraq to providing universal health care, Hillary Clinton will deliver the change Georgia families need," said Ambassador Gordon Giffin.
"Hillary Clinton has a 35 year record of fighting for change, with a focus on the well-being of children. That sets her apart from the field. She is ready to do the job for us from her first day in office," said State Rep. Mary Margaret Oliver.
Hillary Clinton receives widespread support throughout the state of Georgia. She has received the endorsement of every statewide elected Democratic official and several other prominent local and national leaders. Last weekend the campaign opened its state headquarters in Atlanta, and will be opening more offices throughout the state in the near future. Nearly 3,500 volunteers have signed up to help with the Hillary Clinton for President Campaign in Georgia, and the Campaign has recruited seasoned organizers in all 13 Congressional Districts.
