Yesterday, thanks to President Biden's efforts and the successful passage of the American Rescue Plan, tens of millions of American families began to see their much-needed first monthly Child Tax Credit payment hit their bank accounts or mailboxes. Treasury estimates that families received roughly $15 billion dollars yesterday in the first-ever round of monthly Child Tax Credit payments.
The Child Tax Credit -- which has been expanded through the American Rescue Plan -- provides hard working families with more breathing room to cover expenses and pay the bills, and covers nearly 60 million children. The expanded Child Tax Credit is one of the largest-ever single-year tax cuts for families with children.
State and local elected officials and community advocates praised the President for his commitment to making historic investments in our kids, our families, and our economic future – because when American families do well, our nation thrives.
 "Huge news from the @WhiteHouse – today New Mexico working families will begin receiving the results of the expanded Child Tax Credit, the first of monthly payments that will make an incredible difference in the lives of so many New Mexicans. More info:
