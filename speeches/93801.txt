Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced it will launch a new radio ad in New Hampshire, entitled "Chances." The ad highlights Rudy Giuliani's commitment to give Americans more control over and access to health care with affordable and portable free-market solutions including tax exemptions for those who chose to purchase their own health insurance.
Script and audio link are below.
 "I had prostate cancer, five, six years ago. My chance of surviving prostate cancer, and thank God I was cured of it, in the United States, 82%. My chances of surviving prostate cancer in England, only 44% under socialized medicine."
 "You and I should be making the decisions about what kind of health care we get with our doctors, not with a government bureaucrat. What we need to do is to give people a $15,000 deduction for a family, a $7500 deduction for an individual so they can go out and by their own health insurance."
 "If we do that, and we end up with a market of 50, 60 million Americans buying their own health insurance, without a mandate, the cost of health insurance will come down and the quality will come up.
 "Government has never been able to reduce costs. Government never increases quality".
 "We have the best health care system in the world. We just have to make it better."
 "Rudy Giuliani. Leadership. Principle. Results."
 "I'm Rudy Giuliani and I approved this message."
