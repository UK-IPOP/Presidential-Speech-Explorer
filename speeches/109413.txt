On Ann Romney's birthday, Romney for President released a new web video titled "Happy Birthday, Mom."
: 
 "Daughter"
 "Ann and I fell in love when we were in high school. It doesn't happen to a lot of people. She was fifteen years old when I really took notice of her, and I was a senior and she was a sophomore. I gave her a ride home from a party. She had come with someone else. I kissed her at the door, and I've been following her ever since."
 "Wife."
 "Craig, will you do me a favor? Would you please sing a song for us?"
 "Rudolph the red nose reindeer had a very shiny."
 "Mother"
 "Ok hold on."
 "This is a professional diving lesson. Matthew, now you show me how a jack knife is supposed to be done."
 "Who, me?"
 "Yeah."
 "I can't."
 "I know Matt that's why we want to see it."
 "Come on, Matt"
 "Do it in good form, come on."
 "We love it."
 "Isn't he a sweet baby?"
 "Sweet baby."
 "Probably the toughest time in my life was standing there with Ann as we hugged each other and the diagnosis came. She's a remarkable woman, and she's gone through some tough times. She had diagnosis of MS. She's had breast cancer, and my feelings and passion for Ann haven't changed in the slightest over the years other than they've become stronger."
 "Survivor"
 "Guys wait for me. Guys wait for me! One. Two. Three."
 "Grandmother"
 "Monkeys."
 "Does it taste a little bit like a doughnut or does it taste like a cookie?"
 "Tastes like a doughnut."
 "Benjamin, are you his big brother?"
 "Yeah."
 "Come here and say hi to Craig."
 "Mom?"
 "Turn around and say hi to daddy."
 "Craigy hi! How ya doin?"
 "Movie."
 "Take a movie?"
 "Yeah."
 "Did you watch it on TV?"
 "Yeah."
 "Now he's happy. He's got us both."
 "I'm happy I've got you both too."
 "I'm happy in life as long as I've got my soul mate with me. Life is all about the people you love."
 "Happy Birthday, Mom!"
