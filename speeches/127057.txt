As the pivotal Florida primary on March 15 draws near, Floridians should not be stampeded into thinking that it's all over. In the Republican race, in particular, they have an opportunity to change the course of a deeply discouraging — even embarrassing — campaign narrative by boosting the chances of native son Marco Rubio, the best remaining candidate with a mostly positive message and a practical chance to win the nomination.
Donald Trump would have voters believe his campaign has gained unstoppable momentum, but a deeper look raises doubt.
Despite the big wins, Mr. Trump is not yet on track to secure the nomination, according to a delegate count by the Associated Press. Thirty-five states have yet to be heard from. His negatives remain very high, especially among important sectors of the electorate (80 percent negative among Latinos). In seven of the states up for grabs on Super Tuesday, he received no more than 35 percent.
