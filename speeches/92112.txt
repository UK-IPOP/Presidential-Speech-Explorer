The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsements of 12 Pennsylvania State Legislators, demonstrating Hillary's growing support in the Keystone State.
"At a time of great uncertainty at home and abroad, Hillary Clinton is the right choice for Pennsylvania and America," State Senator Raphael Musto said.
"Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to deliver the change Americans want," said State Representative Thomas Blackwell IV. "She's ready to hit the ground running on her first day in the White House."
"I am honored to have the support of these local leaders who will be critical in spreading our message of change across Pennsylvania and the nation," Clinton said.
