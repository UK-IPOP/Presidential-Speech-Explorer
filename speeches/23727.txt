IT IS with deep regret that I learned of the decision of President Diosdado Macapagal of the Philippines to postpone his visit to the United States next month. I understand that President Macapagal's decision resulted from his country's disappointment over the failure of the Congress on May 9 to enact the Philippine War Damage Bill.
A new bill designed to fulfill this obligation has now been introduced in Congress with bipartisan sponsorship. The Congressional leadership has assured me that it will again give its full support for the legislation, and I am hopeful that the new bill will pass. I am hopeful, too, that this disappointment will not be allowed to alter the harmonious relations between our countries and our profound and lasting friendship.
I sincerely hope that the many expressions of good will and sympathy by our people and our press will be accepted by the people of the Philippines as the true measure of our friendship and understanding. We continue to look forward with pleasure and anticipation to welcoming President Macapagal to the United States in the near future.
