"Ringing"

TV :30
 It's 3 am, and your children are safe and asleep.
But there's a phone ringing in the White House and this time the crisis is economic.

Home foreclosures mounting, markets teetering.
John McCain just said the government shouldn't take any real action on the housing crisis, he'd let the phone keep ringing.
Hillary Clinton has a plan to protect our homes, create jobs.
It's 3 am, time for a president who's ready.
 I'm Hillary Clinton and I approve this message.
