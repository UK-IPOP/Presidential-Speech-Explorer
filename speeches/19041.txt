THIS MORNING I signed a bill authorizing an increase in the interest rates on all United States Series E and H Savings Bonds.
Later, in approving the recommendations of the Secretary of the Treasury for a rate of 3 3/4 %, I stated:
"To my mind there is no better way of saving, no more effective way of strengthening our power for peace, than to own United States Savings Bonds.
"To buy these bonds is to express faith in America.
"It helps provide the economic strength in both our Government and in individual families on which our freedom depends.
"I hope that the making of both old and new Savings Bonds even more attractive will serve as a renewed invitation to every citizen to buy and hold these 'shares in America.'"
