WELL, OVETA, this is a sad day for the administration. My mind goes back to the day I first met you in London--in 1942 I suppose it was--when you came over there as head of the WAG Corps, something entirely new in my experience. But you were the first one that sold it to me, and I must say it proved itself, under your leadership, to be one of the finest organizations that the Army has ever had.
In these last two years--two years and a half--your talents have again been devoted to the service of your country, and most effectively. And I would think I could best express the feeling of the Cabinet toward you by quoting the Secretary of the Treasury--I am sure he wouldn't mind. The other day in my office, shortly after you had told me that you would have to go, I said to him that we were going to lose you. And his eyes popped open and he said, "What?--the best man in the Cabinet !"
That is the feeling that the whole Cabinet has towards you. I assure you that none of us will forget your wise counsel, your calm confidence in the face of every kind of difficulty, your concern for people everywhere, the warm heart you brought to your job as well as your talents. We are just distressed to lose you, but the best wishes of the entire executive department--indeed, I think of the Congress and all Washington that knows you--will go with you as you go back, and we will be very hopeful that you will have many fine, happy years there from here on.
[Following Mrs. Hobby's response, the President resumed speaking.]
Oveta, if I had known that you felt like that, I never would have accepted your letter of resignation.

Mrs. Secretary--I can still say that--thank you very much.
