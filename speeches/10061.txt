 on May 22, 1819, the Steamship 
 sailed from Savannah, Georgia, on the first successful transoceanic voyage under steam propulsion, thus making a material contribution to the advancement of ocean transportation; and
 the Congress by Joint Resolution of May 20, 1933, designated May 22 of each year as National Maritime Day and requested the President to issue annually a Proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe such National Maritime Day;
 President of the United States of America, do call upon and urge the people of the United States to observe May 22, 1934, as National Maritime Day by displaying the flag at their homes and other suitable places, and I hereby direct that Government officials display the flag on all Government buildings on that day.
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 4" day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and fifty-eighth.
