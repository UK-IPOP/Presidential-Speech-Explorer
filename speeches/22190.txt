I AM happy to congratulate the officers and members of the newly organized Iran-America Society. Your group is yet another sign of the growing interest in the cultural and artistic heritage of Iran in this country, which will be seen by many Americans in the exhibit "7,000 Years of Iranian Art," to be inaugurated here on June 5 by His Imperial Majesty the Shahanshah. The United States prizes the fullest possible exchange of culture and ideas between nations in the belief that the understanding so engendered between peoples is an important asset to peace. I remember with pleasure my visit to Iran and I am especially pleased to see this new kind of exchange with a country sharing so many common interests with the United States in the international field.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON.
[Mr. Ralph E. Becket, Chairman of the Board, Iran-America Society, Washington, D.C.]
