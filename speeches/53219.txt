The Administration continues to believe that having sufficient private capital at risk, ahead of the deposit insurance fund, is an essential safeguard for American taxpayers and is needed to prevent future losses. More than any other factor, the massive losses incurred by thrifts — which this legislation funds — were a result of growth without the discipline of prudent levels of capital that exist for national banks.

Accordingly, the Administration will work in conference and in the House of Representatives to strengthen the capital requirements in the final legislation. If the capital requirements in the bill presented to the President are not sufficiently strong, or if the Administration's financing mechanism is brought on-budget or altered in violation of the recent budget accord, the President's senior advisers would recommend a veto of the legislation.

The Administration also has other concerns about several specific provisions of the bill and will work to ensure that they are resolved. The Administration's other major concerns are outlined below.
