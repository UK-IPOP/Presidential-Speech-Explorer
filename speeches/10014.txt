THE APPROPRIATION BILLS for the next fiscal year for the State, Justice, Commerce, and Labor Departments--together with the independent offices bill, have now been reported out from the House Appropriations Committee. The President recommended total appropriations for these services of $1,058,741,556, including permanent appropriations amounting to $81,104,553 or $977,637,003 excluding permanent appropriations. The House committee recommended $1,106,172,818 excluding permanent appropriations or $128,535,815 increase over the president's recommendations. To this should be added $1,268,480 for deferments which will be required in the fiscal year making a total increase for these services of $129,804,295.
Since the statement of January 20, which showed on the same basis net increases of about $35 million for the Departments of Agriculture, Interior, Post Office, Treasury, and War, further action by the House on the War Department bill has modified this figure to about $33,500,000.
The totals of the increases over the President's recommendations to date are therefore $163,319,642 and if finally adopted by the Congress will make an increase in the estimated deficit by that amount.
