His Excellency

Ramon Magsaysay

President of the Philippine Republic
I send greetings, on the behalf of the people of the United States, to our friends in the Philippines on this day of memories and dedication. It is fitting that Bataan Day should be the chosen time to commemorate Philippine-American friendship for it reminds us of the unity that was ours in times of stress and trial.
The ensuing fourteen years have brought ever-increasing understanding and cooperation. This year you will mark the tenth anniversary of the independence of your nation. We can be justly proud of the example of international brotherhood which we have provided during the past decade.
Our hearts should be filled with gratitude toward those brave men whom we remember on this day--not only for their service in war, but for the legacy of courage and inspiration which they left for us to follow in time of peace.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
