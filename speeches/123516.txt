Marco Rubio's superior judgment on national security matters makes him the right choice for commander-in-chief. As a member of the Select Committee on Intelligence, Marco has a deep understanding of the threats we face. He knows the world is a safer place when America has the strongest military and the knowledge of how and when to best use it. After 7 years of Barack Obama weakening our national security, we do not need a Republican president who brags about voting to cut defense spending. We need Marco Rubio in the Oval Office to rebuild our armed forces and restore America's leadership in an increasingly troubled world.
