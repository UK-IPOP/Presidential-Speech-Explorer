ARLINGTON, VA -- Today, McCain-Palin 2008 released its latest web ad, entitled "Embarrass." Ahead of tonight's debate, the ad highlights Joe Biden's penchant for saying the unpredictable whether it be very right or very wrong. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 "'I think I probably have a much higher IQ than you do,' Biden snapped. Nor did he let it go at that, replying that he was graduated from law school in the top half of his class and suggesting that the questioner was 'a heartless technocrat' for caring more about law school grade averages than about leadership abilities. Biden made his remarks during one of those meet-the-candidate gatherings that do not rate extensive coverage. But a C-Span camera was there, homing in on Biden's mirthless grin as he chewed out the hapless questioner." (Frank Clifford, "Face-Offs Proliferate,"

 JOHNS: "Still, he is a master of the quick recovery, even after making you cringe. Like recently, when he told a man in a wheelchair to stand up." BIDEN: "Chuck, stand up, Chuck. Let them see you. Oh, God love you, what am I talking about?" (CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360 Degrees," 9/15/08) 
 
 
 BIDEN: "In Delaware, the largest growth in population is Indian Americans, moving from India. You cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I'm not joking. Oh, it's gigantic." (MSNBC's "Scarborough Country," 7/6/06) 
 JOHNS: "Still, he is a master of the quick recovery, even after making you cringe. Like recently, when he told a man in a wheelchair to stand up." BIDEN: "Chuck, stand up, Chuck. Let them see you. Oh, God love you, what am I talking about?" (CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360 Degrees," 9/15/08) 
 
 
 BIDEN: "Hillary Clinton is as qualified or more qualified than I am to be vice president of the United States of America. Let's get that straight. She's a truly close personal friend. She is qualified to be president of the United States of America. She's easily qualified to be vice president of the United States of America. And quite frankly, it might have been a better pick than me but she's first rate." (CNN's "American Morning," 9/11/08)

 JOE BIDEN: "We want to take money and put it back in the pocket of middle-class people." ABC'S KATE SNOW: "Anybody making over $250,000..." BIDEN: "Is gonna pay more." SNOW: "Is going to pay more." BIDEN: "You got it. It's time to be patriotic, Kate. Time to jump in. Time to be part of the deal. Time to help get America out of the rut." (ABC's "Good Morning America," 9/18/08)
