 The President stressed the need to promote greater energy independence through the use of renewable energy sources like biodiesel and ethanol and new technologies like clean diesel.
Background: Moving Towards Greater Energy Independence Through Biodiesel And Clean Diesel Technologies
 Farm products and food waste like soybeans and recycled cooking grease can produce biodiesel, a clean-burning automotive fuel. Biodiesel delivers economic benefits by supporting American farmers, not foreign oil producers, and it produces less pollution.
 Energy efficient hybrid and clean diesel vehicles offer the same features consumers desire, but travel much further on a gallon of fuel than conventional vehicles.
