Pool Reports by 
, 
Good morning,
Before arriving at the White House complex for COVID testing, your pooler was informed of a lunch lid until 4 p.m.
I'll have more later.
The White House passes along the following:
Today, the President is meeting with members of his national security team at the White House. The President has no public events scheduled.
The in-town pool has gathered and is heading to the vans for a departure.
The motorcade rolled out of the White House at 5:26 p m., headed west.
The motorcade arrived in Georgetown at Holy Trinity Catholic Church at 5:33 p.m.
We passed many onlookers taking photos along the way, including folks in the line outside of Georgetown Cupcake.
POTUS exited the church at 6:20 p.m.
He did not stop to acknowledge shouted questions about infrastructure from the press pool gathered outside.
We're rolling at 6:22 p.m.
The motorcade returned to the White House at 6:28 p.m. The president entered the building at 6:29 p.m.
Upon the president's return, a lid was called. No ice cream stops today.
Enjoy your Saturday night.
