What did you mean by no DACA deal, Mr. President?

Perfect weather.

 Mr. President, what do you mean by no DACA deal?

Mexico has got to help us at the border. If they're not going to help us at the border, it's a very sad thing between two countries.

Mexico has got to help us at the border. And a lot of people are coming in because they want to take advantage of DACA, and we're going to have to really see.

They had a great chance. The Democrats blew it. They had a great, great chance, but we'll have to take a look. But Mexico has got to help us at the border. They flow right through Mexico. They send them into the United States. It can't happen that way anymore. Thank you.
