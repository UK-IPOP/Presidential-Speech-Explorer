I AM APPOINTING Gen. Mark W. Clark to succeed Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway as Commander in Chief of the U.N. Command for Korea and as Commander in Chief of the far East Command of the U.S. Armed forces.

In making this appointment, I want to emphasize that General Clark will continue the policies which have been so ably carried out by General Ridgway with regard to the United Nations action in Korea, including, if possible, the achievement of an honorable armistice.
