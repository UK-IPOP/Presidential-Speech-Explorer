IN VOTING its approval of the water treaty with Mexico, the Senate today gave unmistakable evidence that it stands firmly in support of the established policy of our Government to deal with our Good Neighbors on the basis of simple justice, equity, friendly understanding and practical cooperation. By this action of the Senate, the United States and Mexico join hands in a constructive, business-like program to apportion between them and develop to their mutual advantage the waters of the rivers that are in part common to them.
