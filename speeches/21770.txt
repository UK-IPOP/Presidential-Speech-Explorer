Mr. RODNEY M. LOCKWOOD,


DEAR ROD: This is just a note to tell you how pleased I was to learn from Charlie Rhyne, national chairman of Volunteers for Nixon-Lodge, that you have accepted the appointment as chairman of their homebuilders' committee. I want you to know how much I personally appreciate your willingness to accept this position.
The importance of the homebuilding industry, and the need for continued stimulation of its growth as a vital segment of our economy cannot be overemphasized. Despite the recent accomplishments of the housing industry, some stubborn problems stand in the way of achieving our common objective of better homes for all Americans, and the Federal Government must help provide the economic climate and the incentives which will make this objective obtainable. To achieve these ends, we must rely increasingly on the active participation of interested and informed citizens in developing suitable programs.
For my own part, one of the most gratifying aspects of public life is the support of enthusiastic people such as yourself who are willing to assume a responsible role of leadership within their communities and professions, and who, in so doing, inevitably make a substantial personal contribution to the national scene.
With appreciation and every good wish,
Sincerely,
