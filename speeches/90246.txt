Hillary Clinton received the endorsements of two dozen prominent California officials and community leaders today, on the eve of California's Democratic state convention in San Diego.
"I'm endorsing Hillary Clinton for President because I know her and admire her," said California Treasurer Bill Lockyer. "She's been my good friend and our state's great ally for more than a decade. Nobody understands Californians, the California Dream, and the vital importance of California to our nation's success better than Hillary Clinton. And Hillary Clinton is -- far and away -- the only candidate who is ready to lead the country now, without any on-the-job training."
State Assemblywoman Fiona Ma said, "Hillary is the most qualified candidate and is ready to lead this country from day one. Hillary knows the White House, Congress, and has the respect of world leaders. Most importantly, Hillary has been long-time advocate for the Asian American and Pacific Islander community, and I know that she will continue her commitment when she becomes President."
Clinton will address the convention at 10:15 a.m. tomorrow at the San Diego Convention Center.
