ARLINGTON, VA -- Today, McCain-Palin 2008 released its latest web ad, entitled "Preconditions." The ad highlights that while Barack Obama has pledged to meet with Iran and other state sponsors of terror without preconditions, Iran has outlined several preconditions of their own. For a meeting, Iran is demanding that the United States cease its support of Israel and that all American forces must leave the Middle East. The question is what will Barack Obama do?
 Remember when Barack Obama said he'd sit down and talk with Iran without preconditions?
 Would you be willing to meet separately without precondition within the first year of your administration in Washington or anywhere else with the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea?
 Senator Obama?
 I would.
 Maybe Obama doesn't have preconditions but Iran does.
Iran, whose President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said "Israel must be wiped off the map."
Iran demands:
That the U.S. must cease its support of Israel.
And that all U.S. military forces must leave the Middle East.
Meaning we abandon Iraq, Turkey and Kuwait.
What will Obama do?
Will he admit he was wrong or will he accept Iran's demands?
Tough question.
