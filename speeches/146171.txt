Good afternoon from the White House (where the Christmas Tree is arriving right now). Your pooler has been tested and is waiting for the remarks of Vice President Harris on COVID equity in the South Court Auditorium. The event is supposed to start at 3:30 p.m. The VP's remarks will be live-streamed at WhiteHouse.gov/live.
