Dear Mr. ______________:
Executive Order 9809, signed on December 12, 1946, was issued for the purpose of consolidating certain wartime agencies and functions.
By the terms of that Order, the functions of Section 5 of the War Labor Disputes Act, relating to wages or other terms and conditions of employment in plants or mines in possession of the Government, are to be administered by a special board to be constituted as may be necessary by the Secretary of Labor from among members of a panel to be appointed by the President. You are hereby appointed as a member of this panel.
I hope you will find it possible to serve as a member of a special board if the Secretary of Labor finds it necessary to call upon you.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
