Walking back and forth on the platform with mic in his hands, Biden delivered a rallying cry for the legislation with several rounds of applause.

He also vowed to ban the sale of assault weapons.

POTUS emerged from the center at 7:22 and answered a few questions.
Asked whether Ukraine has reached a turning point in the war:
"The question is unanswerable. It's hard to tell. It's clear the Ukrainians have made significant progress. But it's going to be a long haul."
Asked about the stock market:
"The stock market doesn't necessarily reflect the state of the economy, as you all know," he said. The economy is still strong, unemployment is low."

"No, I'm not," he said. "We're talking one tenth of one percent."
