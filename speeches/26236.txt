Mr. President and distinguished guests:
We're delighted that you could come here and give us some of your time on your visit to the United States.
You have held the President's chair now for 2 years. The long logbook of Bolivia's progress speaks for the sureness and for the strength of your hand. It shows the new course that you have set, and the new horizons that you have opened for your own People:

--political and social stability to speed your development plans;

--economic integration with LAFTA [Latin American Free Trade Association] and the Andean Group, to increase your growth opportunities;

--physical integration with your neighbors, to share in the benefits of such projects as the Bolivian highway and the River Plata Basin;

--and now you look forward to the day when a pipeline carries Bolivian gas into Argentina.
We, in America, share the pride and the happiness that your people find in these achievements. We admire and support your determination to press forward with creative change, to keep firm hold of the democratic process that is really the lifeline of those who work for a better day.
In that pursuit, Mr. President, United States support will be gladly given. I hope that our countries are always as close as they are today. I hope their presidents always feel as simpatico as we do today. I hope that when your people are represented on our soil by Bolivian participation in Hemis-Fair that you will enjoy what you see there and that your visit will be a pleasant and a profitable One.
We're so proud that you could be educated and trained some in our State. We're proud of the record that you're making in your country. I hope to some day be able to come there and see you in your own land, in your own atmosphere. We are grateful for the impressive gesture of good will and partnership that you have extended to us.
My friends and my family, please join me in a toast now to the brave and beautiful Republic of Bolivia--and to the proud and distinguished leader of a great people, President Barrientos.
