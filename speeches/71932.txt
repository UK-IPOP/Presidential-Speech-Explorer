 Mr. President, is there anything new on the crash, sir? Has the Pentagon radar or satellite imagery been able to yield any clues as to what happened to EgyptAir 990?
 Nothing that I've been briefed on.
 Mr. Chairman, what would you like the President to do to be helpful to your aspirations, as you put it?
 Not to forget that first agreement which had been started here in Oslo had been signed under his supervision in the White House. We cannot forget it.
