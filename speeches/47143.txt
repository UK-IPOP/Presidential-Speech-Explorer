 The Administration opposes enactment of H.J. Res. 683, which would extend the cooling-off period between the parties for 60 days, and would have the National Mediation Board appoint a three-member panel to report to the Congress within 50 days on the progress of negotiations, together with a proposal for resolution of the dispute. It is inappropriate for the Federal Government to intervene in a purely local railway labor dispute that does not affect the national rail system.

 The Administration has no objection to enactment of H.J. Res. 683.

 No position. Remain silent.
