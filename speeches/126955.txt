I am honored that so many legislators and Vermont leaders are standing behind the candidate that can win in November: Marco Rubio. Marco offers a positive vision for the future of America and in the White House, he will work every day to grow and expand opportunity which is why I will be voting for him on Tuesday.
Marco Rubio offers so much optimism and understands that America is an exceptional nation, much like Ronald Reagan did.Â I'm proud to join with these individuals in supporting him for President, and I know that we will all be encouraging our constituents, neighbors and friends to cast their ballot for Marco on March 1.
