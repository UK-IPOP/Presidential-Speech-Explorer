THE ACTION of the House of Representatives today in passing the Philippines War Damage Bill is a reaffirmation of the United States intention to honor a long-standing moral commitment to the Philippine people. It corrects the record of last May when, partly through a misunderstanding of the issues involved, an earlier version of this bill was defeated. I congratulate the House of Representatives for taking this action designed to clarify our relations with our Philippine friends and allies. I hope the Senate will soon act favorably on this important legislation.
