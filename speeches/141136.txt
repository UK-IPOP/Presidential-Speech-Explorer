It's easy to see why even Democrats say that Joe Biden's campaign is actively "suppressing the Hispanic vote." A growing number of Latinos are not buying what Biden and the Democrat Party are selling. Public polls are often flawed, but the trend is clear: President Trump is outperforming with Hispanic Americans while Joe Biden is flat-lining.
Biden's far-left policies — like massive tax increases and attacks on charter schools — are clearly turning off Hispanics.
Out-of-touch liberal pundits may be perplexed by Hispanics' lack of enthusiasm for Joe Biden, but we're not.
In addition to Biden's bad policies, his culturally incompetent campaign continues to alienate Hispanics by 
 on our communities, peddling victimhood, and extreme positions on abortion and other issues—all of which run afoul of Hispanic culture and values.
Joe Biden may count on celebrities to bolster his candidacy, but our Latinos for Trump coalition is building genuine relationships with Hispanic grassroots, community, business, and religious leaders across the country. Come November 3, our diverse coalition will play a key role in sending Biden back to his basement.
