More than 60 federal, state and local officials joined Gov. Nathan Deal at the Georgia State Capitol today to endorse former House Speaker and Georgia Congressman Newt Gingrich for the Republican nomination for President of the United States. 


At a press conference hosted by Deal at the North Steps of the Capitol, the officials joined business leaders and grassroots supporters to call on Georgians to vote for Gingrich in the upcoming Republican Presidential Preference Primary to be held on "Super Tuesday" â€” March 6, 2012.

"With this contest less than 90 days away, we wanted to throw our support behind the 
candidate we see qualified to take on Barack Obama and turn this nation around," said Senate President Pro Tempore Tommie Williams (R-Lyons). "Hands down that person is Newt Gingrich."

State Senator Barry Loudermilk (R-Cartersville) was among 33 members of the Georgia Legislature offering an endorsement today.

"We need a president who makes creating jobs his first priority," Loudermilk said. "Newt Gingrich has a record of turning around the economy. And he will return many powers back to the states, something Georgians desperately want to see in a president."

Among the state and local officials announcing they are endorsing Newt Gingrich today are:
