Today in Charleston, SC, Hillary Clinton will announce her agenda to fight discrimination as President and to restore the federal government's historic role as a champion of civil rights. She will focus on renewing and strengthening the Department of Justice's civil rights mission. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the creation of the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice. It also marks the seventh year of a concerted effort by the Bush Administration to turn the Civil Rights Division away from its historical mission and its traditions of professionalism, and toward an agenda driven by partisanship, cronyism, and ideology. As President, Hillary Clinton will take five specific steps to undo the damage done under President Bush and Attorney Generals Gonzales and Ashcroft, to advance civil rights, and to end discrimination.

 The Attorney General reversed a decades-old DOJ policy by eliminating non-partisan hiring panels and letting political appointees run the hiring process. These appointees chose Bush partisans over real professionals. The percentage of new hires with civil rights experience was cut almost in half from 77% to 42%. [Boston Globe, July 23, 2006.] A senior Bush official in the division boasted to friends about hiring Republicans to supposedly even things out. [Wall Street Journal, Aug. 28, 2007.] And to date, four career section chiefs have resigned (including a 35-year veteran responsible for enforcing Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act), along with two deputy chiefs, and 15 out of 35 attorneys in the voting rights section. [LCCR Education Fund Report, Sept. 2007; McClatchy, May 6, 2007.]
 Over a five-year period from 2001 to 2006, not a single voting discrimination case was brought on behalf of an African-American or Native-American voter. Instead, over the objections of career staff, political appointees supported "anti-voter fraud" efforts that place additional burdens on poor and minority voters, including a Georgia provision twice enjoined by a federal court for creating illegal barriers to voting. U.S. Attorneys across the country were reportedly pressured to pursue voting fraud cases that implicated Democrats or likely Democratic voters and U.S. Attorneys Iglesias and McKay were fired after they found insufficient merit to pursue the allegations. [LCCR Senate Testimony, June 21, 2007; Boston Globe, May 6, 2007; Washington Post, May 14, 2007.]
 In the past six years, DOJ reportedly filed the same number of Title VII cases that the Clinton administration filed in its first two years. [LCCR Senate Testimony, June 21, 2007.] And the number of race-based housing discrimination cases has fallen by more than half. [Leadership Conference on Civil Rights Education Fund Report, Sept. 2007.]
 The number of positions has not grown since President Bush took office. Under President Clinton, the Civil Rights Division's staff grew by 40% – more than 200 officials and attorneys.
Hillary Clinton will restore the Civil Rights Division's political independence, professional pride, and traditional priorities. She will:
 This past June, the Supreme Court placed severe restrictions on the voluntary efforts of local communities around the country to pursue greater racial equality in education. Four conservative Justices voted to slam the door shut on any meaningful local program designed for this important purpose. A fifth Justice, Justice Kennedy, rejected the voluntary plans of Seattle and Louisville and placed tight constraints on any school district seeking to take steps to redeem the promise of 
 But he did not bar these efforts outright. So today, local school districts around the country can choose to implement voluntary programs, but they have to tread very carefully to meet new standards. Hillary believes that the majority was simply wrong in this case. And when she is President, she will appoint Justices who understand the meaning of Brown and the meaning of the Equal Protection Clause. As President, she will also take concrete steps to help local school districts meet the tougher standards imposed by Justice Kennedy and continue their laudable efforts to promote voluntary integration. Specifically, she will:
 Hillary believes that voting is the most precious right of every citizen and that we have a moral obligation to ensure the integrity of our voting process and to guarantee all Americans a meaningful right to vote. She believes that the greatest democracy in the world should have a voting system that builds, not undermines, faith in our elections. As Senator, Hillary authored the Count Every Vote Act – called the gold standard of election reform bills – to address the problems that Americans, especially minorities and low-income voters, experienced in trying to vote and have their votes counted in past elections. As President, she will:
 Many young minority workers continue to face discriminatory treatment in the labor market. In a recent study, employers were twice as likely to hire a similarly qualified white applicant rather than a black applicant, and even hired white applicants with criminal records at the same or higher rates than black applicants without. [Pager and Western, Race at Work, 2007.] This discrimination offends the Constitution and undermines the notion of economic opportunity for all Americans. Unfortunately, the Bush Administration has failed to effectively enforce our employment discrimination laws. The Administration has sapped morale and resources from the employment section of the Civil Rights Division, advocated a restrictive interpretation of Title VII in a recent Supreme Court case, and cut the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's workforce by 20%. To reverse this trend, Hillary will:
 The hate crimes law currently on the books authorizes federal prosecution of those who use force or the threat of force to injure or intimidate a person (1) because of that person's race, religion, or national origin; and (2) because he or she has been attempting to engage in a federally protected activity, such as voting, attending court, or going to school. Most states also have hate crimes laws. As Senator, Hillary has consistently supported legislation to strengthen America's hate crimes law. President Bush has threatened to veto this legislation, should it pass the Senate. As President, Hillary will sign into law the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which:
