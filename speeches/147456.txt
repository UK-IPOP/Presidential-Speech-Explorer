VP arrived at the U.S. Conference of Mayors at the Peppermill Hotel Resort at 11:50 a.m. A contingent of protesters seeking more affordable housing greeted the motorcade. One large banner read "Housing not handcuffs" and another "Decriminalize poverty."
VP began speaking at 12:51 p.m. in the Tuscany Ballroom at the Peppermill Hotel Resort and spoke for about 20 minutes about how mayors are on the front lines and gave an impassioned plea for "common sense gun safety laws" to renew the assault weapon ban, expand background checks, repeal shield laws for gun manufacturers and pass red flag laws. Applause and laughter sprinkled the address with a standing ovation at one point.
