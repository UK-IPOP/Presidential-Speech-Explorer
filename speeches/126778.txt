WEST CHESTER TWP. â€“ Republicans in Butler County honored former Speaker John Boehner three days before residents across Ohio's 8th District will vote on his replacement in Congress.
But on Saturday, Boehner was more interested in talking about the presidential race.
In fact, the former speaker told a crowded ballroom in the same township he already voted for Kasich.
"He's my friend," said Boehner.
