Pool Reports by 
, 
Greetings from yet another brilliant day in Washington, a rare spell of late spring in June.
Your pooler is here to inform you that the press briefing has been pushed back a half hour to 1500.
If there are further changes to the schedule, you can count on finding out about them here.

Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre stepped down from the podium at 1615.
The White House press office announced a lid for the night at 1636.
It has been my pleasure serving as your print in-town pooler for the day. Enjoy the rest of the warm but not hot, dryish afternoon.
