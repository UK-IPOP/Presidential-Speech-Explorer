 "Giuliani on the Line-Item Veto... This guy is no judicial conservative. I don't agree with him on gun control or the commuter tax or the 1996 welfare reform, but what's more troubling is that he went to court to get the policy he wanted each and every time. He says he's a 'strict constructionist' now, but again and again he has invited judges to be activist. And he hasn't repudiated any of that record."

 "... [Giuliani] also fought and defeated the Republican Congress: the Line Item Veto Act was one of only two items in the Contract with America that it actually passed." (Terry Eastland, "Giuliani And Judicial Supremacy,"

 "It's understandable that Romney would look for something [like the line-item veto] that would cut against that. It suggests a little chink in Giuliani's armor." (Janet Hook, "Republicans Draw Line On Veto Power,"

 "I am flabbergasted that Giuliani devoted so much energy at a GOP debate to attacking an idea traditionally associated with Republican fiscal conservatism, and personally with Reagan." (John Hood, "Re: Giuliani's Puzzling Mistake,"
