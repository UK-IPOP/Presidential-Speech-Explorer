Supporters are flocking to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign web site at an historic rate, further demonstrating the groundswell of enthusiasm generated by her candidacy. Specifically, some 140,000 supporters have signed up as supporters through the campaign web site, 
 in the last five days alone.
"The online response has been overwhelming," Clinton Internet Director Peter Daou said. "140,000 people have signed up since we launched, including nearly a hundred thousand who signed up in the first 48 hours. Senator Clinton's three consecutive live web conversations were attended by tens of thousands of viewers who asked more than 25,000 questions."
