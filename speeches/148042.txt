Building on President Biden's historic announcements last week to use the Defense Production Act to boost American manufacturing of clean energy technologies and to make charging electric vehicles affordable and accessible for everyone, this week the Biden-Harris Administration announced new actions to lower energy costs for American families, protect frontline communities from dangerous water pollution, and secured new commitments from international partners to achieve energy and food security while tackling the climate crisis.
President Biden's latest actions received widespread press coverage and praise from Members of Congress, climate and environmental organizations, and more:

President Joe Biden's Department of Energy on Monday will propose a new rule to make residential, natural gas furnaces more energy-efficient. 
 Last week, Biden invoked the Defense Production Act to speed up domestic manufacturing of heat pumps, among other things, an action that will still require funding from Congress. Senior White House officials will meet with lawmakers this week to talk about two bills that would help fund heat pump manufacturing in the United States.

Advocates for more efficiency described the Biden administration's proposal as a big deal. "This is the first meaningful update in about 30 years," said Joanna Mauer, technical advocacy manager at the Appliance Standards Awareness Project. "This is a big deal for climate and consumers, [it] would 
 that's been available for a long time," Mauer said.

In an effort to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate change, the Department of Energy (DOE) on Monday proposed new energy-efficiency standards for residential gas furnaces. The rule, if finalized, would help limit the release of carbon dioxide and methane. 
 DOE estimates that this efficiency improvement, and the resulting lower gas bills, would save consumers $1.9 billion annually — or $500 over the lifetime of each new furnace.
"This proposal is a smart, commonsense way to reduce energy costs for American families and we applaud the Biden Administration for taking every action possible to lower home energy bills. By updating these efficiency standards, Americans not only stand to save more than $1.9 billion every year, but also stand to benefit from substantial cuts to dangerous greenhouse gas pollution that puts an enormous burden on both our climate and public health. This is a giant leap toward more affordable energy and cleaner, safer air for all." [

"Energy efficiency saves money, protects our climate, and helps cut off funding for Putin's war machine. @ENERGY took an important step today and I applaud them for following my 500 Day Plan to Energy Independence by prioritizing domestic manufacturing of heat pumps. I urge the administration to focus on bringing clean and affordable heat pumps to American consumers so we can lay the groundwork for an equitable clean energy future." [
, 6/13/22]
 "I led a letter to @ENERGY calling for updates to appliance efficiency standards to keep energy costs down for working families & reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Glad to see this proposal from the admin that will help build a more sustainable & prosperous future." [
, 6/13/22]
 "At a time when global gas markets are in turmoil, this is a good step to help protect millions of families against price spikes that can send bills through the roof. We're one big step closer to finally moving past outdated furnace technology. The administration deserves kudos for stepping up with a strong proposal here. Now they'll need to move promptly and get the job done." [
, 6/13/22]
 "Home heating bills strain the budgets of many households, especially those with low incomes, yet we're still installing brand-new furnace models that waste a lot of the heat. The Biden administration is right to phase out the most inefficient models. We've had far-more-efficient options available for years now. The new standard would reduce needless costs and greenhouse gas emissions." [
, 6/13/22]
 "Today, national consumer groups hailed the release of the Department of Energy's proposal to increase energy efficiency standards for residential furnaces as a crucial step toward saving consumers at least $30.3 billion on their energy bills. The Consumer Federation of America, National Consumer Law Center, and Consumer Reports, upon initial review, are in support of the Biden Administration's proposed rule which will benefit the vast majority of consumers who currently have outdated, inefficient gas furnaces. The rule will save consumers money on electricity bills, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change." [
, 6/13/22]
 "Although the harm done to consumers through years of inaction and stonewalling by the gas utilities on this standard cannot be undone, by adopting a higher standard today, future harm can be prevented. We will urge the Department to move with all due speed to finalize a long overdue, much-needed standard that does away with inefficient, energy-wasting furnaces so that consumers will pay less on their energy bills."

The Biden administration said it is about to start rolling out the first billion dollars from last year's infrastructure bill to reduce drinking-water contamination from "forever chemicals," and it is issuing new warnings that the toxic substances may harm people at levels currently too low to detect. As part of Wednesday's announcement, the Environmental Protection Agency said it is also issuing updated health advisories based on new science on PFAS and that guidance is for a full lifetime of exposure.
[Matthew Daly, 6/15/22]
The EPA on Wednesday issued nonbinding health advisories that set health risk thresholds for PFOA and PFOS to near zero, replacing 2016 guidelines that had set them at 70 parts per trillion. At the same time, the agency is 
. Money can be used for technical assistance, water quality testing, contractor training and installation of centralized treatment, officials said.

"Forever chemicals," a nickname for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), are a class of toxic chemicals that have been linked to illnesses including testicular and kidney cancers and thyroid disease. A Biden administration official told reporters on Tuesday night that the agency was lowering its health advisory — meant to inform the public about how much is considered safe to drink — for the two most notorious types of PFAS, known as PFOA and PFOS to "near zero" in new interim advisories.
 
[Keith Matheny, 6/15/22]
The updated advisory levels, which are based on new science and consider lifetime exposure, indicate that some negative health effects may occur with concentrations of PFOA or PFOS in water that are near zero and below (the) EPA's ability to detect at this time," agency officials said in a release.
 The EPA's action was welcomed by Anthony Spaniola, a Troy attorney whose family has for decades owned frontage property on PFAS-tainted Van Etten Lake near the former Wurtsmith Air Force base in Oscoda, who has become an outspoken critic of the Air Force's response to the contamination.
 "The science is clear that toxic PFAS chemicals pose a severe, demonstrated health risk to our communities, and are an urgent public health threat. I appreciate EPA's ongoing work to acknowledge the dangers of exposure to these 'forever chemicals' that are contaminating our water, especially their dedication to allocating resources to disadvantaged communities facing challenges with emerging contaminants." [
, 6/15/22]
"Today's decision underscores just how dangerous PFAS 'forever chemicals' are for local communities, including our service members, civilian personnel, and their families … I am pleased that the Biden-Harris administration has taken full advantage of resources made available by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to support a whole-of-government response to the PFAS challenge." [
, 6/15/22]
We must reckon with the lasting damage of 'forever chemicals.' The EPA is right to strengthen health advisories for PFAS & provide communities with funding, made possible by the bipartisan infrastructure law, to address these contaminants in drinking water." [
, 6/16/22]
Every household should have confidence in the safety of the water coming out of their tap ... These new health advisories announced by the EPA are an early step in a critical process to develop national drinking water standards for several of the most prevalent types of PFAS." [
, 6/15/22]
"The federal funds headed home to address dangerous PFAS exposure in our drinking water is another important example of the bipartisan infrastructure law working for Granite Staters. PFAS can cause severe health issues, and we must address PFAS contamination in our water supply, which is why we prioritized these investments in the bipartisan infrastructure law that will now lead to real progress for our communities." [Press Release, 6/15/22]
 "Huge thank you to @EPA and the Biden administration for taking these important steps to protect our health from dangerous #PFAS chemicals. We hope they keep going and move quickly to protect our communities from the full class of toxic PFAS chemicals." [
, 6/15/22]
 PFAS are dangerous "forever chemicals" used in everyday products like cookware & clothing that are linked to many health problems. Today's health advisory from @EPA is a good first step, now, let's get PFAS out of our water for good!" [
, 6/15/22]
 "We have to fight for what we love, our children, and a cleaner, safer, more livable planet for them and all the life systems of creation. Stopping forever chemicals and getting them out of the water, land, and air is a priority. This is a significant step in the right direction." [
, 6/16/22]
"Today, Biden's EPA restored our faith in humanity. These 'forever chemicals' are toxic at trace amounts. We knew it five years ago when our friends were getting sick and dying. There's still a lot of work needed before our community can heal and we plan to keep holding the EPA accountable." [
, 6/15/22]
 "The EPA had the courage to follow the science, something we've been demanding for years. This is a step in the right direction." [Statement, 6/15/22]

During their trip to Pittsburgh, they will provide an update on the bipartisan Infrastructure law passed in November, including an allocation of $15 billion toward the removal and replacement of lead service lines. Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority began removing and replacing lead water lines in 2016 after it identified high levels of lead in the water systems. In 2019, the company started adding orthophosphate into the drinking water supply to reduce the lead that was leaching out of the pipes into the water. As of June, PWSA had replaced about 9,100 public and 6,000 private lead service lines using a combination of federal and state funding.
