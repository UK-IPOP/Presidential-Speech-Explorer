THE APPROACH of Lincoln's birthday reminds us that the final vestiges of intolerance and hatred must be eliminated from our land. This is a challenge to all of us-in our States, in our communities, in our homes, and most of all in the depths of our hearts. The Community Relations Service will help to meet that challenge in its quiet but determined way, through conciliation and cooperation, by reason and by understanding. Its aim is to achieve peaceful progress in civil rights.
