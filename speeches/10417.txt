My dear Mr. Dale:
I have your encouraging letter of March 9th. As an indication of my feeling toward a community that shows the stamina which Curwensville has displayed, I have today given copies of it to the press.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[J. Thomas Dale, Secretary, Chamber of Commerce, Curwensville, Pennsylvania]
