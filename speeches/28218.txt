EARLIER this month Director J. Edgar Hoover of the Federal Bureau of Investigation addressed an open letter to college students in which he outlined the tactics used by extremists in their effort to promote their schemes on campus. Mr. Hoover's letter is a cogent and enlightening analysis of the strategy these extremists employ as they attempt to trick college students into support of lawlessness, disruption and violence.
This letter impressed me as a worthy companion piece to the article by Professor Sidney Hook,
 which I sent to you recently. In view of your deep and continuing interest in these problems, I am sending you a copy of the letter. I hope that you will make every effort to see that the message it contains will reach as many students as possible.

With my best wishes,

Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
