ARLINGTON, VA -- Today, McCain-Palin 2008 released its latest television ad, entitled "Hypo." The ad highlights Barack Obama's practice of calling every question about his record a lie while he launches false and misleading attacks against John McCain. That is the type of hypocrisy we expect to see at tonight's debate in Nashville. The ad will be televised nationally. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 "A new Obama ad characterizes the 'Bush-McCain privatization plan' as 'cutting Social Security Benefits in half.' This is a falsehood sure to frighten seniors who rely on their Social Security checks. In truth, McCain does not propose to cut those checks at all."

 "An Obama-Biden ad falsely claims McCain says he wants to 'do the same to our health care' that 'Wall Street deregulation' has done to the banking industry. ... Obama used this misleading accusation on the campaign trail over the weekend." ("Out Of Context On Health Care," FactCheck.org,

 "Thus, when Obama's radio ad says, 'John McCain has stood in the way ... he's opposed stem cell research,' it is misleading voters by not pointing out that McCain changed his mind on the issue seven years ago and currently supports stem cell research. The ad cleverly uses the word 'has' to imply that McCain still opposes the research -- which is not true."
