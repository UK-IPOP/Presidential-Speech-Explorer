The Senator, campaigning today in Michigan, issued a statement denying the use of notes. His press representative, Pierre Salinger, said Senator Kennedy had with him in the studio last night a photostat of the Eisenhower letter (regarding U.S. treaty commitments in the Taiwan Strait), a photostat of a page from a book by Matthew B. Ridgway, retired Army Chief of Staff, and a quotation from the late Secretary of State John Foster Dulles.
"If the President is to be quoted in a matter involving our security," Senator Kennedy said in his statement, "he should be quoted accurately."
Moreover, Mr. Salinger said, he knew of no agreement barring the use of notes during the debates.
