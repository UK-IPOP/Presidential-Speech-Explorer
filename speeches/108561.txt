Mitt Romney today announced the endorsements of Speaker Designate Will Weatherford (R-Wesley Chapel), Representative Chris Dorworth (R- Lake Mary) and Representative Richard Corcoran (R-Trinity).
"I am honored to have the support of Representatives Weatherford, Dorworth and Corcoran," said Mitt Romney. "They are the current and future leaders of the Republican Party in Florida. As I visit the state and reach out to voters, I look forward to working with these leaders to fix our economy and bring jobs back to Florida. They share my pro-growth agenda and with their help, we can defeat President Obama in 2012."
Announcing his support, Speaker Designate Weatherford said, "I am proud to get behind Mitt Romney in this election. He has the vision and experience that will be necessary to put our country back on the right path. President Obama's policies are creating uncertainty and killing jobs in this country. With millions of Americans unemployed, Florida voters are looking for a candidate who will be able to turn this economy around."
All three members had previously endorsed Governor Tim Pawlenty. Pawlenty has also endorsed Mitt Romney for President.
