"President Obama's response to even more bad economic news is a massive tax increase. It just proves again that the President doesn't have a clue how to get America working again and help the middle class. The President's latest bad idea is to raise taxes on families, job creators, and small businesses. Almost half a million fewer Americans are working today than the day Barack Obama took office, and we've just come through the worst job creation quarter in two years. Unlike President Obama, Governor Romney understands that the last thing we need to do in this economy is raise taxes on anyone. He has a plan to permanently lower marginal rates, help middle-class Americans save and invest, and jumpstart economic growth and job creation." —Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson

 "Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad (D-N.D.), a member of the Gang of Six, said in an interview that it "might make some sense" to extend all the taxes in the short term if lawmakers need more time to fundamentally reform the current corporate and individual tax system.

'I'm going to vote to extend them,' the Utah Democrat said. 'In a tough economy, you want to be careful about significantly reducing spending or increasing taxes.' Matheson's position puts him at odds with President Barack Obama." (Robert Gehrke, "Matheson Backes Extending Bush Tax Cuts,

 OBAMA: "So he is absolutely right, the last thing you want to do is to raise taxes in the middle of a recession because that would just suck up — take more demand out of the economy and put businesses in a further hole." ("Obama: We Must 'Help Elkhart Reinvent Itself',"

 OBAMA: "Normally, you don't raise taxes in a recession, which is why we haven't and why we have instead cut taxes. So I guess what I would say to Scott is his economics are right, you don't raise taxes in a recession. We haven't raised taxes in a recession." ("Obama: We Must 'Help Elkhart Reinvent Itself',"
