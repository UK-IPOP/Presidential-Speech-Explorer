THE PRESIDENT is delighted that Prince Sihanouk has agreed to release the 12 Americans who have been detained in Cambodia. He greatly appreciates the excellent treatment which has been accorded the men from the LCU 1577 since their detention, and the medical care given the wounded helicopter crewman who has been in Cambodian custody since November 28. The other 11 have been in custody since their landing craft entered Cambodian waters on July 17.
This Government believes that the release of the men will contribute significantly to improvement in the atmosphere of relations between Cambodia and the United States.
