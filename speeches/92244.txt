 Today, the Romney for President Campaign announced that Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) has endorsed Governor Mitt Romney. Along with his fellow Texans Congressman Mike Conaway (R-TX) and former Congressman Henry Bonilla (R-TX), Congressman Smith will advise Governor Romney's national campaign and will help communicate his message of conservative change in Washington.
"I am proud to have the endorsement of one of the finest members of the House of Representatives. Congressman Smith has served his community, state and nation with honor and steadfast leadership. For decades, he has been a powerful voice in Congress on judiciary issues, crime and immigration. I am grateful to have his counsel in this campaign," said Governor Romney.
Announcing his support for Governor Romney, Congressman Smith said, "Governor Romney is the only candidate in this race who has the ability to take Washington apart and put it back together, so that it works better for the American people. I am happy to endorse his candidacy for President. He understands the importance of getting America back to conservative principles and common sense leadership. Governor Romney is the right choice for Americans who want to see change in Washington."
 Congressman Smith has shaped American public policy and left his imprint on national politics through a variety of leadership positions and by advancing dozens of pieces of key legislation. As the Ranking Republican Member of the House Judiciary Committee, he serves as a spokesman for the party and helps shape committee policy. Representative Smith has been Chairman of three of the Judiciary Committee's five subcommittees: Intellectual Property, Crime, and Immigration. He was also selected to serve on both the Homeland Security Committee and the Science and Technology Committee. Congressman Smith previously served as Chairman of the Ethics Committee and currently is the Ranking Republican on the Ethics Task Force.
