My dear Mr. Secretary:
I have your letter of today's date tendering your resignation as Secretary of Labor which I must, of course, accept, to be effective at noon on December 2nd.
I wish to take this occasion to express the great appreciation I have, and that I know the American people have, for the manner in which you have conducted the Department of Labor for a period of nearly ten years.
From my association with you, both as a fellow Cabinet member and as President, I know the sterling service you have performed on behalf of the wage earners of our country. It represents a long period of successful public service and I regard it as fortunate indeed that the country is still to retain your service in the Senate. With your long experience and your knowledge of the problems of labor and of government, it cannot but be fruitful of great public good.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Hon. James J. Davis, Secretary of Labor, Washington, D.C. ]
