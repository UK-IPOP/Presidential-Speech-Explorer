 Mr. President, how is it going? Mr. President?
 How long is it going to take, Mr. President?
 We pledged to each other we would answer no questions and offer no comment, and I'd like to set a good example. [

 Can you resist us, sir?
 It's difficult to resist, but I will make itâ€”today, at least.
 Is that the only agreement you have reached so far? [

 That would be answering a question. [
] Thank you.
