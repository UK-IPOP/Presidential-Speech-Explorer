 (Pres. Bill Clinton, Hillary For President Campaign Event, Bow, NH, 1/5/08)
 
 PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON: "Thirdly, I think the humane thing to do here is to give the people that are here and are working and have no law problems, except that they're not here legally, 
. You know, the vast majority of these people are completely law abiding, and they pay taxes, even, but they're not here lawfully. ... I talk to people, you know, and I try to figure out what's going on. I think that is the fairer system. It's also consistent with the bill that Senator McCain supported in the Senate. I think it's the right thing to do, and so does Hillary." (Pres. Bill Clinton, Hillary For President Campaign Event, Bow, NH, 1/5/08)
 QUESTION: "But fundamentally, don't you still have the same plan for a path to citizenship that you fundamentally held months ago?" MCCAIN: "Sure." (ABC/WMUR, [Unverified Transcript], Republican Presidential Candidate Debate, Manchester, NH, 1/5/08)
