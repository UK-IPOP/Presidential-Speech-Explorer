Dear Mr. Cummings:
It is most gratifying to my associates and me to have your account of satisfactory dealings with the Small Business Administration. I shall see that Administrator Barnes knows of your approval.
Thank you very much for this piece of evidence that our endeavors to be helpful to small business have met with some success.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
