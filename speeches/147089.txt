There are six Operation Fly Formula flights currently scheduled for the week of July 11, projected to import approximately 8 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of infant formula to the United States. By July 17, Operation Fly Formula flights will have completed 48 flights and imported more than 55 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of infant formula.
Additionally, the following three flights were confirmed after last week's news release was issued and delivered more than 3.5 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of infant formula. These deliveries are included in the end of the week calculations.
Under Operation Fly Formula, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the General Services Administration (GSA) are partnering to import infant formula from other nations that meets U.S. health and safety standards, so it can get to store shelves faster.
