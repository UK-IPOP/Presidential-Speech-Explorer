To Her Majesty Elizabeth Queen of Great Britain:
In August 1858 President Buchanan exchanged greetings with Queen Victoria by means of the newly completed Atlantic cable. Commemorating that happy occasion, it is a pleasure to send best wishes to you on the one hundredth anniversary of the completion of the first Trans-Atlantic Cable.
The development of international communications has brought the peoples of the world into close neighborhood. It is our hope that these means of communication will serve increasingly as a carrier of the message of peace for which we both work and pray.

With personal greetings to you and to your family.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
