Yesterday, the Biden-Harris Administration opened 
 and 
 for a special enrollment period until May 15 to provide all Americans the opportunity to sign up for health insurance coverage amid the pandemic. President Biden believes health care is a right and will do everything in his power to uphold his commitment to ensure all Americans have access to quality, affordable health care. After four years of attacks on Americans' health care and amid the pandemic, this special enrollment period will help Americans secure some peace of mind as we work to beat the pandemic and strengthen and build on the Affordable Care Act.
"Great news: Thanks to President Biden, starting today, you can go to 
 to sign up for health insurance. If you're uninsured or hoping to change plans, here's a good article that can help you figure out if you're eligible." [

President Biden is delivering on his health care promises. For four years, Republicans waged a war on America's health care. President Biden is doing the opposite. Thanks to the President's actions, millions of Americans will now be able to buy affordable quality health insurance for themselves and their families. This is so important during this pandemic, when millions have lost their job or can no longer afford their insurance and where every American is worried about their access to health care. The President's announcement of a $50 million marketing campaign will mean more Americans know that affordable health insurance is now within their reach. This move comes on the heels of a historic week for health care, where the House Democrats strengthened the already substantial health care provisions proposed by President Biden in the American Rescue Plan. It's clear President Biden and Democrats are using every tool at their disposal to build on the strong foundation of the Affordable Care Act to lower costs and expand coverage." [

 "Every American deserves access to affordable health coverage and high-quality care, and that is especially true during a pandemic. We appreciate the Biden Administration for providing this additional opportunity for hardworking American families to enroll in coverage for their health and financial security as they continue to fight to overcome the COVID-19 crisis. Timely and targeted solutions such as this special enrollment period are exactly what Americans need to support them through COVID-19. We appreciate this demonstration of strong public-private partnership, and we are committed to remaining a valuable private sector partner for the benefit of communities and families. Nearly 14 million Americans already get coverage through the individual market, and they appreciate the strong consumer protections provided by plans available through the marketplaces. Health insurance providers will support individuals and families with valuable information about coverage options – online, over the phone, and in many languages. Those who enroll in or change coverage during this SEP should be ready to update their financial information so they can find out whether they qualify for help. In fact, 
 who enrolled in the individual market last year received financial help. They also should have a list of their doctors and prescriptions ready so they can choose a plan that's right for them. Americans should also know that a change in their coverage status because of the loss of a job will qualify them for a special enrollment period at any time of the year. Health insurance providers continue to cover costs for COVID-19 diagnostic testing, treatment and vaccines, as well as costs for other medical services and prescription drugs, making coverage absolutely essential for Americans' health, financial stability and peace of mind." [Statement, 2/15/20]

: "This Special Enrollment Period will give all Americans a chance to enroll in health care coverage and get much needed financial assistance. We applaud President Biden's actions and his commitment to do the national outreach that is essential to fostering more enrollment. Leaning in to help those who are uninsured get the financial help they need to get covered has never been so critical." [
, 2/15/20]
 "Americans now have another opportunity to seek quality, affordable health care coverage. With increased outreach and education, we can help those who are uninsured understand their financial options and get them enrolled in health insurance. Now is not the time to be uninsured." [

"Americans have been hit hard by the pandemic. Now we have an opportunity to get more people insured at a time when we need it the most." [

"President Biden re-opened enrollment for health coverage to expand access for Americans in this health and economic crisis. We're working to quickly respond to the COVID crisis and pass the American Rescue Plan to deliver bold relief, lower costs, and expand coverage for all." [
, 2/15/20]
"Access to health care is a matter of life-or-death, as our nation has tragically seen during the devastation of the coronavirus pandemic and economic crisis. President Biden's actions to expand access to health care through the Affordable Care Act will be a lifeline for potentially millions during their time of need, protecting the health and financial security of those who have lost their health insurance through no fault of their own. At the same time, our House Committees are advancing and preparing to pass the Biden American Rescue Plan, which will take the action needed to defeat this pandemic, putting shots in people's arms, money in their pockets, children back to school and people back to work. With nearly half a million Americans having died, over 27 million having been infected and tens of millions without jobs, it is imperative that we send this legislation to President Biden's desk to be signed as soon as possible. Together with the Biden-Harris Administration, the Democratic Congress will continue our work to save lives and livelihoods, and to protect the right of all Americans to affordable, quality health care." [
, 2/15/20]
 "Starting today, millions of Americans without health coverage can log onto 
 and get covered through the special enrollment period launched by the Biden Administration. With the COVID-19 pandemic still placing Americans at risk of illness and hospitalization, it is essential that as many of our people are covered with quality, affordable health insurance. Democrats enacted the Affordable Care Act in 2010 in order to bring down costs and make health care more accessible to tens of millions of Americans. We have defended the law against Republican sabotage and efforts to repeal it, as well as a lawsuit that threatens to strip away coverage for those with pre-existing conditions in the middle of a deadly pandemic where those with certain underlying conditions are at greater risk. Last Congress, the House passed legislation to strengthen and expand the law's protections, and this Congress we will work with the Biden Administration to continue making sure that Americans are able to access high-quality and affordable health care even after this pandemic is finally brought to an end." [

: "The importance of health care coverage has never been clearer as millions of Americans are losing their jobs and health coverage due to this public health and economic crisis. I applaud President Biden's swift action to reopen the Marketplace so that Americans can sign up for quality, affordable health care. The Biden Administration is also conducting outreach and marketing so that people are aware of this special enrollment period. The HealthCare.gov Marketplace opens today and will remain open through May 15. I encourage everyone in need of health care coverage to check out their options." [

Last month, President Biden and Vice President Harris took a long overdue step to expand access to affordable health care during the COVID-19 pandemic by establishing a Special Enrollment Period for the 
 Marketplaces. Expanding access to health insurance plans through the 
is one of the best strategies we have to help people get covered during this global health emergency. Regrettably, the previous Administration refused to take this basic step to support uninsured and underinsured Americans, even as the number of COVID-19 cases grew rapidly. Now, as the virus continues to spread across the country, this Special Enrollment Period will provide millions of Americans and their families an opportunity to access the comprehensive health coverage they need to weather this pandemic. I encourage anyone who doesn't already have coverage to find and sign up for an affordable health insurance plan by visiting HealthCare.gov or calling 1-800-318-2596 from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021."
