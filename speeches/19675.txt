Your Majesty:
I wish to extend to you my deep sympathy, and that of the American people, on the death of your father, His Majesty, King Haakon VII.
His wisdom and his courage were a source of strength to the Allied peoples during World War II, as they have been to the people of Norway during his long reign.
I am certain that your reign will be marked by the same resolute and steadfast devotion to duty.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
