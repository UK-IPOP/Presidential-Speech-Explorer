 There are more than 180 highly-qualified nominees awaiting a fair vote in the Senate. Of these nominees, 30 have been waiting more than a year for a Senate vote, about half have been waiting 100 days or longer, and nine nominees have been waiting more than two years. The Senate's continued delay in confirming these nominees means good people are becoming increasingly discouraged from entering into public service.
 Many of America's courts are understaffed and overworked by too many vacancies while the Senate stands in the way of outstanding candidates who could relieve some of the burden. Eleven of the President's judicial nominees stand ready to take posts that have been declared judicial emergencies, yet the Senate has refused to give them an up-or-down vote.
 DOJ helps protect the public from the threat of terrorism and ensures the fair and partial administration of justice for all Americans, and the Senate has a responsibility to confirm the leaders charged with these tasks.
 Senate leaders have pledged to do all that they can to ensure the Government takes action on the economy, yet they refuse to confirm the very people waiting to advise the President on the best ways to keep our economy growing. After nearly six months of awaiting a confirmation hearing, Dennis Carlton withdrew his name from consideration in the Senate. Donald Marron, who was nominated last summer, is still awaiting confirmation after more than seven months.
 The Federal Reserve Board was established by Congress to ensure our country has a safe and stable financial system, yet in this time of economic uncertainty the Senate is standing in the way of respected experts who could help guide the Federal Reserve's critical decisions.
 The President appreciates the Senate Commerce Committee scheduling a hearing for nominee Bobby Sturgell in February, but it remains important that he and other nominees receive a swift up-or-down vote, rather than waiting for months after their hearing. Given the crucial role the FAA plays in ensuring the safety of the flying public, and at a time when air traffic congestion is a serious concern and Americans are experiencing record delays, it is irresponsible for the Senate to prevent a proven leader from taking on this public safety responsibility.
 President Bush has nominated qualified people to fill all three vacant spots on the Commission, yet two of his nominees have been waiting more than a year for a Senate hearing. These nominees need to be confirmed to enable the Mine Safety Commission to decide cases and penalize mines that commit safety violations.
 The NTSB is the lead investigator of any significant transportation accidents, such as the Minnesota bridge collapse. The President nominated two candidates for this Board last October, but the Senate has yet to give them an up-or-down vote.
 President Bush nominated two individuals to serve on this board more than six months ago. This independent Federal agency is responsible for investigation of industrial chemical accidents, and continual vacancies on the Board will inhibit its ability to respond effectively to crises as they arise.
 These positions oversee important programs that provide health care and social services to our children and seniors and protect the Nation's public health. Millions of Americans rely on these programs every day, and the Senate has a responsibility to take action and give them an up-or-down vote.
