ARLINGTON, VA -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today released the following statement by former U.S. Senator and presidential candidate Bob Dole in response to comments today by Naomi Wolf:
"This is a shameful attack on an America hero. John McCain has served his country with courage and honor. Tomorrow marks the 35th anniversary of John's release from the notorious 'Hanoi Hilton,' after being held for 5 1/2 years as a prisoner of war. For Ms. Wolf to challenge John McCain's integrity and commitment to his country is disgraceful. Ms. Wolf's comments illustrate the growing disconnect between anti-war extremists like MoveOn.org and the very real challenges of waging a war against radical Islamic extremism. John McCain understands these challenges. He has proven himself to his fellow POWs and he has proven himself to the American people."
