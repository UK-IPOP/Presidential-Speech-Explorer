Today, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Lisa Monaco concluded a series of meetings with French security officials to discuss way to strengthen counterterrorism cooperation in the wake of the tragic terrorist attacks in Paris earlier this month. During her meeting with French Minister of the Interior Bernard Cazeneuve, the two discussed opportunities to enhance strong and ongoing U.S.-French cooperation to disrupt terror plots and prevent future attacks. Ms. Monaco reviewed information from U.S. law enforcement and intelligence channels that has been shared with French authorities, and Minister Cazeneuve gave an overview of the attacks. Minister Cazeneuve thanked Ms. Monaco for unwavering U.S. support to France in the aftermath of the attacks, expressing appreciation for intelligence and law enforcement cooperation, President Obama's strong statements of support, calls to President Hollande on January 7 and 20, and the President's visit to the French Embassy in Washington, D.C. on January 8 immediately following the attack. Ms. Monaco reiterated that the United States will continue to support France in its investigation as French authorities work to identify, apprehend, and bring to justice those who helped plan or enable these attacks. They also discussed governmental responses in addressing the full life cycle of radicalization and programs to prevent violent extremism.
