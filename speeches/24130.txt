Dear Mr. Secretary:
I have read the memoranda on the recent management improvements made by the Coast Guard.
These improvements provide a clear example of how management of an organization, using modern techniques and imagination, can achieve simultaneously several objectives of this Administration. In this case, current operating costs were reduced, resources were made available for new programs, services to the public were improved, and a significant contribution to the balance of payments was made.
This sets a good example for all of us, particularly those who continue to insist that we cannot achieve more program results and maintain our pressure on reducing costs at the same time.
Please pass on to your associates in the Department and, in particular, to the Coast Guard, my commendation and appreciation for these achievements.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[ Honorable Henry H. Fowler, Secretary of the Treasury, Washington, D.C. 20220]
