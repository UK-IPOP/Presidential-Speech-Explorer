The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 3268. In many respects, this bill incorporates the major themes advanced by the Administration in its reauthorization proposal. H.R. 3268 would: (1) improve educational results for children by promoting their greater inclusion in the general curriculum, general assessments, and State and local reform efforts; (2) focus even more on teaching and learning by reducing paperwork and increasing administrative flexibility; and (3) provide families and teachers with the knowledge and training they need to support students' learning effectively. The Administration, however, has significant concerns about a number of the bill's provisions and will work to address the following and other concerns as the bill moves through Congress.
