?POTUS and FLOTUS arrived at the Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Georgetown at 5:31pm. They were greeted with some cheering from afar and walked right into the Church. Pool is holding.


?POTUS/FLOTUS, masked, left Church at 6:25pm to cheers from onlookers. They waved at a trio of young ladies standing on their stoop directly across the street (SS wanded them before POTUS came outside), which prompted some screams of delight.

Others came out of their homes as well, or stopped walking the street to see what was going on. One family peered out of their second floor windows, cell phones out, to check out the scene. Down the street from the Church, a small crowd had also gathered by the time mass ended.

We're rolling back to campus. 


We arrived back at the WH at 6:34pm and caught a brief glimpse of POTUS/FLOTUS walking inside.

Travel/photo lid called at 6:34pm. Have a great Saturday evening and rest of the weekend.
