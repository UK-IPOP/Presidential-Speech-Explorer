Your Holiness:
I want to take the occasion of Mr. Sargent Shriver's visit to extend to you my warmest greetings. I know that Mr. Shriver will find his conversation with you a source of great inspiration.
These days following your return from Jerusalem are hopeful ones for all men. Americans of every religion have been deeply impressed by the spirit of brotherhood demonstrated in your historic meetings with Pope Paul. I have also been long acquainted with your personal efforts to promote Christian ideals and principles, especially during your years of devoted service in the United States. May the spirit of peace and brotherhood to which you are making such a momentous contribution be an example for the entire world.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
