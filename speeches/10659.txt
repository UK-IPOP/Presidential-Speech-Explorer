I EXTEND to you and your co-workers my warmest congratulations upon the occasion of the dedication today of the new chapter house of the American Red Cross in New York City. From this fine edifice made possible by a gift from the Conrad Hubert fund I am sure that the fine record of a quarter of a century of service in New York City by your Red Cross Chapter will be carried on with increasingly great appreciation from your community.
HERBERT HOOVER
[General James G. Harbord, Chairman, New York Chapter, American Red Cross, 315 Lexington Avenue, New York City]
