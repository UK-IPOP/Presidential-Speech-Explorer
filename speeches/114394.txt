, 9/7/12)

, 9/6/12)
 "Political consultant David Gergen said on CNN that Obama 'lowered the bar' for the public's expectations of him. 'It's a different aura. It's a more dignified speech, but he's scarred. He's more mature and he's not promising as much,' said Gergen." (Kevin Cirilli, "TV Pundits Split On Obama Speech," 
, 9/6/12)

, 9/7/12)
 
 "And then President Obama got up and just sort of didn't do anything special. The president, that legendary orator, vaunted crowd-mover, well-known sweeper-away of audiences in general and political conventions in particular, gave a warmed-over rehash of his stump speech, right down to the exit music, Bruce Springsteen's 'We Take Care of Our Own,' that generally plays him out at campaign events."

, 9/6/12)

, 9/7/12)

, 9/7/12)
