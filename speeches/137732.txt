 Hello, folks. How are you? [

 Can I tell you, I'm hungry? I'm going to get my breakfast, but I will—[

 Thank you, folks. Do you know who this is? Does everybody know? He's going to be a fantastic Prime Minister, I can tell you. And we're having very, very good meetings. So far, so good.

 We're having terrific meetings. And we're going to do a fantastic deal once we clear up some of the obstacles in our path.

 And that's a fantastic—many deals. We're talking about many different deals, but we're having a good time. As far as U.K. and the United States, we're working on a very big trade deal, and I think it's going to work out very well.

So thank you very much. See you later. Thanks.
