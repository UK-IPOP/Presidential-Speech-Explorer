Mitt Romney today announced the support of elected officials and leaders in Delaware. Romney for President also submitted the signatures and paperwork required to appear on the Delaware Republican primary ballot. "I am happy to have the support of so many in Delaware," said Mitt Romney. "In order to win in November 2012, I will need their help as I spread my pro-growth message and reach out to voters in Delaware and across the country." Announcing his support, House Republican Leader Greg Lavelle said, "After three years of failed attempts to restart our economy, it is clear that the liberal policies of President Obama are not working. We need a president who has displayed conservative leadership and understands how our economy actually functions. Mitt Romney displayed this leadership as both a governor and successful businessman. With his economic know-how, we will be able to get our economy working again." "Mitt Romney has emerged as the only candidate with the experience and plan to take on President Obama," said RNC National Committeeman Laird Stabler. "He is a conservative businessman who was able to use those principles as governor to cut taxes and spending. I look forward to working with these other leaders from Delaware to help Mitt Romney defeat President Obama and reverse the economic stagnation of the last three years."
