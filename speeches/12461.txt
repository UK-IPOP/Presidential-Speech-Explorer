 November 11, 1937, is the nineteenth anniversary of the cessation of the most destructive, sanguinary, and far-reaching war in human annals; and
 Senate Concurrent Resolution 18, Sixty-ninth Congress (44 Stat. 1982), passed June 4, 1926, provides:
That the President of the United States is requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on November 11 and inviting the people of the United States to observe the day in schools and churches, or other suitable places, with appropriate ceremonies expressive of our gratitude for peace and our desire for the continuance of friendly relations with' all other peoples: and
 lawlessness and strife in many parts of the world which now threaten international security and even civilization itself, make it particularly fitting that we should again express our wish to pursue a policy of peace, to adopt every practicable means to avoid war, to work for the restoration of confidence and order among nations, and to repeat that the will to peace still characterizes the great majority of the peoples of the earth;
, President of the United States of America, do hereby direct that on November 11, 1937, the nineteenth anniversary of the Armistice, the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings, and do invite the people of the United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies in schools and churches, and other suitable places.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 22d day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-second.
