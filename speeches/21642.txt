Your Royal Highnesses, ladies and gentlemen:
We are privileged today to have as our honored guests Their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Liege. It is a peculiar privilege also to tell you people about one thing that I have learned here today. The Princess is a citizen of the United States by reason of the fact that she is a descendant of Lafayette.
I have been trying to persuade her to stay here until November 8th, and I am doing a little bit of electioneering to see her vote is on the right side.
However, it is a great honor to tell you about this particular relationship of hers, because as far as I am concerned, it is the first time I have met one of the relatives of any of the descendants of our great french hero in America.
The country of Belgium is one of America's closest friends. We served with Belgium in two wars, and we saw her bring about her renaissance after the tremendous destruction of World War II. Today she is a happy, prosperous country, a champion of liberty. And because she is a champion of liberty, she is a close relative of ours, because any two peoples that have this kind of similar dedication cannot fail to be brothers.
So I today deem it a great privilege that I can ask you--this company--to rise with me to drink a Toast to His Majesty the King of the Belgians.
