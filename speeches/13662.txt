SIGNING of this bill marks a new forward step in Western Hemisphere cooperation. For many years two of the world's most devastating livestock diseases--foot-and-mouth disease and rinderpest--have increasingly plagued the New World. I am glad to support this worthy legislation which Congress has wisely and quickly enacted.
It means that the United States now becomes the ally of Mexico in fighting off these highly infectious animal diseases, costly to livestock producers and consequently to the consumers of livestock products.
