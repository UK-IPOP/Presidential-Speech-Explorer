To the Congress of the United States:
I have the honor to present herewith a report of Federal activities in juvenile delinquency, youth development, and related fields, as required by section 408 of the Juvenile Delinquency Prevention and Control Act of 1968 (Public Law 90-445).
The report covers the period from July 1, 1968, to June 1970, and evaluates activities of the Youth Development and Delinquency Prevention Administration (formerly the Office of Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Development) in the Social and Rehabilitation Service of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, which is responsible for the program. It also includes a description of the activities of other Federal agencies and Departments in the field of juvenile delinquency.
Early in 1970 it became evident that certain changes in direction and emphasis in the program of the Youth Development and Delinquency Prevention Administration would be highly desirable. This report also incorporates these proposed changes.
I commend this report to your careful attention.
