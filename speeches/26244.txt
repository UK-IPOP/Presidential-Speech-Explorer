IN NEW YORK CITY this morning, bullets from a sniper's gun have brought heartbreak and horror. Again, senseless tragedy has struck at gunpoint. I call upon the Congress and all of the people of America to pass the gun control measures which are needed to protect the American people against insane and reckless murder by gunfire.
