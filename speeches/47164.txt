The Administration opposes House passage of H.R. 5222 because it would:


— unnecessarily restrict the ability of the Indian Health Service (IHS) to respond to the complete health needs of the individuals it serves by setting up several narrow categorical programs such as catastrophic health emergencies and juvenile alcohol and drug abuse. With its current broad authorities, the IHS can more effectively serve its eligible population.

— dilute resources going to eligible Indians who are members of federally-recognized tribes or who live on or near Indian reservations by expanding eligibility to cover several currently ineligible groups of Indians in California.

— unnecessarily and wastefully disrupt the organization of the Indian Health Service (IHS) by removing it from its present location with other health services programs in the Health Resources and Services Administration and making it a separate agency in the Public Health Service.

— maintain redundant sanitation construction authorities already in the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

— require numerous burdensome and costly reports, studies, and other new program responsibilities unrelated to the IHS basic health services delivery mission.

— establish a legislative priority in lieu of administrative discretion based on medical judgment by setting up a demonstration program in Gallup, New Mexico, to rehabilitate adult Navajo Indians suffering from alcoholism.
