The Administration strongly supports and urges Senate passage of H.R. 1298 without amendment. This bill, which has already passed the House of Representatives by a strong bipartisan vote of 375-41, provides the authorities to implement the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, which will dramatically expand the fight against AIDS across the globe. H.R.1298 authorizes $15 billion over five years for HIV/AIDS programs, including up to $1 billion for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria for FY 2004. It also authorizes continued U.S. international assistance programs for tuberculosis and malaria in more than fifty countries. Implementation of this bill is intended to prevent 7 million new infections, treat 2 million HIV-infected people with anti-retroviral drugs, and care for 10 million HIV-infected individuals and AIDS orphans.
President Bush recently urged Congress to pass this legislation with the "speed and seriousness this crisis requires," stating that the United States and other nations "have the ability and, therefore, the duty to confront this grave public health crisis." With enactment of this legislation, the United States will lead the world in forging a path of action and hope to help prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS, and treat and care for millions of individuals in Africa and the Caribbean affected by HIV/AIDS.
