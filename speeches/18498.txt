ON SEPTEMBER 25 I received from the Tariff Commission a report and recommendation with respect to additional fees on imports of almonds and an import quota on shelled filberts. I accepted the recommendation with respect to almonds and issued a proclamation in time for it to be effective on October 1. The matter of filberts was left for further consideration.
Since that time I have found no need for the imposition of a quota limitation on imports of shelled filberts, and I therefore am taking no action to impose new restrictions on imports of filberts for the coming crop year. My decision is based on several facts. One of these is that American growers seem assured of a return from their in-shell sales alone, in excess of their returns from their entire crop last year. I can find no justification for the belief expressed in the report that there is or is likely to be so severe a threat to American filberts as to warrant the imposition of an import quota.
Restrictive action with regard to filberts would fall almost entirely upon Turkey and would reduce its annual dollar earnings by over $1 Â½ million. This would be on top of a loss of dollar earnings already incurred by reason of an increased tariff on dried figs. Imposition of the recommended quota would seriously interfere with the emergency efforts to combat the serious Turkish financial crisis.
