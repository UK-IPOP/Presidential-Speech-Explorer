Senator John F. Kennedy charged today that Vice President Nixon's stand on Quemoy and Matsu may involve American boys in an unnecessary or futile war".
"He wants us committed to the defense of every rock and island around the world," Mr. Kennedy said "but he is unwilling to admit that this may involve American boys in an unnecessary or futile war." Moreover, he asserted, Mr. Nixon had "sought to have us involved" in the Indochina war in 1954.
