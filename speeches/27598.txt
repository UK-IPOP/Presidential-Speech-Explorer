Dear David:
I profoundly regret, even as I fully understand, that personal circumstances have deprived us of your continued services as Head of the United States Delegation to the Paris Peace Talks.
Your willingness to come out of retirement and once again help your country was but the latest demonstration of the dedication and unselfishness that have marked your more than thirty years of public service. We have been fortunate, during the past year, that we could draw upon the wisdom and patience accumulated throughout your remarkable career. You have served well the objectives of your country and the goal of peace.
It is my strong hope that we will be able to call on you for special assignments in the future. For you have shown once more your giant stature as a diplomat and as a man. You have my deep appreciation and admiration.

With warm regards.

Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
[The Honorable David K. E. Brace, American Embassy, Paris]
