Today, Romney for President released a new television advertisement titled "Doing Fine?" Last week, with millions out of work, homes falling into foreclosure, and the middle class getting squeezed more and more every day, President Obama inexplicably said "the private sector is doing fine." If President Obama can't see that our economy is broken, how can he fix it?
: 
 "The private sector is doing fine."
 "The private sector is doing fine."
 "The private sector is doing fine."
 "I'm Mitt Romney and I approve this message."
