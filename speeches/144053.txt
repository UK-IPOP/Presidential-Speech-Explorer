AF2 landed at JBA at 7:54 am.

Harris deplaned at 8:02 am with Emhoff. They were both in jeans and blazers.

They chatted with greeters — Matt Jones, Wing Commander at 89th Airlift Wing, JB Andrews, and wife Christie Jones — for a few minutes.

She didn't stop to chat with pool. She walked toward Marine Two at 8:04 am. Took off at 8:10 am.

Per VP's guidance for the day, she will be in the sit room briefing with the president at 8:30.

That's a wrap on the Asia trip. Happy Friday!
