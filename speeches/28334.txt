THE PRESIDENT and Mrs. Nixon were very saddened to learn of the tragic death last night of the Prime Minister of Iceland, Mrs. Benediktsson, and their grandson. The Prime Minister was well known and loved in this country. The Prime Minister was one of the original signators of the North Atlantic Treaty in 1949. Iceland has lost a great leader and we in this country have lost a good friend.
