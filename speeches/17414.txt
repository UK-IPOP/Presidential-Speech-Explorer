To Participants of the Conference on Fitness of American Youth:
Your willingness to participate in this Conference shows that you share my concern about the fitness of our American youth. It is certain that we can and should do more than we are now doing to help our young people become physically fit and therefore better qualified, in all respects, to face the requirements of modern life.
I very much appreciate your interest. Your conference deliberations will help guide the efforts of all of us who are interested in improving the total fitness of all our children and youth.
