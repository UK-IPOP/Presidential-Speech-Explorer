MR. PRIME MINISTER, this is an event to which I have long looked forward. It is a privilege and an honor to welcome you to this land--to this house.
I speak for the American people and the government when I say that we hope you will find your trip here most enjoyable-that you and your daughter will have a visit that is full of interest.
We thank you for coming.
