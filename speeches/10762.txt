IN A BUSINESS so vast and complex as that of the Federal Government a large part of the research work necessarily is carried out by special commissions and committees, delegated to investigate a given subject and to report to the President or to the Congress. They also act for the coordination of Government activities, recommend policies, represent the Government abroad or at national functions, and exercise semi-judicial or semi-legislative powers delegated by the Congress.
A great majority of these commissions are created, not by the President but, by the Congress upon its own motion. All of the commissions created by the President are for temporary nonadministrative purposes as are also a large number of those created by the Congress.
The number of commissions set up under recent administrations are:
By Congress President Total
President Roosevelt 107

President Taft 63

President Wilson 75 75 150

President Harding 44

President Coolidge 74 44 118

President Hoover 22 20 42
