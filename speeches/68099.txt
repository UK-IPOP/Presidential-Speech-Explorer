"Given the number of ads unveiled in the last week, somewhere inside the Clinton/Gore campaign there must a sign that reads "In case of emergency, release ad." In its panic, the Clinton campaign is resorting to ugly scare tactics. Even after months of co-opting Republican ideas, Bill Clinton is trapped by his liberal record -- complete with the largest tax increase in History. People like what Bob Dole is saying -- tax cuts, trust in the people, and the freedom to dream -- concepts Bill Clinton can't and won't deliver."
