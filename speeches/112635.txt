"When President Obama kicks off his campaign today in Columbus, he still needs to answer for the promises he made to Ohioans nearly four years ago.

If you've got health insurance, we're going to work with you to lower your premiums by $2500 per family per year. And we will not wait 20 years from now to do it or 10 years from now to do it. We will do it by the end of my first term as president of the United States of America." (Senator Barack Obama, Remarks, Columbus, OH, 2/27/08)
