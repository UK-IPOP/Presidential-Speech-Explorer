YOUR BIRTHDAY is a day all men of peace can celebrate with pride and hope. I am happy to join with the millions who salute your leadership and devotion. They promise us the day of greater celebration when conflict has ceased and reason is restored. May it come soon for you and all the brave who follow you.
