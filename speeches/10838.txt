My dear Mr. Eisner:
Please present my greetings to those assembled for the annual Regional Conference of the American Red Cross at Fort Monmouth. I trust that the deliberations of the representatives of the New Jersey Chapters may be fruitful in effective plans to meet the current demands upon the organization.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
