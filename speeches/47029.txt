The Administration urges that H.R. 5568 not be considered under suspension of the rules, but under a rule that will allow for amendments. The Administration would not object to House passage of H.R. 5568, but only if it is amended to delete provisions which the Administration opposes because they inappropriately encroach on State responsibilities. Accordingly, the bill should be amended to delete the provisions which would:


— interfere with the authority of States to prescribe periods of license disqualification for various offenses; and

— sanction States with the loss of grants for implementing the licensing program if they do not adopt a .10 percent blood alcohol content standard for commercial drivers or loss of grants for highway programs if they fail to adopt other Federal licensing requirements.
