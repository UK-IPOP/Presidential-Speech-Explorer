 - Early this week, Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich both agreed to participate in the NewsMax debate this December to be moderated by Donald Trump. Many in the media, political pundits and even some Republican Presidential Candidates have mocked the very idea - while some of the candidates are still weighing options.
Santorum issued the following statement about the upcoming NewsMax Donald Trump debate:
"Many of my opponents jockeyed to be the first to fly up to New York and use Donald Trump for a photo op and no doubt try and secure an endorsement. But when Donald wants to moderate a debate - they refuse to attend. That's what's so wrong with politics today - hypocrisy. At this critical time in our nation's history, just weeks before Iowan's cast this important vote - many of the other candidates want to hide behind TV ads and mail pieces. We plan to be there front and center in person to debate Newt directly, and if it's just the two of us, we're fine with it.
There's no doubt that any of us are better than Barack Obama - however, we can't afford to put up a person who can't clearly articulate a vision or has a glass jaw or a unprincipled past. Donald Trump knows business and knows global markets - and we all know he'll be able to bring in a broad audience. And let's be honest, at least Donald Trump will have more in common with the candidates than with the vast majority of past moderators."
