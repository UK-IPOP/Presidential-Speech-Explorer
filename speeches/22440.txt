Ladies and gentlemen:
We are delighted to welcome you here to witness the swearing in of Dr. Hornig.
Doctor, we welcome you to this room. It will be the scene of many future meetings for you. We look forward to receiving your advice and counsel and the benefit of your wisdom.
You are following an extremely able and very dedicated man, a man upon whom President Kennedy leaned heavily, and who has been a tower of strength to me during his entire period of service.
We hate to see him go; but since he is going we are glad to have his choice succeed him. Thank you very much.
