Dear Lee:
It is with deep regret that I accept your resignation effective, as you have requested, on August 31, 1970.
Your participation in my Administration during this crucially important initial period will always be a source of satisfaction to me. The skill, the wisdom and the seasoned judgment you have brought to your responsibilities here deserve a special accolade from all of us who have had the privilege of working with you, and I trust that you will take pride in the outstanding contribution you have made to the welfare of all of your fellow citizens.
While your intention to return to private life is a loss not only for me but also for all of your colleagues in Washington, I am grateful that we will continue to have your assistance as a member of the President's Science Advisory Committee. It is a pleasure to assure you of an appointment to a full four-year term on that Committee-when the vacancy occurs in December.
As you prepare to return to Southern California, I want you and Doris to know that the best wishes of the Nixons and of your many other friends here will be with you throughout the years ahead.

With warm personal regards,

Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
[Honorable Lee A. DuBridge, Director, Office of Science and Technology]
