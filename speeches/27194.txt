Mr. Prime Minister, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen:
I am very happy, on behalf of all Americans, to welcome you back to our country, Mr. Prime Minister, and to this Capital City that you know so well.
All of us will remember that you came here before as the Ambassador from your country. Today you return as Prime Minister. We are very .proud that a good friend who lived among us has found time to pay us a cordial visit in the position of great trust and distinction which you now hold.
Mr. Prime Minister, Afghanistan is far from us in miles and hours as we meet here this morning. But for us it is no longer a distant, far-off, remote place.
Countless Americans have come to know your country and to know your people.
President Eisenhower was your guest. Their Majesties King Zahir and Queen Homaira are warmly remembered by all of us for their visit here in 1963.
Ambassador Pazhwak is our good neighbor in New York where he now serves as President of the United Nations General Assembly.
So we meet today as friends. We live on opposite sides of the globe, yet we have much in common:
--Your land, like ours, has a strong tradition of freedom and independence.
--Your people, like ours, cherish diversity while they seek unity in mutual respect and justice.
--You, like us, are experimenters in the art of government and social reform.
--And we share a common dedication to peace, and to the ideal of a world community based on freedom.
Mr. Prime Minister, these are only a few of the ties which bind our nations and our peoples together. Historically, the relations between our countries have been very close and cordial. Today they are warmer than ever before. It is a very great honor and privilege to have you with us to discuss an even more productive future.
We are so happy that you could come to our land.
Thank you.
