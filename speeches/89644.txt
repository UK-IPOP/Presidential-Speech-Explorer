SANTA FE, NM -- New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson has jumped to 10% in the latest CNN/USA Today New Hampshire poll of Democratic Presidential candidates- a gain of 6 points since April. The poll was taken June 6-8, following the CNN/WMUR TV Democratic Presidential debate on June 3.
"New Hampshire voters clearly are responding to Governor Richardson's strong debate performance- they're getting to know him and learn about his unprecedented record of accomplishment," said Dave Contarino, Governor Richardson's campaign manager. "The new poll numbers are consistent with what we see as we travel throughout New Hampshire and the country - growing enthusiasm and support for Governor Richardson as people hear his vision for America. New Hampshire is critically important to our campaign strategy, and the Governor will continue to spend a lot of his time there. We're right where we want to be - slow, steady growth in the polls and on goal with fundraising."
Governor Richardson also hit the 10% mark in Iowa in a recent poll published by the Des Moines Register.
The list of candidates in the New Hampshire poll includes former Vice President Al Gore who is not a declared Presidential candidate. When he is removed from the list, Governor Richardson's number increases to 11%.
