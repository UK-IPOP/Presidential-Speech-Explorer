Good morning from Wilmington.
No updates other than this from the White House this morning:
The President will remain in Wilmington, Delaware for Father's Day weekend. The President has no public events scheduled.
Until 2pm.
Pool is holding outside POTUS residence. There has been no change to schedule or guidance on a movement - but you know how it sometimes goes on a Saturday afternoon.
Pool van tagged on to POTUS motorcade as it emerged from his street at 16:00.
Destination remains unconfirmed.
Pool van separated from motorcade and pulled up at back of St Joseph on the Brandywine at 16:03.
We just caught a glimpse of POTUS entering church before we could depart van.
No sign of the two or three protesters who sometimes turn up here.
POTUS exited church at 16:55 a moment after the first lady, who was carrying some sort of magnolia-colored plant or flower. He gave another churchgoer a big hug before talking to green-robed priest.
They turned right and went around into graveyard - out of sight of Pool - in the direction of Beau's grave.
FLOTUS was in tan raincoat.
POTUS in navy suit.
Pool loaded into van.

Pool van peeled off motorcade as it approached residence at 17:10.
