As Texas Governor, Rick Perry has taken unprecedented steps to secure the Texas-Mexico border and produced results.
Texas has provided $400 million in border security and law enforcement funding since 2005 to help fill the gap left by the federal government ($152 million in 2011; $121.5 million in 2009; $110.3 million in 2007, and $29.8 million through grant funds in 2005-2006). [1]
In August 2009, Texas expanded its border security efforts by sending highly skilled Ranger Reconnaissance (Ranger Recon) teams to address the ever-evolving threat along the Texas-Mexico border. [2]
Gov. Perry's border security initiatives have helped stem illegal activity along the border, resulting in the seizure of 6.8 million pounds of marijuana; 82,353 pounds of cocaine; 1,835 pounds of heroin; and 7,552 pounds of methamphetamine which has an estimated value of more than $6.5 billion. In addition, officers have seized $227 million in currency and more than 3,500 illegal weapons. [3]
Gov. Perry has made repeated requests to the White House and Congress for thousands more National Guard and Border Patrol troops, strategic fencing and Predator drones to monitor the U.S. Mexico border and provide real-time intelligence to law enforcement. [4]
Texas joined with several other states in opposing the federal lawsuit against Arizona's immigration enforcement policy. [5]
