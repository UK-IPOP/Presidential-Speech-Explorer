I HAVE BEEN wishing you "Happy Birthday" for as long as I can remember. But each time it is an even happier privilege to be counted among the thousands of your friends who are thinking of you and wishing you well. I hope you enjoy this one and many more to come.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Vice President John Nance Garner, Uvalde, Texas]
