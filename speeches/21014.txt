GEORGE I. BLOOM




As I pledged to you at our convention, I will have campaigned in every one of our Nation's 50 States by election day. I am supremely confident we will carry across the Nation if each of you rally your coworkers in a total commitment which will bring every voter for our ticket to the polls on November 8. I am confident that the American voters want a continuation of peace without surrender and prosperity without war. Our people know, too, that it is the voluntary efforts of 180 million Americans working through a free economy that will take us to the higher ground in the exciting and challenging decade ahead. This country does not want to go back to inflation, controls, and the artificialities of a wartime economy.
Pat joins with me in expressing our deepest appreciation for all you have done and will do in the final days of this crucial campaign. I hope you will convey these sentiments to our coworkers in the broadest possible manner.
DICK NIXON.
