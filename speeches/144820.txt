Good morning, I'm your pooler for the day.
Pool is expected to gather shortly for POTUS's arrival at the Ellipse.
Feel free to send me questions for Jen Psaki's noon press conference and I will try to get some of them in.
POTUS has just landed. Marine One wheels down at 9:21 am.
Apologies, we had two choppers come in and the first one was for staff. President Biden's just landed at 9:24 am.
President Biden emerged from Marine One, removed his mask, and then walked directly to his motorcade without stopping to take questions from press.
A lunch lid was just called until 11:45 am.
We just got the 2 minute warning on Jen Psaki's press briefing start. Briefing will be broadcast.
They just gave us the two minute warning for Biden's Covid response press conference in the East Room. The presser is televised and I'll send any color from the room as warranted.
A travel/photo lid was called at 1:48 pm.
I'll send along any post-lid updates if they come in. Have a good day, everyone.
In an earlier pool report I referred to Biden's remarks as a press conference. The White House has asked me to clarify that it was not a press conference, but rather: remarks.
