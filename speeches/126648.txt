 – Presidential candidate Ted Cruz today announced the expansion of his Hawaii Leadership Team, with the addition of legislators, Republican Party leaders, and conservative grassroots activists.
"All across this country people are coalescing around our campaign," said Cruz. "We are building a grassroots army all across the state of Hawaii and I am honored to have the support of so many courageous conservatives. With these leaders and our team in every corner of the Aloha State we are positioned to compete for every vote on Caucus night."
State Senator Sam Slom and State Representative Bob McDermott join with the previously announced leadership team of Rita Kama-Kimura, Marissa Kerns, and Willes Lee along with statewide, county, and coalition campaign leaders, plus conservative and Republican activists across the islands.
