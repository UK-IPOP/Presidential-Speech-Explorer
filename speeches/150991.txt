Pool Reports by 
, 
Hello from Los Angeles, where it's a gorgeous sunny and 65 degree day. The pool has been tested and swept, and loaded into vans for departure. We are holding for the VP.
Guidance from the VP's office on today's activities:
At 12:00 PM PT, the Vice President will depart Los Angeles International Airport en route to Joint Base Andrews. Departure from Los Angeles, CA will be pooled press.
At 7:25 PM ET, the Vice President will arrive at Joint Base Andrews. Arrival will be pooled press.
More to come!
VP drove by the pool van at 11:35am, we are rolling to LAX.
After an uneventful ride, the VP arrived at LAX and exited the vehicle at 11:58am. She promptly walked up the stairs, turned around and waved at the top, and walked on to the plane.
Wheels up at 12:14pm bound for JBA.
After an uneventful flight, AF2 touched down at JBA at 7:39pm EST.
The VP exited AF2 at 7:49pm. She donned a jacket to come down the stairs, as it is a much colder 39 degrees here at JBA than it was in LA.
She waved to the pool but did not stop to chat.
She entered Marine 2 at 7:50pm, wheels up at 7:56pm.
That's it from me, have a good night!
