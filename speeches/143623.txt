Today, 15 recipients of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences signed a letter in support of President's Biden's economic recovery agenda, which they argue will make "critical investments in human capital, the care economy, research and development, public education, and more, which will reduce families' costs."
They write: "While we all have different views on the particulars of various economic policies, we believe that key components of this broader agenda are criticalâ€”including tax reforms that make our tax system more equitable and that enable our system to raise the additional funds required to facilitate necessary public investments and achieve our collective goals. Because this agenda invests in long-term economic capacity and will enhance the ability of more Americans to participate productively in the economy, it will ease longer-term inflationary pressures."
