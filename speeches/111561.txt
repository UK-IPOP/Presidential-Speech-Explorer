"Every day delivers more disappointing news for the millions of Americans struggling in the Obama economy. Consumer spending and manufacturing activity is down, while economic uncertainty is up. Americans deserve better — they deserve a president who has what it takes to get middle-class families back on their feet." —Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 OBAMA: "Just like we've tried their plan, we tried our plan — and it worked. That's the difference. That's the choice in this election. That's why I'm running for a second term." (President Barack Obama,

 "Spending by American consumers fell in June for the first time in nearly a year when accounting for inflation, suggesting the economy lost momentum as it ended the second quarter. Consumer spending, which makes up about 70 percent of economic activity, fell 0.1 percent when adjusted for rising prices, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday."

 "Americans' confidence in the economy declined last week to -29, matching levels not seen since early January. The decline may be due to the estimate of slower-than-hoped second quarter GDP growth." (Jenny Marlar, "Economic Confidence Down Last Week, Back To January Levels,"

 "Hope for the future generation has reached an all-time low. Just 14% of Americans expect today's children to be better off than their parents. The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that 65% of American Adults do not expect today's children to be better off than their parents. Twenty-one percent (21%) are not sure what to expect." ("New Low: Just 14% Think Today's Children Will Be Better Off Than Their Parents,"

 "The share of American 18- to 24-year-olds who were employed fell to 54 per cent last year, the lowest since the labour department began tracking data in 1948, according to the Pew Research Center. The jobless rate for Americans age 16 to 24 is above 16 per cent, more than twice the national rate." (Shannon Bond, "Jobless Generation Puts Brakes On US,"

 "But the problem has a unique flavour in the US, where the weak job market has collided with record levels of educational debt — about $25,000 for the average graduate. Together, they pose a threat to the future earning power of young Americans such as Mr Grzywacz — and could have long-lasting effects on US growth."

 "While a university degree still promises a higher income than a high school diploma, the median income of college graduates fell nearly 10 per cent from 2007 to 2010, according to the Fed, compared with a 5 per cent fall for high school graduates."

 "But the overall jobless rate, which now stands at 8.2%, doesn't tell the whole story. For example, the national unemployment rate doesn't take into account people who want to work but haven't looked for a job in the previous four weeks because they figured none were available. The national unemployment rate also doesn't account for people in part-time jobs who would prefer full-time work." (Neil Shah, "States' Hidden Jobless Woes,"

 "To get a broader view that encompasses both groups, economists at the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics track the under-employment, or U-6, rates for states and the entire country. According to Labor Department figures released late last week, California and Nevada are struggling not just with high unemployment, but also severe under-employment. California's average unemployment rate from July 2011 through June 2012 was 11.2%, but its broader under-employment rate was far higher, at 20.3%." (Neil Shah, "States' Hidden Jobless Woes,"
