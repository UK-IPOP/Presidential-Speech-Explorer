"Vice President Biden is using Social Security to fabricate the Obama campaign's latest false attacks. However, these attacks will backfire when voters learn he has repeatedly supported higher Social Security taxes, and that seniors face a 25% across-the-board benefit cut because of President Obama's failure to lead on this issue. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have a plan to save and strengthen Social Security that does not raise taxes and ensures that our middle-class seniors receive all of the benefits they've earned." — Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 "The Obama campaign is dispatching Vice President Joe Biden to Florida to deliver a new attack on the Republican ticket over entitlements: He'll allege that Mitt Romney's economic plan could force senior citizens to pay more in taxes on their Social Security benefits."

 "The trust fund ratio, which indicates the number of years of program cost that could be financed solely with current trust fund reserves, peaked in 2008, declined through 2011, and is expected to decline further in future years. After 2020, Treasury will redeem trust fund assets in amounts that exceed interest earnings until exhaustion of trust fund reserves in 2033, three years earlier than projected last year. Thereafter, tax income would be sufficient to pay only about three-quarters of scheduled benefits through 2086." ("A Summary Of The 2012 Annual Reports,"

 "Social Security is rushing even faster toward insolvency, driven by retiring baby boomers, a weak economy and politicians' reluctance to take painful action to fix the huge retirement and disability program. The trust funds that support Social Security will run dry in 2033 — three years earlier than previously projected — the government said Monday."

 "Vice President Joe Biden told cafe patrons in Virginia on Tuesday that he could 'guarantee' he and President Obama would allow no changes to Social Security. As a debate over reforming entitlements -- particularly Medicare -- takes center stage in the 2012 presidential campaign, Biden seemed to promise not to allow changes to the program. ... 'Number one, I guarantee you, flat guarantee you, there will be no changes in Social Security,' Biden said, per a pool report. 'I flat guarantee you.'"

 "David Axelrod struggled Monday to articulate President Barack Obama's second-term plan for Social Security before saying 'this is not the time' to talk about Obama's proposals. ... Pressed by Time's Mark Halperin for more specifics on Obama's plan, Axelrod suggested the administration would reveal its plans when Congress was ready to talk about a "balanced" approach to reforming entitlements. 'Mark, I'll tell you what,' Axelrod said. 'When you get elected to the United States Senate, and sit at that table — this is not the time.'"

 "President-elect Barack Obama pledged yesterday to shape a new Social Security and Medicare 'bargain' with the American people, saying that the nation's long-term economic recovery cannot be attained unless the government finally gets control over its most costly entitlement programs."
