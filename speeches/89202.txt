 Fox News' Shepard Smith: "We've often said that the amount of money you raise can be a good indicator of how things are going. Rudy Giuliani's campaign just announced that he's raised more than $17 million in the second quarter for both the primary and general elections, ended the quarter with no debt and $18 million cash on hand. That far outpaces the rest of the Republican candidates." (Fox News' "Studio B," 7/3/07)
