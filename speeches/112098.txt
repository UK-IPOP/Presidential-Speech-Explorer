Today, Romney for President released a new web video, "Dismal." The Obama campaign recently released a Spanish-language web ad asserting that "we're on the right path." Mitt Romney disagrees and believes that rising unemployment and more Hispanics in poverty is not the "right path" for our country. America can do better and, with Mitt Romney as president, we will.
