Thanks for your wire. It was a comfort, and also all of Maryâ€™s suggestions. I was doing not badly until the Middle East came apart and then the public was, thanks to years of conditioned ignorance, rushed into endorsing the author of our disaster. But, of course, little of this is being revealed by the press. However, there are many people extremely anxious about the state of the public understanding and to this maybe I can still make some little contribution in the future.
