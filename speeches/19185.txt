[Released January 1, 1960. Dated December 31, 1959]
Dear Mr. Attorney General:
Thank you for the informative report relating to deceptive practices in broadcasting media which you prepared at my request and submitted to me on December 30, 1959.
The report indicates that there may be further developments and that the governmental bodies concerned have not completed all of the action which they may be considering. I would therefore appreciate it if you continued to follow the matter for me. Please advise me of developments and report your recommendations from time to time as you consider it appropriate.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
