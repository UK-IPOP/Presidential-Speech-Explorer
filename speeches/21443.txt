SENATOR KENNEDY CALLS NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS
Senator John F. Kennedy announced today that he is calling a National Conference on Constitutional Rights and American Freedom in New York City on Tuesday and Wednesday, October 11 and 12.
The conference will seek to review and clarify the positive steps needed to insure full constitutional rights for all Americans--
said Senator Kennedy.

  I am inviting leaders of thought and of action to meet together to throw light on these problems. The test for all of us must be the Constitution. My hope is that this conference will contribute to a constructive atmosphere in which the spirit of the Constitution is respected everywhere in our land. This is a good time for the rededication of the Democratic Party and the American people to the aims and principles of the Constitution. That is what our people and the world expect and are waiting for.

Senator Kennedy is issuing invitations to the conference this week.
The conference will divide itself into three working panels:

  1. Executive action.

  2. Legislation.

  3. State and local leadership.

Each of the panels will report and give its recommendations in person to Senator Kennedy at the conclusion of the 2-day conference. Senator Kennedy will address the conference participants and the public at a New Frontiers of Freedom Rally in New York City on the afternoon of October 12.
Mayor Robert F. Wagner of New York City will act as host to the conference.
Senator Kennedy announced that he had appointed Charles Tyroler II, of Washington, D.C., and Harris L. Wofford, Jr., of South Bend, Md., as his personal representatives in charge of planning the 2-day conference. Mr. Tyroler is the executive director of the Democratic Advisory Council. Mr. Wofford is assistant to Senator Kennedy.
