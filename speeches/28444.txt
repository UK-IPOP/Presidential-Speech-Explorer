Dear Mr. Secretary:
In order to effect a saving in money and manpower, I have decided to deactivate the Presidential cabin cruisers Patricia and Julie, which are operated by the Naval Administrative Unit.
You are, therefore, directed to offer these craft for disposal outside of the Department of Defense in a manner appropriate and befitting of their service to the administrations of five Presidents.
By separate correspondence, my Military Assistant will effect concurrent personnel reductions for the Naval Administrative Unit.
Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON

[Honorable Melvin Laird, Secretary of Defense, Washington, D.C.]
