Dear Mrs. Cherry:
With sadness and grief, I join all who mourn the death of Francis Cherry, respected judge, able Governor of Arkansas, and dedicated servant of the public good.
I particularly want to express my sympathy to his family and dear ones, and to the countless citizens of Arkansas who have lost in his passing a distinguished leader, and a native son whose devotion to constitutional principles and human dignity won for him the confidence and admiration of all who knew him.
His life has left for his State and nation a rich legacy of accomplishment.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Mrs. Francis A. Cherry, 5324 Albemarle Street NW., Washington, D.C.]
