 certain lands in the State of Arkansas which have been acquired or are in process of acquisition by the United States through the Farm Security Administration under authority of the National Industrial Recovery Act, approved June 16, 1933 (48 Stat. 195), and the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935, approved April 8, 1935 (49 Stat. 115), together with certain adjoining public lands, are adjacent to the Ouachita National Forest; and
 it appears that such lands are suitable for national-forest purposes and that it would be in the public interest to reserve and include them as part of the said Ouachita National Forest:
 President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the power vested in me by section 24 of the act of March 3, 1891, 26 Stat. 1095, 1103, as amended (U.S.C., title 16, sec. 471), the act of June 4, 1897, 30 Stat. 34, 36 (U.S.C., title 16, sec. 473), the said National Industrial Recovery Act, the said Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935, and section 32 (c) of the act of July 22, 1937, 50 Stat. 526, do proclaim (1) that all lands of the United States within the areas shown as additions on the diagram attached hereto and made a part hereof are hereby included in and reserved as a part of the Ouachita National Forest, and (2) that all lands within such areas which are in process of acquisition by the United States through the Farm Security Administration under the authority of the said National Industrial Recovery Act and the said Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935 shall upon the acquisition of title thereto be reserved and administered as part of the said Forest.
The reservation made by this proclamation shall as to all lands which are at this date legally appropriated under the public-land laws or reserved for any public purpose other than for classification under Executive Order No. 6964 of February 5, 1935, as amended, be subject to, and shall not interfere with or defeat, legal rights under such appropriation, nor prevent the use for such public purpose of lands so reserved, so long as such appropriation is legally maintained or such reservation remains in force.
Executive Order No. 7662 of July 17, 1937, withdrawing certain public lands in Arkansas for the use of the Department of Agriculture, is hereby revoked.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 30" day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-third.
