ARLINGTON, VA -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today released its latest television ad entitled "Celeb." The ad highlights Barack Obama's opposition to offshore drilling and proposals to raise taxes on energy sources that produce much of this nation's electricity. While Barack Obama is the biggest celebrity in the world -- attracting 200,000 fans in Berlin -- that doesn't do much to help American families who need relief from high gas prices today or answer the question of whether he's ready to lead. The ad will air on national cable and in key states.
