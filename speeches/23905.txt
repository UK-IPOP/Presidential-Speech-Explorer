WE WANT to express appreciation to John Rockefeller and to the university for the recognition which they brought to distinguished civil servants of our Government. And in honoring them they honor all those who work for the Government.
I think it is too often that the Government work has been caricatured, rather than honored as it should be. I think the kind of skills which the recipients this year have brought to the public service, and the diligence of their work, places the American people in their debt.
I hope these awards will encourage others who work in the Government to double their efforts and also will encourage those who are considering a career in Government, a career in Civil Service, a career in the Foreign Service, a career in space, a career in housing, and all the rest, to come and work with us. It represents, really, in many ways, the most rewarding of careers in the 1960's.
I think that all who are associated with the program are to be commended. In several cases the Government beat you to it in honoring them.

Thank you.
