My fellow Americans, there is very little that can be said in presenting the President of the United States tonight that has not already been said by millions of Americans—Republicans, Democrats, independents—in their votes today.
I only think of this. I think of the fact that this is a great moment for the party—the Republican Party—of which the President is the leader. It is also a very great moment for our country.
Because, as we look to the future, we realize that the President of the United States, and his policies and leadership in the field of foreign affairs, has received a tremendous vote of approval by the people of the country, regardless of their partisan affiliations.
And that means that in the next four years that the President will speak as he has in the last four years, as one who represents the great majority of Americans. And he will continue to assert the tremendous influence for good, for peace, in the years ahead that he has in the past four years.
Forty-five years ago, a young man, born in Texas, raised in Abilene, Kansas, came to West Point. And there, like all other young Americans from all the states of the Union, he took to his heart the moral of those who go to the Point: Duty, honor, country.
For forty-five years he has lived that motto in every moment of his life.
The highest tribute ever paid to an American President was paid to our first President—George Washington.
First in war, first in peace, first in the hearts of his countrymen.
Tonight, I present to you the President of the United States, who also deserves that highest tribute—President Eisenhower.
