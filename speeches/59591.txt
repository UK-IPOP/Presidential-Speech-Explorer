 Mr. President, are you going to invite Arafat and Rabin to the ceremonies on Monday?
 The parties will decide, as they've made all the other decisions, who will come to the ceremony. Whatever their decision is is fine with me.
 Can you give us an idea of what the United States is prepared to do to help this agreement work?
 I'll be talking a little more about that later, and I'll have a statement as soon as this meeting is over. I want to talk to the Members here about it first.
 Well, can you give us an idea of what this meeting is all about?
 Well, we're going to brief them on—the Secretary of State and I are—about, obviously, our strong support for the agreement, what America's responsibilities will be, what our allies and friends around the world are interested in doing about it, and where we go from here.
