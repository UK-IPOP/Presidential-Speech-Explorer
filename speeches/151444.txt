Yesterday, the President established an inter-agency group led by the Domestic Policy Council and the National Security Council to increase and better coordinate U.S. Government efforts to counter antisemitism, Islamophobia, and related forms of bias and discrimination within the United States. The President has tasked the inter-agency group, as its first order of business, to develop a national strategy to counter antisemitism.
As President Biden has made clear: antisemitism has no place in America. All Americans should forcefully reject antisemitism – including Holocaust denial – wherever it exists.
"I look forward to working with President Biden and his administration on building an effective, unified national strategy based on strengthening education, protecting public safety, training law enforcement and data collection, coalition building with other groups, and above all, public leadership."

"I strongly support President Biden's decision to establish an interagency group to coordinate against the rise in hate, bias and discrimination in the United States. Having an interagency group to coordinate efforts against antisemitism, Islamophobia and other forms of discrimination will help us better understand the problem and counter it. The FBI today released its annual report on hate crimes in the United States. The report shows that hate crimes based on race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation and other characteristics occur far too frequently. Hate and intolerance have no place in our country, and I'm pleased the Biden administration is taking additional steps to combat it." [
