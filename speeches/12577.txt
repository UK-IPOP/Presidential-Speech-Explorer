 by Proclamation No. 2223 of February 1, 1937, issued under the authority of section 318 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (46 Stat. 696), an emergency was declared to exist on account of disastrous floods then occurring in the valleys of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers and tributaries thereof, making it necessary to extend aid on a large scale to the flood sufferers: and
 by the said proclamation the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to permit during the continuance of the emergency, and within such limits and subject to such conditions as he might deem necessary, the importation free of duty of such food, clothing, and medical, surgical, and other supplies as he might designate, when imported for use in such emergency relief work; and
 the said proclamation provides that the termination of the emergency shall be determined by the President and declared by his proclamation:
, President of the United States of America, have determined, and do hereby declare and proclaim, that the emergency on which Proclamation No. 2223 of February 1, 1937, was based no longer exists, and I do hereby revoke the said proclamation.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 27th day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-first.
