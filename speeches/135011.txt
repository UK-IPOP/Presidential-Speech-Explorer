H.J. Res. 31— Making Further Continuing Appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for Fiscal Year 2019, and for Other Purposes
(Rep. Roybal-Allard, D-CA)

The Administration opposes H.R. 648, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, and H.J. Res. 31, making further continuing appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for fiscal year 2019, and for other purposes.

The Administration is committed to working with the Congress to reopen agencies affected by lapsed appropriations, but any effort to do so must address the security and humanitarian crisis on our southern border and should restore funding for all agencies affected by the lapse.

For fiscal year 2019, the Administration has clearly and repeatedly communicated the requirements for border security, including through a recent letter from the Office of Management and Budget to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees on January 6, 2019.

Presenting these bills to the President without a broader agreement to address the border crisis is unacceptable. The Administration believes the package under consideration in the Senate—the End the Shutdown and Secure the Border Act—constitutes such an agreement, and supports its passage as quickly as possible.

The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact appropriations legislation that adequately addresses the crisis on our southern border and reopens the Federal Government for the American people as soon as possible.
