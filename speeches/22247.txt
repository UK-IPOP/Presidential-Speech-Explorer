Ladies and gentlemen and award winners:
I am very grateful to the Attorney General and to Mr. J. Edgar Hoover and to the other men and women of the Department of Justice who helped in the selection of these fine young men and women.
I regret that Solicitor General Cox was unable to be here today, but I am very proud to be here in the company of these outstanding young people, their parents, Members of Congress who found it possible to come here and enjoy this ceremony with us.
They are here as representatives of the many young Americans who perform great deeds of courage and important acts of service to their friends and to their communities. You know, we hear and read so much about delinquency that I know that all of us find special enjoyment in seeing these young people and hearing the Attorney General tell us of their outstanding deeds of heroism and bravery.
We tend to hear and read more about misdeeds than about good deeds these days, but what these young people have done is to remind us of all of the fine qualities of our fine youth. We all read of the young girl who was being attacked and stabbed to death while some 30 people watched in 'apathy. No one even called the police. When asked later why, they simply said they didn't want to be involved.
These young men and women here today were willing to be involved. They were involved, as all of us must be involved, if our country is to remain strong and free and if we are to achieve our goal.
So to Elaine, Marshall, Jean, and Gary, you have set an example for all of us by volunteering to help other people who are less fortunate than yourselves. So on behalf of a grateful Nation, I want to congratulate these young Americans, congratulate their mothers and fathers, their States, their neighborhoods which produced them. They are a great credit to their country.
We wish them well and we are delighted they could come here and visit the White House this morning.
