Austin, TX - This week, the Obama Campaign began airing two new radio ads across Texas. The ads highlight Barack Obama's diverse coalition of support and commitment to addressing the tough challenges everyday Americans face.
"The choice in this election is not between religions or genders. It's not about rich versus poor; young versus old; black versus white," Senator Obama says in the ad. "It's about the past versus the future."
See below for scripts of both ads along with links for audio.
