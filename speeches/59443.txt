The Administration strongly supports S. 636.



S. 636 could affect both direct spending and receipts; therefore it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. The Office of Management and Budget's preliminary estimate is that the net pay-as-you-go effect of the bill is zero.
