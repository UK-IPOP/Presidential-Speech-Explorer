I WANT to express my very warm welcome to all those who are the winners of this year's awards; also those who were previous winners, as well as the young boys and girls who are here today and who represent our great hopes. I want to especially express our great admiration for the work which was done in 1961
Miss Cochran, who, as was stated, has won this trophy six times, which is an extraordinary record, and as was stated, I'm the fourth President to present her with an award, and I'm sure that my successors will be fulfilling the same happy function in other years. So we're delighted to have you here.
Then we want to congratulate the distinguished pilot who, following Colonel Lindbergh's route, traveled it in one-tenth the time, and in the short space of 35 years we have so cut down time and space, and the world is becoming so small, so intimate, that we hope friendship will result from it.
Then we want to congratulate those who went so high as well as those who went so fast. The feat of taking this balloon to over 110,000 feet, of winning these great honors for our country, we want to congratulate those who accomplished that.
We're particularly glad to have Mrs. Prather here again. It was my pleasure to present her with the Distinguished Flying Cross for her husband, and I'm sure she knows how proud we are of her and her family. We're glad to have the mother of her late husband here also, and the children who have come, who're bound to be outstanding.
So we're glad to have all of you here. This the Presidents award is the outstanding award of its kind in our country. I'm sure that all my predecessors took the same satisfaction out of presenting it that I do. We have some of the previous winners. Colonel Lindbergh is one of these, Bernt Balchen, Major de Seversky, Mr. Sikorsky, and others. And all those who travel this great ocean of space have our admiration.
