The Administration opposes enactment of S. 2792 unless amended to:


— eliminate the provisions in current law and S. 2792 which indemnify pesticide owners and manufacturers for economic losses suffered when EPA cancels a pesticide. The potential cost of this provision is enormous; it requires EPA to reimburse profitable private industries, and there is no comparable provision in other environmental law;

— eliminate groundwater provisions. EPA already has the authority to regulate chemicals that pose groundwater problems in three other environmental laws. Additional legislation will only increase confusion for EPA and the States;

— eliminate the rigid, mandatory and legally enforceable nature of deadlines for making decisions on inert ingredients in pesticides. The Agency should be allowed discretion on how to deal with inerts; and

— eliminate any procedural changes to FIFRA concerning the export of pesticides and the provisions concerning international assistance. International consensus has been reached by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development on an export notification system, and it would be premature to change it now.
