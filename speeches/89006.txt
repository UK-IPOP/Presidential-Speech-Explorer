 This NIE provides a broad, strategic, and coordinated framework for understanding the terrorist threat to the United States over the next three years. It provides the Intelligence Community's baseline judgments in order to help policymakers develop and prioritize the government's response.
 We have built new institutions to better coordinate homeland defense and intelligence collection, developed new tools to monitor and track terrorists and their finances, and marshaled all national resources to attack the terrorist enemies at war with us.
 Since 9/11, al-Qaeda and those inspired by its hateful ideology have carried out terrorist attacks in more than two dozen nations. They have plotted against the U.S. but have thus far not succeeded in attacking us â€“ in part because we have taken bold action at home and abroad to keep our people safe.
 We have asked the American people to remain vigilant as well and to report suspicious activity.
 This includes passing a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Modernization bill that will make America safer by improving our intelligence capabilities while protecting privacy interests. This 1978 law should be updated to take into account the sweeping telecommunications advances that could not have been anticipated by Congress and that will allow the FISA Court and law enforcement officials to concentrate attention and resources on appropriate communications.
