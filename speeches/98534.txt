ARLINGTON, VA -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today released its latest television ad, entitled "Debra." The ad features Debra Bartoshevich, a lifelong Democrat and former Clinton delegate, explaining why she supports John McCain. Because John McCain has the experience and judgment we need at these challenging times, millions of Democrats from across the country are supporting him. The ad will air in key states.
