To the Congress of the United States:
I transmit herewith a report by the Acting Secretary of State recommending legislation authorizing an increase in the salary of the Minister Resident and Consul General of the United States to Liberia from $5,000 to $10,000 per annum.
I am in full accord with the reasons advanced by the Acting Secretary of State in support of the increase and I strongly urge upon the Congress the enactment of legislation authorizing it.
