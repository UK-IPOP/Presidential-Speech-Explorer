  Hundreds of Rubio supporters packed Sugden Plaza in downtown Naples for a quick meet-and-greet with the senator. Rubio may be far behind Trump in polls, but he was the star walking through the enthusiastic crowd and snapping cell phone photos with supporters as he made his way to Yabba Island Grill.
It was a burst of excitement for the Naples crowd, eager to get involved in this presidential race before Tuesday's primary. In always important Florida, where all 99 Republican delegates go to the winner, Rubio is the first presidential candidate from either party to mingle with a crowd during such a public appearance in Collier or Lee counties.

  Blake Walker used his 10-year-old son Brayden as a wedge to get close to Rubio. The tactic worked. Both father and son squeezed to the front to shake his hand.
"I told him, 'Please beat Trump for me,'" Brayden said, beaming after the encounter. "He said, 'I'll try.'"
Joan Hoffmeister of Naples was at the front of the line to meet Rubio on Friday.
"I want to stop Trump," she said, "because I don't like his image of America, of our values."
