 I bet you are happy for it. And we were very excited for the Italian people as they celebrated the magnificent victory.
Romano and I talked about a lot of issues that face the world. No question, when Italy and the United States works together, along with other countries, we're able to achieve important breakthroughs.

 Yes, sir. Thank you, Romano.
