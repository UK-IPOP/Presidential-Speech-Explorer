Verona, PA - Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney has spent much of his time on the campaign trail either attacking Rick Santorum for his past support of earmarks or touting his "turnaround" ability in running the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympic Games. However, there's a serious inconsistency in Romney's support for Federal appropriations and the true catalyst for the Olympic "turnaround."
Hogan Gidley, National Communications Director, said, "Mitt Romney's negative-only style politics is sad and desperate. And just like his previous attacks, this latest attack about earmarks is hypocritical too. We all know Romney was his own lobbyist for millions in earmarks - who does he honestly think he's fooling? Unfortunately it's just what we've come to expect from Mitt Romney.
In fact, we just learned today that Mitt Romney's PAC is up to $12 million in negative-only attacks - and now Romney's very own campaign is pushing millions in negative ads too. After 4 years as Governor and 6 years of running for president, it's clear that Mitt Romney would rather tear down someone else than talk about his own record. The only contender in this race that is giving voters a hopeful vision for America is Rick Santorum. Polls continue showing the desperate politics of destruction displayed by both Mitt Romney and Barack Obama will fall flat on voters looking to restore American hopefulness and American greatness."
 Romney outlines in detail his lobbying of Senator Ted Stevens and Senator John McCain for federal funding for the Utah games.
