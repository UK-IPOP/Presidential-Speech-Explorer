THANK YOU very much. Quite naturally, I am very proud to receive an award from such an Association, from such a group. There is an added distinction because it bears the name of one of our greatest professionals and our greatest citizens.
On the other hand, Mr. Colt, I rarely felt quite so unworthy of receiving an award because my part in the organization of this National Fund was really getting someone else to do the work. It would be far more fitting this morning if I were presenting this to you, because you have been President of that Association from the beginning.
But I can say this: I don't know of any group that is doing more necessary and worthwhile work than making certain that our medical schools have ample funds from private sources to keep running, because this is one profession we don't want to get under the dead hand of bureaucracy, I assure you.
Thank you again, Mr. Colt--and Mrs. Lahey, may I thank you for being with us.
