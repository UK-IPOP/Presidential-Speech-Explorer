The Administration strongly opposes enactment of H.R. 842, which would remove the majority of transportation programs from the unified Federal Budget. The Administration is committed to Balancing the Federal Budget within the next seven years and, in fact, has proposed a plan that achieves balance by 2002. Enactment of H.R. 842 would jeopardize this shared national objective. It could also force cuts in other General Fund programs in the coming years of up to $50 billion.

The unified Federal Budget ensures that all receipts and outlays are presented in one place, that they are considered as progress is measured toward a balanced budget, and that decisions between public and private spending and among budgetary priorities are made clear.

H.R. 842, which would remove the transportation.trust funds from the unified Federal Budget, is objectionable because it:

The Administration supports a balanced approach to infrastructure spending and deficit reduction. The President's FY 1997 Budget achieves this by requesting an increase over FY 1996 for Department of Transportation programs, while balancing the budget by FY 2002.



H.R. 842 would normally be subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. H.R. 842, however, exempts the transportation trust funds from the pay-as-you-go and other constraints on deficit spending associated with the unified budget.
