Yesterday, President Biden presented the Build Back Better Framework to Congress, and highlighted its transformative investment in climate, care, and kids, that will lower the costs of things families depend on, help people get back to work, and grow the economy.
The Framework is designed to level the playing field and make corporations and the wealthiest pay their fair share, so that middle class families can finally get some breathing room.
President Biden heard input from all sides and announced a Build Back Better framework he is confident will pass through Congress and be signed into law, delivering generational investments in the economy for working people.
The Build Back Better Framework will transform the lives of millions of children, saving parents thousands of dollars, and adding two years of free, universal schooling to our education system for the first time in over 100 years. It will be the largest effort to combat climate change in history. It will cut taxes for tens of millions of middle-class families. It is the biggest expansion of affordable health care in a decade. As the President said, it's a big darn deal.
Business leaders applauded the President and praised the framework.
"The framework of a deal to pass the president's economic agenda announced today presents an opportunity to level the playing field for small business owners and transform our economy for the better. Investments in our workforce, the care economy, and infrastructure will invigorate the Main Street economy, and small business owners are eager to see it pass swiftly. While this framework is critical, we know it doesn't include everything the country needs. After we pass this deal, we must keep pushing for critical policies like paid family and medical leave for every American, policies that reduce healthcare costs for small businesses and even more reforms to build a more equitable tax system for small businesses. However, this historic deal begins to level the playing field for small businesses by closing corporate tax loopholes, which will help prevent large multinational corporations from dodging their responsibilities. It is encouraging to see steps taken to ensure corporations pay their fair share and help provide revenue for the important investments the deal makes. Small business owners are eager to see these investments because they help Main Street businesses, families, workers, and bottom lines." [

"A big reason for today's labor shortage crisis is that women with children either can't find quality or affordable childcare. The Build Back Better package will effectively address this issue by both helping low- and moderate-income families with childcare costs and creating free, universal pre-kindergarten programs for 3 and 4 year olds."

"Over a hundred years ago, American ingenuity and hard work enabled the rise of transportation fueling infrastructure within 15 years. We are on the cusp of another energy revolution, driven by the same set of dynamics. But for electric vehicles to truly gain mass adoption, the infrastructure required to refuel these vehicles has to be rolled out at scale, like AMPLY's Omega Charge Management System. The Build Back Better Act will help drive implementation of infrastructure investments across the nation while creating good jobs and averting runaway climate change." [

"When given the opportunity, communities will choose a clean energy future. We see it day in and day out -- but we need investments from the federal government to ensure this opportunity is truly available for all. The Build Back Better Act includes exactly this type of investment and, once passed, will set our country on a better energy path that tackles climate change and reimagines how we power our communities." [Statement, 10/28/21]
"Bold, generational investments in clean energy and climate solutions like those included in the Build Back Better Act are a crucial part of the path to a net-zero future that will create jobs and put us on track to solve the climate crisis. By spurring innovation that will provide businesses, schools, non-profits, and municipalities with affordable renewable energy, these investments will rapidly speed up the clean energy transition and unleash significant private sector funds. Furthermore, they will provide unparalleled opportunities to create jobs in areas like American manufacturing for veterans seeking a new career. Veterans, like myself, are already a major part of the growth of clean energy and by passing the Build Back Better Act, Congress will make an important down payment to protect our nation's heroes." [Statement, 10/28/21]
"Technology innovations in clean energy hardware, software, and the cloud have created an opportunity to build a rapidly growing clean energy economy that works for everyone. The Build Back Better Act will help companies like ours rapidly expand access to clean energy, provide good-paying jobs, and speed the transition to a clean energy future. Now is the time to pass a bold package like this; Congress must work expeditiously to get this done for the American people, our businesses, and our planet." [

"The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) is happening, and the deployment of EV charging infrastructure will create jobs and combat climate change. EVgo commends the Build Back Better Act's focus on both consumer and infrastructure incentives which are needed in tandem to make Electric for All a reality." [

"The Build Back Better Act is a huge step forward in meeting President Biden's climate goals. But meeting them is going to take collective will, some social consensus, and leadership from the government and the private sector, and I hope that Congress finds the will to pass this legislation. As the leader of a clean energy company, we are ready to build the infrastructure we need to save the planet but we need the support outlined in the BBBA to do it. As a nation, we've accomplished great things with collective will, and I know we can do it again." [

"The transition to a clean energy economy fueled by solar and other renewables is not optional, it is an imperative. Investments made by the Build Back Better Act will deliver more affordable energy and transformational results to ensure that future generations have reliable power, good paying jobs, and clean air. This means Congress must act now to cement a better future for our country and our planet. We look forward to working with them to make this happen." [

"Arizonans are living on the frontlines of the climate crisis, and it is destroying our communities, burdening our families, and devastating our economy. By investing in clean energy, we can create thousands of good-paying jobs in our state while protecting our iconic landscapes. The investments outlined in this new framework present a clear opportunity for Arizona, and businesses like mine, to continue leading in the clean energy industry, and I encourage Congress to pass this bill and provide a jolt to our economy at the most critical time." [Statement, 10/28/21]
"American solar manufacturers are ready to help America pass the Climate Test and ensure our clean energy future is built at home. We're at a pivotal moment to accelerate the growth of the clean energy economy and to re-shore every step of the solar supply chain. With the Build Back Better Act, we can make sure that manufacturing workers in Georgia and around the country lead the world in building the clean energy future. The Build Back Better Act has the potential to be transformative—creating millions of clean energy jobs, reducing energy bills, and transforming how we power the planet for generations to come." [Statement, 10/28/21]
"I applaud the Build Back Better framework released this morning. The hard-earned agreement calls for $1.75 trillion to make historic investments in combating climate change, strengthening our caregiving infrastructure, expanding affordable health care, and creating millions of good jobs — all while cutting costs and taxes for the middle class. Just days before President Biden heads to Glasgow for COP26, this morning's announcement allocates $555 billion to build a 21st century clean energy economy, the country's largest ever investment in climate action. The framework's investments are fully paid for with nearly $2 trillion in revenue-raising proposals, including closing the tax gap and ensuring the country's largest corporations contribute their fair share. I encourage Congress to move forward with the Build Back Better framework — along with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act — as soon as possible." [Statement, 10/28/21]
