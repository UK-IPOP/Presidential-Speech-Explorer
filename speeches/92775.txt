The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced its California Congressional District Chairs. The Congressional District Chairs join other California supporters helping spread Rudy's message of fiscal conservatism and strong leadership throughout the state.
"Rudy is proving to be the Republican candidate best positioned to win in California," said Giuliani's California State Chairman Bill Simon. "It is important to have local and grassroots leadership to turn out supporters and that is exactly what the campaign is accomplishing throughout the state."
Mayor Giuliani campaigned throughout California on Monday and Tuesday with stops in the San Francisco Bay area, Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego.
