Here's How Much Donald Trump Wants to Raise the Price of Products You Buy

 


Trump advertises his tariffs as a cure-all that would create jobs and economic stability. But we know from recent history — like when the U.S. imposed large tariffs on car tires — that these kinds of tariffs create few jobs and jack up prices.

The same results are inevitable under Trump's proposals except, because he wants to raise prices on so many more goods, they'd mean higher prices for even more Americans.










In other words, Americans would see prices on key big-ticket items like cars and electronics jump by more than 25 percent. Can you imagine the bite that will take out of the paychecks of working Americans that Donald Trump claims to protect?

Marco believes American leaders should approach trade in a way that puts our economy and American workers first — for example, by making sure other countries we trade with are playing by the rules. But in the 21st century, imposing sizeable tariffs — essentially huge new sales taxes — is one of the worst things our next president could do for American families and workers. Moreover, such high tariffs probably wouldn't even bring jobs back here; they would likely just push production to a country we haven't put a tariff on.
