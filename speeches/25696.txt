THIS MORNING I received Ambassador Dobrynin and talked with him for 45 minutes. The Ambassador brought me a first message from the new Soviet Government. The message stated the desire of the Soviet Government to continue in seeking for steps toward a more solid peace.
I told the Ambassador that I welcomed this assurance and that the Soviet Government and all governments could rely on the determination of the United States to persevere steadfastly in its own proven determination to serve the cause of peace and international understanding.
I reviewed the developments which have occurred in relations between the Soviet Government and the West in recent years and expressed the purpose of the United States to continue in the quest for peace.
