The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal – a once-in-a-generation investment that will create millions of jobs, modernize our infrastructure, and tackle the climate crisis – passed the House and now heads to President Biden's desk for his signature.
For far too long, Washington policymakers have celebrated "infrastructure week" without ever following through. The American people made it clear: we need to deliver. The President and Congressional Democrats proved we can.
Faith leaders praised the President and the lawmakers who worked across the aisle to pass the historic legislation, which will make a real impact in communities across the country, and put us on a path to win the economic competition for the 21st century.
"The infrastructure act, with its focus on a clean environment, jobs, and expanded internet access, takes important steps toward making the economy work for everyone. Many people Catholic Charities serves, such as senior citizens, persons with disabilities, and people living in rural areas, will experience a major improvement in their standard of living with access to telehealth and education programs through expanded broadband."
