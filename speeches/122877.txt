Jeb has always demonstrated a strong commitment to transparency.
In January, Governor Bush released 280,000 emails from his time as governor, and he's set to release an ebook capturing his tenure. Just two weeks into his candidacy, Governor Bush released 33 years of tax returns, more than any other presidential candidate in history.
Now, he's going above and beyond the existing campaign finance disclosure requirements, which only require disclosure of federally registered lobbyists who have raised a minimum of $17,600 during a covered period. Using this requirement as a benchmark for transparency, Governor Bush has chosen to release the following list of volunteer fundraisers who have raised a minimum $17,600 for the Jeb 2016 primary election. Unlike other candidates, Jeb will continue to run a campaign in the spirit of transparency, and we are incredibly grateful for the dedication and support from the individuals mentioned below.
