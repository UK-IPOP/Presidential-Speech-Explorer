The Administration supports the overall purpose of S. 358, which represents significant advances in legal immigration reform. However, several Administration concerns remain. The Administration would support S. 358 if it:

The Administration continues to have questions about the point system for independent immigration contained in S. 358. The Administration intends to work with Congress to revise or find alternatives to the proposed point system. In addition, the Administration will work with Congress to address other issues and technical financing concerns.

The Administration would oppose any amendment to S. 358 which would permit certain non-immigrant aliens from the People's Republic of China to apply for permanent resident status. At this time, such an amendment would be premature. The Administration's Deferral of Enforced Departure Program provides sufficient protection to any Chinese who fear return to China over the next year. No Chinese will be forced to return to China against their will under that program.
