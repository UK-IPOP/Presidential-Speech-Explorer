Dear__________:
I am attaching for the information of your Committee copies of a letter which I wrote to Secretary of Defense Lovett, and his reply thereto, on the subject of voting by servicemen. The Secretary of Defense indicates in his letter of April 30, 1952, that "unfortunately, the majority of the States whose laws do not comply with the recommendations of the present Federal Voting Law, do not convene their legislatures during 1952. Therefore, the prospect for State action this year does not appear to be optimistic." Under these circumstances, it is even more important that the Congress take early action to enable hundreds of thousands of servicemen to vote this year.

I hope that your Committee will give early consideration to S. 3061 (H.R. 7571), the servicemen's voting bill, which is designed to enable those who are defending our form of Government with their lives to exercise one of the basic rights of American citizens-the right to vote.

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
