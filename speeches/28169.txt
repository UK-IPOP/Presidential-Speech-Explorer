Dear Hamer:
It is with special regret that I accept your resignation as Chairman and a Member of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the hope that my request will not seriously interfere with your plans for the future, I would, however, ask you to defer your departure until after the present Congress has concluded its work.
The dedication and the outstanding ability which have distinguished your years with the Commission have earned the gratitude of every one of our fellow citizens many times over. Your service has added to the finest traditions of government, and you are leaving to your successors exceptional standards of integrity, keen judgment, and far-seeing concern for the interests of all Americans.
Together with the appreciation of the nation, I want to express my own personal thanks for the splendid job you have done. Knowing you as I do, I am confident that in the years ahead your activities will continue to reflect great credit on our country as on yourself.

With warm personal regards,

Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
[Honorable Hamer H. Budge, Chairman, Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington, D.C. 20549]
