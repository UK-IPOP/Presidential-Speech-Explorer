 Good morning. I just had a breakfast with my nominee to be the Secretary of Defense, Bob Gates. Bob Gates will be a fine Secretary of Defense. I appreciate the fact that he's getting a hearing today in the United States Senate. I hope for a speedy confirmation so he can get sworn in and get to work.
Those who wear the uniform know they'll have a friend in Bob Gates in the Defense Department. He admires our military; he respects those who have volunteered to serve our country. He's going to do an excellent job for us.
Again, Bob, I thank you for agreeing to serve.
 Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you very much.
 Best of luck up there on Capitol Hill. Good luck to you.
 Thank you.
 Thank you all.
