 On Tuesday, March 6, President Bush signed an Executive Order to establish this Commission, which will conduct a comprehensive review of the care America is providing our wounded servicemen and women returning from the battlefield.
 Commission members include two veterans wounded in Iraq, the wife of an Army Staff Sergeant wounded in Iraq, the Chairman and CEO of a non-profit that constructs "comfort homes" for families of hospitalized military personnel and veterans, two leaders in the health care industry, and an expert on veterans affairs and military health care.
