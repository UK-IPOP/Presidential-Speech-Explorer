Good Sunday morning from Wilmington.

Call time is at 10am and we just got a lunch lid until noon.

Current schedule: The President has no public events scheduled. 


? Lid extended to 2pm.


We have a travel/photo lid.

Have a good afternoon!

Note that the first two pool reports today should have been labeled #1 and #2, rather than #14 and #15, which picked up where we left off last night. Apologies for any confusion.
