John, Senator Dirksen, General Heaton:
I am pleased that you could come here and meet with us in the Cabinet Room this morning, because I am privileged today to speak for a nation that has always spoken with one voice in affection for a beloved leader.
Dwight David Eisenhower led us bravely in war. He served us devotedly and well in peace. Always he committed the gifts of his heart and the wisdom of his leadership to the strength of America's unity. Throughout his lifetime of duty, he has shown us the qualities that we admire most in our fellow man, the qualities of greatness that run deep in the spirit and the history of America: honor, courage, compassion, integrity. Now we are proud to show him our gratitude and our esteem.
It gives me great pleasure to present this morning to his son, John Eisenhower, the proclamation which sets aside the week of October 13 as America's Salute to Eisenhower Week.
The heartfelt prayer of our people goes with him. God bless you and keep you, Mr. President.
General Heaton, I hope that you and john upon your return to Walter Reed, will say to the General and Mrs. Eisenhower that Mrs. Johnson and I feel that our prayers have been answered and we have been strengthened by the great strength that President Eisenhower has shown in all of these days of trial.
He will always have our affection and our prayers.
