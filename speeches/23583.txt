I WANT to express our great pleasure and satisfaction at having this distinguished choir here. I think they sang for us while we were in Vienna--St. Stephen's Church--and we are delighted to have them here, not only because of their own skill but also because it reminds us of a beautiful city and a very warm welcome.
So we want you to know we are glad to have you at the White House. Thank you.

Are we going to hear from them?
