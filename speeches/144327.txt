At about 8:49 am, King Abdullah arrived at the VP's residence.
VP exited the residence wearing a powder blue pantsuit to greet the King.
The SUV that the King arrived in mostly blocked pool's view of their interaction, until they entered the residence.
As the door was opened could smell breakfast and coffee.
It's 75 degrees and sunny.
Pool is rolling back to the White House.
