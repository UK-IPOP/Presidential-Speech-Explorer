  Speaking through a weak-sounding bullhorn, Rubio did not deny the daunting task ahead.
"If this community doesn't vote tomorrow in historic numbers, I'm not sure I'm going to win," Rubio told the crowd in Spanish.
The West Miami audience cheered on as Rubio talked about a White House kitchen filled with croquetas, cafecito, and a caja china to roast a pig.
"I think he can pull it off. If there's anyone that can pull it off it will be Marco Rubio," supporter Luis Valverde said.
