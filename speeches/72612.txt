The Administration supports the goal of H.R. 416, which is to establish procedures for Federal agencies to provide an equitable remedy for employees who were mistakenly placed in the wrong retirement system during the transition from the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) to the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS). The Administration, however, strongly opposes the bill as reported by the House Government Reform and Ways and Means Committees. In particular, the bill is problematic for the following reasons:
The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact a mutually acceptable solution to this problem that is consistent with the Administration's proposal, the "Retirement Coverage Error Correction Act," which was transmitted to the Congress on March 4, 1999.
H.R. 416 would affect direct spending and receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary PAYGO estimate indicates that H.R. 416 would increase direct spending by approximately $2 million over the period FYs 1999-2004. (However, as noted above, it would substantially increase Federal agencies? discretionary spending on personnel, which would reduce funds available for other priorities.)
