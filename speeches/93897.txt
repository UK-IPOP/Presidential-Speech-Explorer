The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsements of key tribal leaders and members from across America.
"I am proud to support Hillary Clinton," said Chairman Arlan Melendez, Reno-Sparks Indian Colony. "She has the depth of understanding of the challenges facing Indian Country and a plan to address these challenges that we need from the next President. She understands the importance of engaging in dialogue with tribal leaders, and I look forward to working with her as President on health care, education, housing, and other issues."
"I am excited that so many tribal leaders have recognized Senator Clinton's commitment to Indian Country," said Chief Executive Melanie Benjamin of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe Indians. "With her combined record as First Lady and as a U.S. Senator, she has unequivocally proven that she is the best candidate for American Indians."
"I'm honored to have the support of so many leaders in Indian Country," Clinton said. "I look forward to an ongoing dialogue throughout this campaign about how we can ensure that no Americans are invisible to the next President of the United States."
