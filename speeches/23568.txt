Dear Mr. Ngala:
Thank you for your very kind letter regarding American famine relief for Kenya.
The American people were deeply moved by the reports of the suffering caused by the prolonged drought and the recent disastrous floods.
We are most happy to know that our food and assistance were timely and did much to alleviate the intense hardship caused by these disasters. I very much appreciate your thoughtfulness in writing to me on this matter.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
[The Honorable Ronald Ngala, Leader of the House, Nairobi, Kenya]
