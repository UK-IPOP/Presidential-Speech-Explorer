— In a new survey from 
, 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul takes third place, besting Michele Bachmann by 4 percent and trailing the second place candidate, Rick Perry, by the same percentage. The survey was conducted on August 15th and August 16th among New Hampshire Republicans and Republican-leaning independent likely voters. 
This showing continues a trend for Paul, who also led candidate Perry by 4 percentage points in an 
 of likely Iowa caucus goers and is coming off of an impressively close second-place finish in this past weekend's Iowa Straw Poll. Paul has been surging in a number of national polls of late, despite lack of media coverage for his campaign.
"This surge in interest and support for Ron Paul is a direct result of him being the most consistent, trustworthy, and reliable Republican candidate for president," said Ron Paul 2012 Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton. "Our campaign is already doing what we can to capitalize on the momentum we are experiencing, in spite of the media's disregard."
Among top tier candidates in the New Hampshire survey only Paul and Romney have higher favorable to unfavorable ratings among independents, quite possibly proving Paul's ability as a 2012 contender.
