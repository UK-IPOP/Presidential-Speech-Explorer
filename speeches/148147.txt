Earlier this month, President Biden visited Iowa to launch the Building a Better America rural infrastructure tour to highlight his administration's unwavering commitment to ensuring rural communities get the resources they need to thrive. In the weeks since then, Cabinet members, deputy secretaries, and other senior administration officials have crisscrossed the country to over 25 states to meet with, listen to, and deliver infrastructure investments to rural communities.
President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is sending billions of dollars to revitalize and rebuild rural communities across the country. Supporting Americans living in rural areas remains a top priority for the Biden Administration, and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law delivers on the President's promises to provide high-speed internet, safe roads and bridges, modern wastewater systems, clean drinking water, reliable and affordable electricity, and good-paying jobs in every rural community. As part of this effort, the Biden Administration is also committed to working with communities to help them access federal resources and improving transparency. Strong infrastructure in rural communities is good for jobs, good for keeping the economy moving, good for lowering prices, and good for America.
Across the month of April, the White House also made several billion dollars in funding and technical assistance announcements for rural communities, including a

[Sara Wilson, 4/12/22]
Colorado will receive over $18 million this fiscal year from the federal government to treat thousands of acres susceptible to increasingly damaging wildfires, part of a strategy leaders hope will emphasize lowering fire risk before disaster strikes. 
 […] Haaland said the financial investments enabled by last year's bipartisan legislation will facilitate a "collaborative, multi-jurisdictional approach" to reducing wildfire risk. Wildfires, after all, do not discriminate between land managed by the county, private citizens, the Forest Service or the National Park Service, and experts say the best approach is informed by all land managers.

 "We've selected several communities and counties where we know there has been persistently difficult times, high levels of poverty. We know that when you're in those circumstances, it's very difficult to access resources because you just don't know how to play the game," U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Tom Vilsack said. "We're hiring three to five folks in every state. They're going to work with community leaders and they're going to say, 'What's the plan?' 'What's the vision?' What opportunities do you think the federal government could be helpful with? What departments need to be engaged?"

On his second trip to New Hampshire in less than six months, President Joe Biden visited Portsmouth to tout the infrastructure law, using projects taking place in the harbor to make his case. Biden spoke inside a New Hampshire Port Authority warehouse, telling the small crowd of invited guests about how a recently widened ship-turning basin in the river means bigger ships can come and go more easily from Portsmouth Harbor. He said the improvements save the $90,000 per day it otherwise costs an unloaded ship to wait until the tide is right.
