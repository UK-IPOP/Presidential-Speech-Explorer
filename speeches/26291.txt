My dear Mr. Chancellor:
It is a matter of great regret to me that while the Federal Republic and we are pursuing objectives that I believe all mankind shares, namely to live in peace with our neighbors, Berlin is once again threatened.
Our government and yours, along with the British and French, are consulting on this latest totally unprovoked and unjustified aggravation of the situation. I want to express to you on this "Day of German Unity" that our support of free Berlin and the goal of a German people united in peace remains as firm as ever.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[The Honorable Kurt Georg Kiesinger, Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany]
