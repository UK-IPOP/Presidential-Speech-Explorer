[ Released December 2, 1960. Dated November 28, 1960 ]
Dear Mr. President:
I should like to thank you for your very kind message of November nineteenth. The steps taken by the United States Government have enabled us to be in a position to respond to the request received from Your Excellency's Government on November sixteenth for assistance in preventing Communist-directed efforts to intervene in the internal affairs of your country through the landing of armed forces or supplies from abroad. I am gratified to learn that constitutional order is being maintained in Guatemala.
The American people join me in expressing warm good wishes to the Guatemalan people and to Your Excellency personally.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
