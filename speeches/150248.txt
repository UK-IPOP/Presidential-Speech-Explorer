Pool Reports by 
, 
Good morning from Wilmington.
The pool had an OTR conversation with a senior administration this morning for roughly an hour.
We have a 12pm call time but no word on plans for the day.
The pool joined the motorcade outside the Biden residence at 1:28pm.
While we were holding outside the residence, a woman was standing on the side of the road with a large sign that read "#MahsaAmini Joe please support the people of Iran."
We dropped POTUS off at Fieldstone Golf Club at 1:36. The pool has not seen him today.
It's sunny and 70 degrees here after an overcast morning, though rain is forecasted for later today.
We're headed to a hold location.
From the WH:
The President is golfing with Ron Olivere.
The motorcade pulled away from Fieldstone at 3:45pm.
It has been raining since a little after 2:30 and there's a thunderstorm on the radar.
The motorcade reached the president's residence at 3:55.
And we have a lid. Good night!
