 "I would lower taxes as President of the United States because it's not just an ideology or, or a theory for me. I made it work. I had results."
 Giuliani: "I've seen how pro-growth policies lead to broader prosperity. We'll not only keep the current tax cuts in place or their equivalent, we'll enact additional tax relief and give the Death Tax the death penalty. High tax rates hurt business and destroy jobs. I know that tax cuts are good for the economy. It's not just theory for me because I cut taxes and got results as Mayor of New York City. As President, I will cut taxes further."

 "Mayor Giuliani plans to simplify the tax code by introducing the Fair and Simple Tax (FAST) form. The FAST form gives American taxpayers the option of filling out their taxes on a single page, while cutting the current six brackets in half and preserving the major deductions that Americans depend upon – mortgage interest, charity, state & local taxes, the child tax credit, the personal exemption and the new health care exclusion."

 "Sketching a grim portrait of New York City's fiscal condition, a panel appointed by Mayor David N. Dinkins reported yesterday that the city's long-term budget problems were more severe than previously estimated. The committee also outlined what it called a 'menu' of Draconian and politically unpalatable measures — including … increases in the sales tax and in property taxes for single-family homeowners … from which city officials could choose to achieve long-term budget balance. … But Mayor-elect Rudolph W. Giuliani rejected the panel's proposal for tax increases and reiterated his pledge to phase out several business taxes including the hotel tax and the commercial rent tax to spur the local economy." (Alan Finder, "Dinkins Panel Has Grim View Of Fiscal Gaps," The New York Times, 12/3/93)
 "Mayor-elect Rudolph Giuliani was too quick to reject new proposals to end the annual agony of closing New York City's budget gap. … Tax increases are only a fraction of the advisers' proposals, smaller than their recommendations for increased state aid to the city, and smaller still than the proposed spending cuts. But Mr. Giuliani campaigned on the comfortable promise of tax cuts. It would be hard for him to do the reverse at this time, but wise for him to examine his revenue needs and the possibility of delaying reductions until the budget is in better shape." (Editorial, "Budget Advice For The Mayor-Elect," The New York Times, 12/4/93)
 "Toppling liberal bastions isn't easy, but you can get there if you hammer away enough at the ramparts. That at least seems to be the theory of New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and his city council, who this week forced through the first marginal tax cut in memory."
