The Administration opposes S. 2324 unless it is amended to:


— delete the statutory requirement for a specified minimum number of VISTA volunteers each year, because it encroaches on ACTION'S ability to manage the program and would adversely affect funding for service-learning and discretionary grant programs; and

— remove the proposed establishment of a VISTA Literacy Corps, which is an unnecessary, duplicative new program.
