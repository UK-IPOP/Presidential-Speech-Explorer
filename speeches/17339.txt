Dear Rowland:
While I have long been aware that you would not be able to carry on indefinitely as Director of the Budget, it is with deepest regret that I accept the fact that personal obligations compel you to leave Government on April first.
Budgetary responsibilities are always heavy and complex, but those you have carried during the past two years seem to me even more challenging than customary. As you are so well aware, courage, unflagging effort, and broad sympathetic understanding have been indispensable requirements in reestablishing the nation on a strong budgetary foundation--a foundation on which it is possible, for an indefinite time and without resort to borrowing against future generations, to make proper provision for both the nation's security and the advancement of human values so fundamental to our democracy. It is a tribute to your wise judgment and devoted service that we have reached our present reassuring position. You should take vast pride in the balanced budgets now at hand.
I know that the Department and Agency heads with whom you have worked closely throughout this Administration share in the deep feeling of appreciation that I have for your always helpful advice and cooperative spirit. We shall sorely miss your presence in the continuing effort ahead.
To my sincere thanks for your fine contribution I add all best wishes for health and happiness in the future.
With warm regard,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
