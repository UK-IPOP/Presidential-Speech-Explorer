 "Let's start with the first question, how did the President do last night?"
 "Well, I think he advanced the ball last night. I think people recognized that one thing that's unacceptable to this country is that Iraq would become a safe haven for al-Qaeda or other Jihadist terrorist groups. And the fact is that over the last several months, we have seen progress in helping Sunnis respond and react and reject al-Qaeda, and that's critically important."
 


 "The MoveOn.org attack on General Petraeus is, frankly, entirely unacceptable. This is a man who is risking his life by being in Iraq, and being in Camp Liberty, and this is a person who realizes that the lives of many other people are under his care. He's under extraordinary stress. He comes here and reports exactly what he believes is going on â€“ what he thinks ought to be done - and for MoveOn.org to attack him as they did is simply unacceptable and reprehensible. And I frankly don't understand why Hillary Clinton hasn't repudiated MoveOn.org at this point. And I'm afraid the truth is that MoveOn.org has purchased the Democratic Party, if you will. That it's funding, and the status of this 527, and the voice it has in the Democratic Party is so powerful that it's now calling the shots. And that Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama and John Edwards are afraid to repudiate an ad and organization which has taken a disgusting course against a great American."
