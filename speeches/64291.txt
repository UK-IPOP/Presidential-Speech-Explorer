 Mr. President, how did you find Secretary Christopher?
 He was doing well this morning. I had a great talk with him. And he feels good, and he's going to go home with us this afternoon.
 Will he be able to get back to work soon?
 I'm encouraged.
 Would it affect the Mideast trip at all, sir?

 Gee, I hope not. [
