The third night of the Republican National Convention honors American heroes and their contributions to our great American story. President Trump has restored pride in America by honoring those heroes who have strived, achieved, and sacrificed on behalf of their fellow countrymen and women. Accordingly, Wednesday night's theme is "Land of Heroes."

Tonight's speakers, American heroes from all walks of life, will share their incredible stories and how President Trump went out of his way to thank and honor them for their heroism. Americans will hear from Vice President Mike Pence at the conclusion of the evening.
