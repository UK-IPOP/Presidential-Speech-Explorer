When I'm president, there will be no amnesty. I'll cancel Obama's unconstitutional executive orders; cut sanctuary city funding; and deport criminal aliens. We'll add 20,000 border agents; finish all 700 miles of border wall; and if we aren't 100 percent sure who you are and why you're coming to America, you're not getting in.
