The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 3373, but will work in the Senate to delete provisions related to insurance counseling requirements and VA's educational assistance program.



H.R. 3373 would affect direct spending and receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is zero.
