, 
Good morning:
I’m your in-town pool reporter for the day. POTUS is scheduled to travel to Ohio this morning, and Jen is scheduled to brief on the plane. It’s a bright, sunny morning at the White House, and your pool can confirm that there’s a rare (for these parts) black-bellied whistling duck sunning itself down by the pond at Constitution Gardens. Any more serious news, will let you know.
POTUS departed in Marine 1 at 11:35 a.m.
He did not take questions.
Your pool noted Bruce Reed accompanying him, toting a very large backpack. Will send a more complete passenger list shortly.
In keeping with the day’s theme, your pool noted a red-tailed hawk — appeared to be a juvenile— which flew into an evergreen on the South Lawn and perched for a while, seemingly unbothered by the helicopters on the Ellipse.
Traveling with the President to Joint Base Andrews, per press office:
Bruce Reed, Deputy Chief of Staff
Ashley Williams, Deputy Director of Oval Office Operations
Stephen Goepfert, Personal Aide to the President
Brian Deese, Director of the NEC
Jeff Nussbaum, Senior Presidential Speechwriter
That’s all for now. Handing off to the out-of-town pool for the trip to Ohio.
POTUS disembarked from Marine 1 at 5:20 pm, walked the short distance to the waiting motorcade and returned to the White House. No remarks. With that, we have a lid. No additional avifauna sightings of note.

Good morning from Joint Base Andrews, where Marine One just touched down (11:45am) with POTUS and traveling staff (names to follow).
We’re heading to Cleveland shortly, where the president will tour Cuyahoga Community College and deliver remarks on his proposals to juice the post-pandemic economic recovery. Follow along here:
Press Secretary Jen Psaki will also gaggle with reporters onboard AF1 at noon, and you can stream the audio via the WH:
Feel free to reach out to me directly with any questions. I’ll pass along background and color throughout the day, and apologies in advance for the inevitable autocorrect/typos along the way.
SCHEDULE:
 
... and passing along from WH:
The 
provided 
 to colleges and universities to help them through the public health crisis, including providing emergency aid to students, so schools could safely operate and students could stay enrolled.
The 
calls for 
 to provide the following:
· 
: Two years of free tuition at a community college for students seeking a certificate or degree.
· 
:Over $1,400 increase to the maximum Pell Grant award. The discretionary budget also calls for a $400 increase in the maximum grant, which together would be about a 28% increase, putting the program on a path to doubling the maximum grant within four years per the President’s campaign commitment.
· 
: $62 billion for a new fund for evidence-based practices to increase college completion for schools serving high numbers of low-income students, including community colleges. This could include academic tutoring, child care, and transportation funding. And, the AFP would provide affordable child care to low-and middle-income families and access to free, high-quality preschool for all three- and four-year-old children. Not only does this help parents attend and complete education and training programs, investments in child care and preschool help build the workforce for tomorrow – research shows preschool increases children’s college attendance and completion.
· 
: $39 billion to reduce tuition at four year Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and minority-serving institutions (MSIs), plus $7 billion for institutional grants.
The 
calls for:
· 
: $12 billion for infrastructure investments for community colleges, including upgrading existing physical and technological infrastructure and new construction.
· 
:$100 billion to bolster and transform the workforce development system in support of the transformational investments in AJP designed to create millions of good jobs. This includes:
o $9 billion for 
 that build capacity to deliver job training programs based on in-demand skills (similar to the Obama-Biden program).
o $40 billion to build 
 between community colleges (and other training providers), employers, and unions to train millions of workers for the high-growth jobs of the future while providing comprehensive supportive services like child care and income support to 
 to enable their participation in these programs. 
 would support the job creation programs in the AJP (clean energy, infrastructure, caregiving, manufacturing).
o $10 billion for Registered 
. The plan includes creating one to two million new Registered Apprenticeship slots and strengthening the pipeline to these opportunities by increasing access to successful pre-apprenticeship programs such as those funded by the Department of Labor’s Women in Apprenticeships in Non-Traditional Occupations grants.
o $10 billion for the 
, prioritizing increased access to computer science and career pathway programs that connect underrepresented students to STEM and in-demand sectors through partnerships with community colleges, union-sponsored training (pre-apprenticeships), and employers.
o $1 billion for 
. The plan would connect job-seeking adults to employment opportunities by focusing on foundational skills and embedding career services in the adult education system.
Ohio’s infrastructure received a 
 grade on its Infrastructure Report Card. The AJP will make historic investments in our nation’s infrastructure:
· 
: In Ohio, there are 1,377 bridges and over 4,925 miles of highway in poor condition. The AJP will devote more than $600 billion to transform our nation’s transportation infrastructure, including $115 billion repairing roads and bridges.
· 
: Ohioans who take public transportation spend an extra 75.9% of their time commuting, and non-White households are 6.2 times more likely to commute via public transportation. 16% of trains and other transit in the state are past useful life. The AJP will make an $85 billion investment in public transit.
· 
From 2010 to 2020, Ohio has experienced 29 extreme weather events, costing the state up to $10 billion in damages. The administration is calling for $50 billion to improve the resiliency of our infrastructure and support communities’ recovery.
· 
 Over the next 20 years, Ohio’s drinking water infrastructure will require $13.4 billion in additional funding. The AJP includes a $111 billion investment to ensure clean, safe drinking water is a right in all communities.
· 
: 681,000 renters in Ohio are rent burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on rent. The administration is proposing investing over $200 billion to increase housing supply.
· 
: Almost 6.2% of Ohioans live in areas where, by one definition, there is only one internet provider with broadband infrastructure that provides minimally acceptable speeds and nearly 14% do not have an internet subscription. The AJP will invest $100 billion to bring universal, reliable, and affordable coverage to every family.
· 
: Across the country, hundreds of thousands of older adults and people with disabilities need home- and community-based services. This plan will invest $400 billion to help more people access care and improve the quality of caregiving jobs.
· Over 
 in Coronavirus State Fiscal Recovery Funds to Ohio that can be used to respond to acute pandemic-response needs, fill revenue shortfalls, and support the communities hardest-hit by the COVID-19 crisis.
· More than 
 
 in Local Fiscal Recovery Funds to Ohio governments at the local and county levels.
· Nearly 
 in Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief funds to support their efforts to reopen K-12 schools safely and equitably expand opportunity for students who need it most.
· More than 
 in Higher Education Emergency Relief Funds provided by the ARP to support community colleges and low-income students.
· Approximately 
 in funds to provide a lifeline to Ohio childcare providers and early childhood educators, help families with the greatest need access to affordable care, and help parents get back to work.
· ARP allocated roughly 
 to support Emergency Rental Assistance programs that will aid renters, prevent evictions and help Ohioans transition to secure housing.
· Roughly 
 in Homeowner Assistance Funds to prevent mortgage delinquencies and defaults, foreclosures, and displacement.
POTUS hopped off M1 at 11:47am and walked toward AF1. He shook hands and spoke with one of the greeters for 2 minutes before walking over to the press.
Took questions for roughly 3 minutes.
"I haven't had the chance to go over the details of the" GOP counter infrastructure proposal ... will have more to share soon
He briefly talked to Sen. Capito and said he would meet with negotiators next week before stressing the need to get this "done" soon.
He pledged to release the results of the 90-day lab leak review upon completion unless there's something he's "not aware of."
The budget will be released tomorrow
POTUS boarded at 11:51am
More to follow... check with tv footage please
Taxiing as of 11:55am... Cleveland bound. --
A big thanks to VOA's Patsy Widakuswara for capturing audio of POTUS' quick q&a:
Tech difficulties prevented your pooler from transcribing en route, apologies, but sending full quotes at some point today
Press Sec Jen Psaki released the following statement on Republicans' infrastructure counterproposal shortly before takeoff
"We are grateful for the work of Senator Capito and her colleagues on this proposal. It is encouraging to see her group come forward with a substantially increased the funding level—nearing $1 trillion. We appreciate the hard work that went in to making this proposal and continuing these negotiations. Senator Capito told the President that her team would provide us with more details later today, and we look forward to getting that information. At first review, we note several constructive additions to the group's previous proposals, including on roads, bridges and rail. At the same time, we remain concerned that their plan still provides no substantial new funds for critical job-creating needs, such as fixing our veterans' hospitals, building modern rail systems, repairing our transit systems, removing dangerous lead pipes, and powering America's leadership in a job-creating clean energy economy, among other things. Lastly, we are concerned that the proposal on how to pay for the plan remains unclear: we are worried that major cuts in COVID relief funds could imperil pending aid to small businesses, restaurants and rural hospitals using this money to get back on their feet after the crush of the pandemic.
As for the path forward, the President called Senator Capito thank her for the proposal, and to tell her that he would follow-up after getting additional detail. We are also continuing to explore other proposals that we hope will emerge. Though there are no votes in Congress next week, we will work actively with members of the House and Senate next week, so that there is a clear direction on how to advance much needed jobs legislation when Congress resumes legislative business during the week of June 7."

AF1 touched down at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport at 12:54pm.
1 note... Press Sec’s gaggle started at 12:39pm and lasted for roughly 13 min. She talked briefly about Republicans’ counterproposal, the G7, the 90-day COVID review, and tomorrow’s budget release although gave no details.
Passing along from the WH
As of the end of March about 95 % of the $3 trillion in pre-Rescue COVID relief funding has either been obligated or is for PPP, unemployment insurance or nutrition assistance. Of the remaining 5% the largest categories of unobligated balances are in the Heath Care Provider Relief Fund—funding for rural hospitals, health care providers and disaster loans for small businesses.
POTUS deplaned at 1:04pm and spoke with Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur for five minutes before jumping in the Beast.
Pool is loading in the vans and preparing to roll to Cuyahoga Community College.
From the WH:
Greeting the President on the tarmac at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport:
· Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur (D-OH-9)
New WH clarification on COVID relief statement: "Sorry, to double clarify – it is just pre-ARP. The original line is accurate."
And here's the transcript of Biden's Q&A from JBA.
"One of the things I want to tell you is I haven't ha a chance yet to go over the detail of the counteroffer made by Capito. They're going, we're going to meet sometime next week, and we'll see if we can move that, and I 'll havre more to say about that in time."
"If I knew that I wouldn't ask for a 90-day review. I don't know.
"Yes, unless there's something I'm unaware of
"I had a good conversation, very brief, but a good conversation with Capito, Senator, and I told them we to contact me next week. I told her we have to finish this very soon, and there's another Republican group that also wants to talk. But we're going to have to close this down soon."

She did not raise NordStream
We're now holding for POTUS' tour
POTUS' tour stops at a demonstration of a robotic arm used in training students and a 3D printing demonstration.
The president asked how long it takes students to receive certification and was informed it can be accomplished in as little as one semester. The program itself is part of "Smart Manufacturing."
Pool was shuffled through secondary viewing locations and could not get a good ear on some pleasantries POTUS exchanged with students taking part in the demonstrations.
POTUS specifically asked how long it took to create some of the 3D printed sculptures on the wall... "you're doin it," he added while examine some of the products.

There's a number of the administration's "Blue Collar Blueprint for America" signs posted along the room's perimeter and at least 4 American flags within pool's line of sight.
Your pooler guesstimates there are around 100 people in the room once you include attendees, press, faculty, traveling staff, and all others.
Shilaah Patterson, a Cuyahoga Community College student, is now speaking on her experience with the school ahead of POTUS' remarks.
Passing along more background on the tour from WH

Follow along live here: 
POTUS wrapped at 3:01pm.
His remarks echoed similar speeches, particularly in terms of modernizing US infrastructure as a means of competing with China, EU and others: "We must be number one" if we want to lead the world in the 21st century...
One additional noteworthy moment from the speech... Biden pulled out a "list" of Republicans who didn't vote for his American Rescue Plan but are still "taking credit" for its results: "I mean, some people have no shame..."
Pool is holding for further instructions. We're scheduled to head back to the airport at 3:40pm.
More to come...
Motorcade is heading back to the airport as of 3:05pm. --
Passing along from WH...
From Press Secretary Jen Psaki:
The American Rescue Plan is working exactly as intended – delivering relief to families, businesses, and communities to bridge our economy to the end of the pandemic and into a strong recovery. Tax cuts and assistance of over $900 billion have either already gone out (such as the direct payments), are currently going out to workers and families, or will be disbursed as planned. Small businesses have applied or are applying for around $75 billion in relief funds and tax credits. Finally, major provisions of the law for state and local governments, K-12 schools, higher education institutions, and child care providers have been almost entirely allocated. Local governments, schools, and other entities are already budgeting for this year and beyond with these funds.
A big shoutout to Doug Mills, who snagged a picture of Biden's list of 13 GOP members who voted against the ARP but still touted it back home, referenced in previous report:
Motorcade is now driving through a residential area for an unscheduled stop... More to follow
From the WH
The President is making a stop at Honey Hut Ice Cream.
POTUS chatted with workers at the ice cream shop and asked a group of supporters what they usually order... one of the workers cut him off, saying "Mr. President, it's already taken care of"
His order: "chocolate, chocolate chip" and "butter pecan"
POTUS told the shop to keep the change on his order; and one employee called it her best day of work ever
OF NOTE: a very angry person was yelling at Biden and press as we walked back to vans... "f**k you, motherf*****s! ... c**ksuckers!"
The angry person also repeatedly yelled slurs for Black and gay people at the press and WH staff
We're back in the vans as of 3:24pm and now heading to the airport
Motorcade arrived at Cleveland Hopkins Int'l at 3:37pm
POTUS was climbing up the AF1 steps as pool exited the vans at 3:41pm

Taxiing as of 3:47pm ... JBA bound
One other note... POTUS purchased 50 units of ice cream for staff from Honey Hut
We touched down at 4:47pm
Little surprise: Jen Psaki came back and delivered some ice cream from Honey Hut to the press. We determined the flavors to be Butter Pecan and (possibly) Orange Blossom.
National Economic Council Dir. Brian Deese also came back and spoke to us OTR during the flight.
POTUS walked down the AF1 steps at 4:59pm before heading toward M1 and boarding at 5:01pm
