Mitt Romney today announced the support of leaders from Pennsylvania. "I am honored to have the support of these important leaders in Pennsylvania," said Mitt Romney. "Pennsylvania will be a critical state in this election. Voters there have been hurt by President Obama's economic policies. I look forward to partnering with these leaders in my efforts to defeat President Obama in 2012." Announcing his support, former Pennsylvania Republican Party Chairman Alan Novak said, "Mitt Romney has the conservative leadership experience and business acumen to get our nation's economy back on track. He will restore trust, confidence and certainty that the public and business leaders do not feel now and he will reverse the crushing onslaught of federal regulatory overreach that is smothering our economic recovery." "Mitt Romney has demonstrated throughout his life that he has the leadership to turn around struggling enterprises â€“ right now our economy needs a turnaround," said Philadelphia Regional Port Authority Chairman Charlie Kopp. "He has laid out a plan for economic renewal that puts conservative principles and economic know-how to work. I look forward to working with him as he brings this pro-growth message to Pennsylvania voters."
