The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.J. Res. 83. The resolution would nullify the final rule titled "Clarification of Employer's Continuing Obligation to Make and Maintain an Accurate Record of Each Recordable Injury and Illness," 81 Fed. Reg. 91792 (Dec. 19, 2016) promulgated by the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The rule purports to clarify OSHA's recordkeeping requirements by allowing OSHA to cite employers for up to five years for failing to make and maintain injury and illness records. The Administration is committed to reducing regulatory burdens on America's businesses, and this rule imposes costs on employers resulting from continuing recordkeeping obligations.
