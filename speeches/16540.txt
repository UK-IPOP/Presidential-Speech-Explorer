With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to ratification, I transmit herewith a certified copy of the Inter-American Convention on the Granting of Political Rights to Women, formulated at the Ninth International Conference of American States, and signed at Bogota, Colombia, on May 2, 1948, by the plenipotentiaries of the United States of America and by the plenipotentiaries of other American Republics.
I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report which the Acting Secretary of State has addressed to me in regard to this convention.
The purpose of this convention, and the principle underlying it, have my complete and wholehearted approval and I am happy to recommend the convention to the favorable consideration of the Senate.
