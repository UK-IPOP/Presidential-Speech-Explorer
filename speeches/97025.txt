 General O'Dell is passionate about the revitalization of the Gulf Coast region. His established credibility and proven leadership skills in New Orleans, as well his military record and business acumen, make him an ideal selection to take over for Donald Powell as Gulf Coast Coordinator.
 General O'Dell was headquartered in New Orleans when Hurricane Katrina made landfall in 2005, as the commanding General of the 4th Marine Division. General O'Dell employed 2,700 Marines and Sailors and assisted in rescuing and evacuating more than 2,000 civilians, providing more than one million pounds of essential cargo, and restoring basic functions to more than 30 buildings, including churches. Additionally, with the impending landfall of Hurricane Rita, he embarked 1,000 of his Marines on available amphibious shipping and followed the storm's path, thereby allowing his troops to commence relief operations within hours of the storm's passage.
 General O'Dell is well regarded in the Gulf Coast Region.
 General O'Dell left active duty in 1974 but was activated several times over the course of his military career.
 During his tenure, General O'Dell organized, trained, equipped, and deployed nine battalions, a division advisory group, and numerous supporting elements to combat operations in Iraq.
 Starting in 1988, General O'Dell served as Regional Vice President for AIM investments. He was named a Partner in 1993 and ultimately retired on September 10, 2001. General O'Dell entered the Marine Corps through the Platoon Leaders Class in March 1968 and completed The Basic School at Quantico.
