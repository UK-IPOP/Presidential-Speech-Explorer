The Administration supports enactment of H.R. 1643.



H.R. 1643 could affect receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is zero. Final scoring of this proposal may deviate from this estimate.
