Dear Mr. Chairman:
In my signing statement on S. 2395, the bill providing early retirement for railroad workers, I informed the Congress of my serious concern over the financial conditions of the railroad retirement and unemployment compensation systems. I know you, and the other members of the Board, share my concern in this matter, and I noted with satisfaction your recent statement to Chairman Harris during the hearings on this legislation that the Board would take up its responsibilities to keep the system financially sound,
I also indicated to the Congress my hope that we might soon have some recommendations designed to remedy the financial situation of these systems. Accordingly I would like you to undertake immediately a review of the situation and to develop recommendations which I can consider for presentation to the Congress.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
[Honorable Howard W. Habermeyer, Chairman, Railroad Retirement Board, 44 Rush Street, Chicago II, Illinois]
