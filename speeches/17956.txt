President and Madame Bayar:
It is a great privilege to speak for the American people and the Nation's Government in bidding you welcome here to the Capital.
On the personal side, Mrs. Eisenhower and I are very proud to have you, the Head of the great and friendly State of Turkey, as guests at the White House.
