Marine1 was wheels down at the Delaware Air National Guard Base in New Castle at about 4:28 p.m.
POTUS walked off at 4:33 p.m.
After descending the short staircase, he saluted and turned to help FLOTUS step off.
Both waved to the pool, but did not come over to answer questions, before getting into their vehicle.
We are rolling at 4:37 p.m.
The pool broke away from POTUS near his residence at about 4:52 p.m. after an uneventful drive from the airport. A few people, including 2 very enthusiastic little girls, waved at the motorcade as we passed.
We have a lid.
