My dear Mr. Gifford:
I have your letter of August 5th and deeply regret that the time has expired during which you undertook to make the sacrifice entailed by directing national coordination of unemployment relief agencies. I recognize full well the difficulties it has imposed on you amongst your other duties and obligations and I cannot, of course, ask you to continue over the coming winter.
I do wish to take this occasion to express the appreciation I have, and that I know the whole of our people have, for the notable contribution to public service you have made during these difficult times.
I am greatly indebted for your willingness to be helpful in an advisory and consulting capacity in setting up coordination work for next winter and will depend upon you. Early in the fall we shall be able to see more clearly the problems before us, and the measures of coordination which will be required for the winter. I trust the national and state members will hold fast.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
