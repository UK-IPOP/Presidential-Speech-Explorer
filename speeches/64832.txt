The Administration is committed to ensuring the efficient management of the Federal oil and gas program and to finding new ways for the States to work cooperatively and creatively with the Federal Government. Accordingly, the Administration strongly supports enactment of H.R. 1975 if amended to adopt the language of S. 1014, as reported by the Senate, with the technical amendment agreed upon by the Administration and the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. The Senate reported bill maintains Federal discretion in delegating royalty collection and other duties to States while expanding the list of delegable authorities that a State may seek.
