THE REDUCTION in rates for electricity used by farmers and other rural residents is as significant as a gain in rural income. The objective of the REA program throughout its existence has been to achieve parity of electric service and costs between city and country. I am gratified that the cooperatives are applying their resources and growing skills to keep faith with this important objective and purpose of our rural electrification program.
