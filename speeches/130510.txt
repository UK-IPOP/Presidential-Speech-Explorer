"Mick Mulvaney is the absolute right choice. In Congress, he has been a conservative reformer from day one, proposing solutions to fix the budget process and our regulatory system. At OMB, he will lead the work he has started to improve the way government does the people's business. Mick is someone I have come to greatly respect and rely on, going back to our time serving together on the Budget Committee. I look forward to working with Mick in his new role, and I commend President-elect Trump on this excellent selection."



"Mick is a great choice to lead the OMB. We entered Congress together in 2011, and I am certain he will tackle this new position with the same passion he has represented the 5th District with over the past six year. Facing a $20 trillion debt, we need someone committed to restoring fiscal sanity in Washington, and I am confident Mick will work to do so."



"Mick is a great choice for OMB Director. I've often described him as "young" Paul Ryan when it comes to all things budget-related. He's done his homework when it comes to the federal budget and will hit the ground running in this very important job.



"To root out government waste, make government more efficient, and address the debt, Congress needs a willing partner in the administration. I look forward to working with Mick Mulvaney as budget director to meet those goals."



"Very pleased that my friend and great conservative leader @RepMickMulvaney named @realDonaldTrump Budget Director. Outstanding choice!" (Twitter)



"Rep. Mulvaney is the perfect person to lead the Office of Management and Budget. Mick is incredibly bright and capable, and I have no doubt his conservative principles will help restore our nation's fiscal health. I look forward to seeing him serve in this new role.

"Mick has been an incredible colleague over the past six years. I will miss working with him on a daily basis as we all missed Tim when he went to the Senate. But I am happy for Mick, Pam and their three children as they embark on a new and exciting period of service to our country and state."



"Congressman Mulvaney's appointment to be the next Director of the Office of Management and Budget is bittersweet for me. Mick and I have been colleagues since we served together in the South Carolina General Assembly and were elected to Congress at the same time. We've fought together, prayed together, and even played (not always our best) baseball together. With Mick leaving Congress, we are losing one of our most talented and articulate voices on the budget and limited government matters. While I will miss serving in Congress with Mick, I am glad to know that he will be serving our country in an even greater capacity as Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

"Mick Mulvaney knows the budget backwards and forwards. He and I have joined together over the years to support multiple budgets, which would have remarkably improved our country's fiscal situation had they been adopted. I congratulate Mick on this wonderful opportunity, and I look forward to doing everything I can to ensure he's successfully confirmed."

"I want to sincerely congratulate a great man and House Freedom Caucus colleague, Rep. Mick Mulvaney, on his new position as Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Mick has been a personal friend of mine for years, and through our time of service together in the House, I have come to know him as one of the most principled and sharp-minded conservatives in Congress. There is no better choice than Mick Mulvaney to make the tough financial decisions our country needs right now.

"President-elect Donald Trump has made an outstanding choice in naming Mick Mulvaney Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and I believe his selection demonstrates the President-elect's commitment to restoring fiscal accountability in Washington. Since the first day I met Mick, he has been a man who has been guided by principle. He is a tireless advocate for the American taxpayer, and he is always willing to take on the tough fights in pursuit of what he feels is right. Mick has worked with me side-by-side on the Financial Services Committee for years, and he has not only been a strong ally but a true friend. I look forward to working with him in his new role as OMB director to help end Washington's spending problem and as President-elect Trump said, 'save our country from drowning in red ink.'"
