THANK YOU, Mr. Secretary. I don't know when I have had a more pleasurable occasion. I made a speech about these young men this morning, and I hope they will be able to read it, because what I said then will be much better than what I can say now, and will completely cover the situation.
I congratulate them on their service to freedom and against aggression in the world.
This is a cross section of what the United Nations is trying to do. We all are highly pleased that you could come to see us. I hope you have an enjoyable trip around the United States of America, and carry back home a good impression of us.
I am sorry that the weather prevented us from holding the meeting where we usually do, out here in the Rose Garden, but it is just a little damp, and I don't think it would look well for all of us to be wearing raincoats.
Enjoy yourselves all you can now. You are highly welcome to this country, and as I said, I hope you will go back feeling kindly towards us.
Have a good time now, and if there's anybody around the country that doesn't treat you right, why you tell me!
