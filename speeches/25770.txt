PRESIDENT JOHNSON today noted the fifth anniversary of Statehood for Hawaii by hailing the Nation's newest State as "a symbol to people everywhere of what it is possible to achieve within the American system of Government."
The President observed that Hawaii's five years of Statehood have been marked by unprecedented growth and prosperity and he called attention to the fact that in this period it has risen from 22d in per capita income to 17th among the 50 States.
The President also applauded Hawaii for its position on civil rights.
The President disclosed that the Bureau of the Budget has determined that 285 additional acres of U.S. Government property on the island of Oahu in Hawaii are no longer needed by the Federal Government and arrangements are being made to transfer title to the State. All the land being returned to the State was originally donated to the United States by Hawaii.
