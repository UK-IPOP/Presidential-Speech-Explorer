The partnership between Peace Corps and VSO will leverage the resources of both organizations to improve the lives of poor and marginalized people, and to promote the value of volunteering in global development. Peace Corps and VSO will harness complementary strengths, share knowledge and collaborate on key development interests, building on our nations' shared history of volunteerism.



Peace Corps and VSO are leading global organizations that fight poverty by using the power of people and volunteers to bring about lasting change. Both organizations are founded on an approach that puts people first, and fosters capacity building and knowledge exchange in a way that transforms poor and marginalised communities worldwide. Peace Corps and VSO's joint network of almost 10,000 currently serving volunteers in nearly 95 countries, combined with an alumni base of more than 250,000 former volunteers, will enhance global volunteerism efforts and create lasting change.



Peace Corps and VSO have informally collaborated for more than a decade through sharing training resources and collaborating on volunteer site assignments. In line with best practice, the two organizations will capitalize on this joint work, thereby increasing the global impact of their efforts in the more than 25 countries where both organizations currently operate. Volunteers from both organizations will work alongside local communities and organizations on development priorities, as well as supporting them in building a lasting legacy of local volunteerism, that will make a real and sustainable difference to the lives of poor people.
