The President has asked me to communicate to each of you his plan for managing the Federal employment process at the outset of his Administration. As you know, during the campaign, the President expressed his desire to make Government more responsive to the needs of citizens, more efficient, and more accountable. The President articulated his view of an effective Federal Government -- one that is citizen-centered, results-oriented, and characterized by quality of service. To help meet these important goals, the President proposed, among other things, to flatten the Federal hierarchy by redistributing positions and resources from high-level managerial positions to front-line, service delivery jobs.
In order to ensure that, from the start of this Administration, the President's appointees have the opportunity to make personnel decisions consistent with his goals for Government reform, he asks that you institute the hiring control procedures described below.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
I appreciate your cooperation. Together, with prompt and diligent implementation of this memorandum, we can begin to work toward the President's goal of ensuring that his Administration serves the American public in the most efficient and responsible manner possible.
