 Well, thank you very much. It's my great honor to have the Crown Prince of Bahrain in the Oval Office. We're doing a lot of business. They're buying a lot of things. I heard $9 billion is thrown about. So that's a very nice trip, and we appreciate it.

We've had a long relationship and a great relationship, and it will only get better. I can tell you, they've been—and you have been—a great friend. And we appreciate it very much, and we appreciate you being at the White House.

 Thank you, Mr. President.

. Thank you very much.

It's a great honor to be here. This is a very important trip for us. And indeed, we are building on a hundred years of relationship between the Kingdom of Bahrain and the United States of America. And the peoples of both countries have benefited from this relationship, and we continue to seek ways to strengthen that.

And thank you, Mr. President, for honoring me with this meeting.

 It's a great honor, believe me. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody.
