OPPORTUNITIES AND ESTUARY RESTORATION
America is economically stronger when participating fully in the worldwide economy. Ninety-five percent of the world's population lives outside the U.S. and represents a vast potential market for U.S. farmers and businesses. The Office of Management and Budget has now completed its review of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' plan for the Columbia River Channel Deepening Project and found it to be justified; the President will submit to Congress a $15 million amendment to the FY 2005 budget to enable work to begin. The Project will provide national transportation and trade improvements, as well as regional and statewide environmental benefits.
