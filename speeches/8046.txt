Herewith is returned, without approval, S. 750, a bill to amend the act entitled "An act for making further and more effectual provision for the national defense, and for other purposes," approved June 3, 1916, as amended, and for other purposes.
This bill would authorize the appointment of 92 commissioned officers as bandmasters in addition to the number of commissioned officers of the Army new authorized by law. These appointments would be made from band leaders who now hold the grade of warrant officer or from noncommissioned officers or other enlisted musicians who have had at least 10 years' service in Army bauds.
There is no requirement in the military service for leaders of bands to be given a commissioned status. There should be such a requirement before the added cost which this bill contemplates is imposed permanently upon the taxpayer. This bill would increase our military expenses by about $86,090 per year. I would not hesitate to give my approval to this increased cost if it represented some real requirement. The Secretary of War is opposed to this proposed legislation on the ground that it does not serve to meet a need of the military service nor operate to improve that service. In fact it is his opinion that to give commissions to band leaders, thus requiring them to exercise administrative and disciplinary control over the bands, would militate against the musical instruction of the bands, which is now and must always be their main function. I am therefore constrained to return this bill without my approval.
