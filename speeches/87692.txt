 Shenandoah National Park is a strong model for illustrating how the President's FY 2008 budget and the Centennial Initiative will benefit the National Park System. Overall, the President's FY 2008 Parks budget, totaling nearly $2.4 billion, is the largest ever for park operations, and includes the highest increase ever in parks operations funding. For the Shenandoah National Park, this means an increase of nearly $2 million (17 percent) over 2006 levels for park operations, including the hiring of additional seasonal employees, plus more than $2 million in construction to rehabilitate scenic overlooks in the Shenandoah National Park.
 It provides for the potential of up to $3 billion in new funds over the next 10 years:
 This will allow for improvement and expansion of operations throughout the National Park System.
 The National Park System was started with the establishment of Yellowstone National Park on March 1, 1872, and includes areas of historical as well as scenic and scientific importance throughout the United States. The System now comprises 390 areas covering more than 84 million acres in 49 States, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, Saipan, and the Virgin Islands.
