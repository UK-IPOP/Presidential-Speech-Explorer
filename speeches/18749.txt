Mr. President, Senora, ladies and gentlemen:
Ordinarily when we have a visitor, a head of state from abroad, we always express the hope that the friendship between the two peoples we represent will be strengthened by such a visit.
In this case, I think it is a rather futile hope--I do not know how the friendship between our two countries could be stronger, and so I will content myself, Mr. President, by saying that the American people are proud of the friendship of your people for ours. We are grateful for it, and we reciprocate it.
And as a symbol of our affection for the people of Colombia, I ask this company to drink with me a Toast to the President of Colombia and Senora Lleras.
