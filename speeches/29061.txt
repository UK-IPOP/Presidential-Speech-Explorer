I AM DELIGHTED to have this opportunity to join with Carol Burnett in kicking off the Easter Seal Campaign. I think we are very fortunate to have this little girl from Florida here, Donna Kay Howell. I think as you look at Donna and also as you listen to her, you can really see what your Easter Seal contribution will mean.
Through Easter Seals 250,000 children and others are helped each year by volunteers. The $32 million that we raise in this campaign between now and April 6 will help them.
Donna is an example. She suffered a very severe stroke at the age of 4 years. She was paralyzed on one side and her speech was affected by it. Her speech is completely cured, as you have heard already. Beyond that, she still is receiving therapy, but here is a very happy and a very healthy child who might not have been this way had it not been for the Easter Seal programs.
So, I join with Carol Burnett in asking all of the American people to support this volunteer program that gives help to children across the country and lets little girls like Donna grow up and be so happy and so pretty and so talkative.
