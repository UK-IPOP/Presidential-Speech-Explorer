AN OUTSTANDING jurist, who would have brought great credit to the Supreme Court of the United States, has been rejected by the United States Senate.
I deeply regret this action. I believe a majority of people in the Nation regret it.
Especially I deplore the nature of the attacks that have been made upon this distinguished man. His integrity is unimpeachable, his ability unquestioned. The Supreme Court needs men of his legal philosophy to restore the proper balance to that great institution.
The Nation is fortunate that Clement Haynsworth's ability and judgment will remain available to the judiciary through his continuance as Chief Judge of one of the largest and busiest Appellate Courts in the Nation.
When the Congress returns for its second session in January I will nominate another Associate Justice. The criteria I shall apply for this selection, as was the case with my nomination of Judge Haynsworth, will be consistent with my commitments to the American people before my election as President a year ago.
