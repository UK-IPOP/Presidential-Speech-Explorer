AT A CONFERENCE with leaders of the Senate and House the President stated his objections to the form of the relief bill as it now stands. There was general discussion of these objections and a general disposition to meet them and to reach a compromise agreement acceptable to all. In an effort to arrive at a definite conclusion it was agreed that a subcommittee should meet with the President tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock.
