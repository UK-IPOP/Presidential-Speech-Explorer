President Heuss, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Rarely has this house had a greater honor than has come to it this evening in the opportunity to entertain the President of the federal German Republic. Never before has the head of the German state visited this nation.
And so this evening, President Heuss, there are people here who have come to see you because they are old friends; they come here with an affectionate regard for you.
All of us are here in admiration and esteem for the nation of which you are head, and for the characteristics they reveal and you symbolize-their dedication to freedom, to liberty, to the rights of men.
Those are the values that tie this nation to your people so firmly, and we feel especially tonight that it is not only a great honor but a great privilege to ask this company to rise and drink to you a Toast.
