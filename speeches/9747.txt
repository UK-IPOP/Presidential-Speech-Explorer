My dear Mr. Buterly:
I thank you cordially for your invitation to Mrs. Hoover and myself to attend the performance on Tuesday evening, December 27th of the orchestra formed from unemployed musicians in New York. Earlier engagements here will not permit us to attend but I wish you to know of my hearty commendation of this admirable provision by which these artists are enabled to make their livelihood throughout the winter, and in so doing bring to their generous friends and to the public the joys of great music finely rendered. This is indeed a model example of community concern and provision to prevent distress.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. George P. Buterly, Jr., Musicians Symphony Orchestra, 120 E. 41st St., New York City]
