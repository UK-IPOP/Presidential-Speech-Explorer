"After four years of President Obama's failed economic policies, things have only gotten worse for the middle class. Families in Colorado and around the nation are struggling with declining incomes, fewer good-paying jobs, and a shrinking middle class. Americans simply can't afford four more years like the last four years — they deserve a real recovery. Mitt Romney will deliver results for struggling Americans by creating 12 million new jobs, more take-home pay, and a more prosperous future for the next generation." — Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 OBAMA: "But I am running for President because we simply cannot afford four more years of an economic philosophy that works for Wall Street instead of Main Street, and ends up devastating both. I don't want to wake up in four years to find that more Americans fell out of the middle-class, and more families lost their savings."  (Senator Barack Obama,

 "In January 2009, the month President Obama entered the Oval Office and shortly before he signed his stimulus spending bill, median household income was $54,983. By June 2012, it had tumbled to $50,964, adjusted for inflation. (See the chart nearby.)  That's $4,019 in lost real income, a little less than a month's income every year."

 "Lower-paying jobs, with median hourly wages from $7.69 to $13.83, accounted for just 21% of the job losses during the recession. But they've made up about 58% of the job growth from the end of the recession in late 2009 through early 2012." (Jim Puzzanghera, "Majority Of New Jobs In Recovery Are Low-Paying, Study Finds,"

 "The gap between rich and poor Americans grew in 2011 as the poverty rate remained at almost a two-decade high. The U.S. Census Bureau released figures today that showed household income fell, underscoring a sputtering economic recovery that's at the heart of the presidential campaign."
