The Clinton campaign today announced it is airing a television ad in West Virginia highlighting Senator Clinton's commitment to leveling the playing field against special interests and strengthening America's middle class.
The 30-second spot, entitled "Level," comes as voters prepare to head to the polls on May 13th.

Following is the script for the ad.
: She's fighting for America's middle class.
: It's time to level the playing field against the special interests.
: She'll end $55 billion dollars in giveaways to corporate special interests and invest it in middle class tax cuts and creating new jobs. She'll get tough on unfair trade deals and end tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas.
: Standing up for people who weren't getting a fair shake, that's been the purpose of my life. And it will be the purpose of my presidency.
: I'm Hillary Clinton and I approved this message.
