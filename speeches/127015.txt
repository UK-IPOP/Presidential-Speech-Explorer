Senate Majority Leader Terry Bruce says its about expanding the American dream:

I am thrilled that so many influential elected officials, supporters, and young people across Kansas are rallying behind Marco ahead of tomorrow's caucuses. Marco has the ability to inspire the next generation of conservatives and bring more people to the party as he shares his plan to expand the American Dream for future generations, and that's why he is the Republican that Democrats don't want to run against this fall.
Kansans understand that these are serious times and we need a serious leader as Commander-in-Chief. Marco is a proven conservative leader who understands the struggles of working families and the national security challenges we face as a nation, and he will make a wonderful President.
