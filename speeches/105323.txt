Mitt Romney has an integrity problem, as evidenced in the video, "Words Have Meaning"
Mitt Romney is trying to run from the fact that President Obama used Romneycare as the model for Obamacare.
"Mitt Romney may try to edit his past, but he can't - President Obama followed Mitt Romney's model of Romneycare when he designed Obamacare," said Perry spokesman Mark Miner. "Americans are looking for a proven and authentic conservative, not someone who changes his policies based on the 'climate.' "
Consider these facts:
On Fox News last Friday, Mr. Romney's spokeswoman admitted No Apology was changed, attributing the rewrite to "changes in the climate." She also falsely claimed No Apology was written before Obama's $800 billion stimulus was passed, when the truth is the stimulus passed in Feb. 2009 and No Apology was published in March 2010.
