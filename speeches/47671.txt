The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 3302 unless it is amended to:


â€” delete title II, which would establish the 174,000-acre Great Basin National Park from lands within the Humboldt National Forest. The creation of a new National Park is a significant change in management direction for these Federal lands and should be subject to full hearings. Pending such factfinding, the Forest Service will continue its management of the area to conserve and protect the scenic, natural, geologic, historic, and archaeological resources of the area.
