My dear Mr. Strauss:
I have been much interested to learn that you and your associates are continuing the work of the Joint Distribution Committee. I am able to review in memory the period of more than twelve years of its constructive endeavors, many of them in concert with organizations over which I presided.
I trust that the forthcoming national conference of the Joint Distribution Committee will result in continuation of the hearty cooperation and support which have made possible the success that has hitherto accompanied its benevolent activities.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Lewis Strauss, 52 William Street, New York City]
