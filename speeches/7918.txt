THE PLAN of a joint select committee to consider reorganization of Federal agencies for the enforcement of prohibition was agreed upon by the House and Senate leaders many months ago, 
 as a method of securing coordinated action by the several committees involved. Technical difficulties have arisen from the fact that the resolution as passed by the Senate did not permit the direct report of bills from the House Members of the select committee to the House itself, but would have required that even after action by the select committee they would have to be referred to the regular committees of the House. It was considered that to secure the amendment of the Senate proposal would entail delay and the whole question in its present tangle could be expedited by the various committees of the House taking up the proposals directly and immediately.
1 See 1929 volume, Item 112.
The White House has no interest in the question, which is one of parliamentary procedure, and desires only expedition of legislation and will adapt itself entirely to the wishes of the House leaders in any methods they adopt for early consideration of the proposals.
The President will send up the reports of the Law Enforcement Commission on Monday, and place the various administrative officials of the Government at the disposal of the House committees.
