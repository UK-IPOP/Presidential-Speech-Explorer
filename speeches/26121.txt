On March 31, I informed the American people that I would not seek the nomination of my party for another term as President. That decision was and is irrevocable.
I ask therefore that my name not be considered by the Convention. I wish to express my deep appreciation to all those who might have wished me to continue.
During the remaining months of my term as President, and then for the rest of my life, I shall continue my efforts to reach and secure those enduring goals that have made America great--peace abroad and justice and opportunity at home.
