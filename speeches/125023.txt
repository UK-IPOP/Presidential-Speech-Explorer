Here's what you need to know.
Republican candidates talk a big game about fighting terrorism—but bluster isn't enough. Hillary has a detailed plan to keep America safe.
Washington and Silicon Valley need to work together to defeat jihadists in cyberspace. That means identifying and removing the extremist content that terrorists use to recruit online.
We need to know the identity of jihadists and stop them before they cross our border. The United States and its allies need to vigilantly screen visa applicants, share information, and alert each other to potential threats.
Better intelligence is key to intercepting terror plots—but we also have to stop terrorists from carrying them out. That means restoring the assault weapons ban and closing the loopholes that let suspected terrorists buy guns.
We need to make sure our law enforcement officials have the training and resources they need to keep us safe from terrorism. And we can never turn our backs on the heroes who risk their health and their lives for our country.
Demonizing Muslims doesn't just go against everything we stand for as Americans—it also threatens our national security. We need to stand up to disgraceful anti-Muslim rhetoric and build trust so that our communities can work hand in hand with law enforcement to stop terrorism.
