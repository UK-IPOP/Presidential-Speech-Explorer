Mitt Romney announced today that well-known Tennessee leaders and national Republican fundraisers Ted Welch and Jim Haslam will lead fundraising efforts as state chairs for his presidential campaign in the state.
Romney said Haslam and Welch will be joined by a group of other top Republican fundraisers who will serve as State Co-Chairs for Romney's presidential campaign in Tennessee.
That leadership team includes: Brad Martin, former chairman and CEO of Saks, Inc., from Memphis; Orrin Ingram, President and CEO of Ingram Industries, Inc., from Nashville; Joe Davenport, president of Porter Management Company, from Chattanooga; and Jimmy Haslam, president and CEO of Pilot/Flying J, from Knoxville.
"No one has done more to provide resources necessary to build a strong Republican party in Tennessee, and to help elect so many of our nation's top leaders than Jim Haslam and Ted Welch," said Mitt Romney. "And when you have behind you those who helped elect Bill Haslam, Lamar Alexander, Bob Corker, Howard Baker and Bill Frist, as well as President Reagan, and both Presidents Bush, you can't do any better than that. So I am deeply honored and thankful to have their full and active support."
Randy Boyd, founder, chairman and CEO of Radio Systems Corp., from Knoxville; Jerry Sink, senior vice president of CBL & Associates, from Chattanooga; Bob Rolfe, managing partner of West End Holdings, LLC, from Nashville; and Todd Watson, with Armstrong Relocation in Memphis.
The Romney campaign said even more finance leaders will be announced as fundraising events are scheduled and the campaign progresses across the state.
