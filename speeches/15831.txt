Dear Mr. Well:
I heartily approve the present efforts of the President's Committee on Religion and Welfare in the Armed Forces to stimulate community organization on behalf of the men and women of our armed forces.
I know that the American people today feel a great friendship for the individual in the uniform of his country's defense forces. The problem now at hand is to encourage civilians in areas near military installations to translate that friendship into active religious and recreational programs that will encourage each serviceman to participate in the wholesome life of the community.
The predominantly youthful and civilian character of our large peacetime armed forces makes it imperative that all sections of the community join these programs. Churches, synagogues, social welfare groups, veterans organizations, fraternal societies, women's dubs, cultural and entertainment groups, educational interests, labor unions, business associations, civic clubs, municipal government, youth groups--all these and many more ought to open their doors and their hearts to the young servicemen in a strange town,
I am glad that the Committee, with the help of the large private voluntary agencies, is going to take its program to the people in communities near military installations. Once the American people know the facts, they can be counted on to respond with vigor, determination, and eventual success.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Mr. Frank L. Well, Chairman, The President's Committee on Religion and Welfare in the Armed Forces, Washington, D.C.]
