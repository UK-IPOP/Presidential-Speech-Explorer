ARLINGTON, VA -- Today, in Florida, Barack Obama once again demonstrated that his words really don't matter. When discussing NASA programs, Barack Obama said that "it's still being reported" that he would delay the NASA Constellation Program to pay for his early education program. Unfortunately for Barack Obama, that is what he proposed and has been saying for months: 
 OBAMA: "I mentioned this earlier, I want to tell you that, you know, I know it's still being reported that we were talking about delaying some aspects of the Constellation program to pay for our early education program. I told my staff we're going to find an entirely different offset, because we've got to make sure that the money that's going into NASA for basic research and development continues to go there. That has been a top priority for us." (Barack Obama, Remarks, Titusville, FL, 8/208 
 "The early education plan will be paid for by delaying the NASA Constellation Program for five years, using purchase cards and the negotiating power of the government to reduce costs of standardized procurement, auctioning surplus federal property, and reducing the erroneous payments identified by the Government Accountability Office, and closing the CEO pay deductibility loophole. The rest of the plan will be funded using a small portion of the savings associated with fighting the war in Iraq." (Obama For America, "Barack Obama's Plan For Lifetime Success Through Education,"

 BARACK OBAMA: "I think the constellation project is a bold vision but we haven't thought through all the steps to get there and what the funding sources are." (Barack Obama, Interview With
