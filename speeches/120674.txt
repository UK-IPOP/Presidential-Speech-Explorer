Columbia, SC — At a press conference today, Senator Lindsey Graham announced the South Carolina National Security Coalition for his presidential campaign.
The coalition is comprised of retired flag officers, former prisoners of war, current and former adjutants general of the South Carolina National Guard, officers who served with Graham during his 33 year military career, and civilians who have devoted their lives to honoring and serving our veterans. The group will assist the campaign by spreading the Senator's strong national security record to voters in South Carolina, communicating directly with veterans and military families, and explaining why Senator Graham is ready to be Commander-in-Chief on day one.
In addition, Senator Graham returned to the state yesterday where he held campaign events and a 
 town hall meeting to continue to address the bad deal with Iran and our nation's security.
 said Bob Livingston, South Carolina Adjutant General.
