- Mayor Rudy Giuliani
 Rudy proposes establishing a competitive grant process to fund new voucher programs for disadvantaged students—similar to the programs in Cleveland, Milwaukee and Washington, DC—that provide options for students trapped in failing schools.
 Rudy's plan will allow states to use Federal IDEA funds to enable the families of special education students to seek out appropriate placement in both public and private schools.
 Rudy proposes establishing a pilot program to offer scholarships to children of all active-duty military personnel living on or off base to attend private schools or to pay for the costs of attending public schools to which they are not assigned. This is a critical concern for America's military families because it affects reenlistment decisions.
 Rudy commits to the expansion of charter schooling, equitable treatment for charter schools in funding and facilities, and efforts to ensure that local districts are not the sole chartering authorities.
