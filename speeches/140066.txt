 Having confidence in our elections means knowing that votes are legally cast and that voters themselves are legally eligible to cast a ballot.

Americans cannot have confidence in election results unless elected officials, law enforcement authorities, and fair-minded journalists take the issue of voter fraud seriously and investigate potential instances thoroughly. The Trump campaign will continue to bring these allegations to light, and 
.

Here are several examples in Georgia that should be investigated:

Voter records show someone used the identity of 
 to vote in the recent election, even though Mrs. Christiansen passed away in May 2019. Further, someone registered Christiansen to vote on October 5, the day of the deadline to register, more than a year after she passed away. 
ran an obituary announcing Christiansen's death at the time of her passing.


 


Someone used the identity of 
 to cast a ballot in last week's election, even though Blalock died in 2006. Blalock's death notice ran in the 
shortly after he passed away that year.


 


died in 2003, but someone cast a ballot under her identity in last week's election. Nicholson's death notice ran in the 
when she passed away.


 


 is shown as having cast a ballot last week, even though he died in 2015. The
ran a death notice in April of that year.

These victims of voter fraud deserve justice, and legal voters should be able to have confidence that their votes are not rendered meaningless due to illegally cast votes.
