"The labor market is expected to improve after the third quarter, with a rebound in hiring and a significant reduction in furloughs as the degree of social distancing diminishes—leading to an increase in business activity and an increase in the demand for workers. In particular, the unemployment rate is projected to decline to 9.5 percent by the end of 2021. Under that projection, the unemployment rate at the end of 2021 would be about 6 percentage points higher than the rate in CBO's economic projection produced in January 2020, and the labor force would have about 6 million fewer people."

"Economists at the bank now peg their base-case scenario for unemployment at the end of 2020 at 10.9%, up from a prediction of 6.6% when it reported first-quarter earnings.

Still, the pace of payroll gains slowed relative to recent months. Here were the main metrics from the Department of Labor's August jobs report released Friday morning, compared to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg: Change in non-farm payrolls: +1.371 million vs. +1.350 million expected, vs. +1.734 million in July; Unemployment rate: 8.4% vs. 9.8% expected, vs. 10.2% in July; Average hourly earnings, month over month: 0.4% vs. 0.0% expected, +0.1% in July; Average hourly earnings, year over year: 4.7% vs. 4.4% expected, 4.7% in July; Labor force participation rate: 61.7% vs. 61.8% expected, 61.4% in July."
