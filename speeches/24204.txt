I WAS PLEASED and gratified to receive today your report on the Summer Youth Opportunity Campaign.
All Americans have reason for satisfaction that, for the second straight year, more than 1 million young Americans have been at work who otherwise would have been without summer jobs. I think we have particular reason for satisfaction that all but 50,000 of the 1,048,554 jobs were provided by the private sector.
The jobs provided to these young people will give them a far better chance of continuing their education and becoming productive citizens--and far less chance of falling victim to delinquency and unemployment--than if they had been left in the streets during these summer months.
We are determined that the economic and social conditions which threaten the futures of our young people shall be overcome. But out efforts to defeat poverty, crowding, discrimination, and crime will not be completed tomorrow.
I am asking the Youth Opportunity Task Force, in cooperation with the Youth Opportunity Advisory Committee, to evaluate the program this summer and to look at the possibility of a continuing all-year youth opportunity program which can form the nucleus for an expanded summer job program next year.
In light of the estimated 900,000 young Americans who are expected to turn their backs on school during the coming year, I direct you to undertake again in 1966 a Stay-in-School Campaign so that our country will not suffer this terrible loss in its human resources.
At the same time I hope that all levels of government, as well as our private industry, agriculture, and labor, will be able to play an increasing and coordinated role in these programs so that the young people who most need skills and education will have their chance to receive them.
