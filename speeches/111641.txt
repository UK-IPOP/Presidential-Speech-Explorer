"Throughout his time in office, President Obama has repeatedly demonstrated how misplaced his priorities are by focusing on his own liberal agenda instead of job creation. But nowhere has this trend been more apparent than in President Obama's failure to even meet with his own jobs council for 191 days. With so many middle-class families struggling in the Obama economy, Americans deserve a president who will put job creation first." â€” Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson

 OBAMA: "Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen. The Internet didn't get invented on its own. Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet."
