Your Majesty:
I am most grateful for your thoughtful message. It is indeed appropriate that today, the fifteenth anniversary of the liberation of your great country, should be the occasion of the presentation of the monument from you and the people of The Netherlands to the people of the United States. Personally and on behalf of all our citizens I assure you of our deep appreciation. The monument will remain a symbol of the enduring friendship between our peoples.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
