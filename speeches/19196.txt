Your Majesty:
It is indeed a very great honor for me to be received here on the ground of this nation, which was the first nation that recognized the independence of the United States one and three quarters centuries ago..
So it is a definite feeling of kinship with this nation that I sense, as I come here to have these few hours with His Majesty and with his people. And my party and I, I assure you, do so with a feeling of honor and privilege.
