ARLINGTON, VA -- Today, McCain-Palin 2008 released its latest radio ad, entitled "Cuts." The ad features Senator John Warner (R-VA), the former Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, discussing the proposal by Barack Obama's Congressional allies to cut defense spending by 25%. If Barack Obama is elected, nothing will stop Congressional Democrats from cutting defense spending which will mean lost jobs in Virginia. The ad will air in Virginia.
