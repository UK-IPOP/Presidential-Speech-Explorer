[Released December 23, 1966. Dated December 19, 1966]
Dear Mr. Congressman:
Your letter of December 16 with its encouraging report on the improved quality of mail service to and from our service men and women in Vietnam comes at a time when they and their families and friends are most anxious to be in close communication.
No official report could be as heartening as your personal account of your offer to relay a message from a young soldier in Vietnam to his parents and your telephone call to them immediately upon your return-to find that his letter had already reached them.
It is encouraging to me, and I know it is to the Postmaster General and the Secretary of Defense, that the mail to and from Viet-Nam is moving rapidly. I am grateful for your personal observations that efforts to give the very best mail service to members of the Armed Forces in Vietnam are effective.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[The Honorable Thaddeus Dulski, House of Representatives, Washington, D.C.]
