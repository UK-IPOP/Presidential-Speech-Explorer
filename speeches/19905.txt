Dear Arthur:
Although I have long been aware of the considerations that require you to resume your University duties--and have fully appreciated them--I nevertheless regret that the time is now at hand when I must accept your resignation as Director, Office of Defense Mobilization, effective on the qualification of your successor.
As I have already endeavored to tell you, I have drawn constant reassurance from the fact that your many abilities were devoted to the vital task of preparing our nation against any eventuality. In this complex and exacting work, your vision and sound judgment have been of the highest value. The nation has indeed profited by your dedication to this service over the past four years.
Along with my appreciation of your services as Director, Office of Defense Mobilization, you have my thanks for your great contribution to the work of my Advisory Committee on Government Organization. I am glad that you can continue as a member of the Committee and will be available for further consultations from time to time.
With warm personal regard, and best wishes for your happiness and continued success,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
