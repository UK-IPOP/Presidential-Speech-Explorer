MRS. Nixon and I are deeply saddened by the death of the two students at Jackson State College. In the shadow of these past troubled days, this tragedy makes it urgent that every American personally undertake greater efforts toward understanding, restraint, and compassion. I am confident that the Nation joins ,us in extending sincere sympathy to the families of these two young men, James Earl Green and Phillip L.Gibbs.
