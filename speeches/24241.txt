I APPLAUD the action of the Senate housing subcommittee today in reporting out the demonstration cities bill.
This bill offers new and exciting opportunities for our citizens in cities across the country, large and small. The action of the Senate subcommittee is good news for the future of our cities and the millions of Americans who live in cities.
The bill is the first step towards new schools, new job opportunities, adequate health and community facilities, and rapid and economical transportation. It is the first step on the road in which city dwellers can live with hope and dignity, without fear, and with a pride not only in their home and in their neighborhood, but in their entire city.
I hope that the full committee and the Senate will act promptly on this measure.
