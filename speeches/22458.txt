Mr. Prime Minister and Mrs. Pearson, and distinguished and honored members of your party:
It is a great privilege to welcome you to this house and to this city.
We have the very unusual pleasure of enjoying the longest unguarded border that exists between two countries any place in the world. On that border we have no soldiers. We have no weapons. We have only long and enduring friends.
Mr. Prime Minister, we welcome you to this Capital. We look forward to fruitful and worthwhile discussions with you here in Washington. We hope you will enjoy your stay and we are delighted that you came.
