One gimmick might keep insurers in the game: The law's "risk corridor" provision allowed Washington to tax profitable exchange plans to prop up unprofitable ones.
But even in Year One, there weren't enough profits to cover the losses â€” so Team Obama transferred money from elsewhere.
This subsidy was entirely distinct from the law's support for lower-income folks: It was a bailout for the companies. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) put a stop to that last year, passing an amendment that prevents these back-door bailouts.
Without the extra taxpayer dollars, the administration can only deliver about 13 percent of the bailout cash needed this year. So it can't save the money-bleeding nonprofit "co-ops" the law set up either. More than half these nonprofits have failed already.
