I HAVE your inquiry as to whether it has been finally settled that the silver question will be dealt with at the forthcoming World Economic Conference and as to the constitution of the American Delegation to the Conference. At the request of the American government it has been agreed that the silver question will be a part of the conference. In making up the American Delegation I shall appoint someone representing the silver point of view as a member of the delegation. I prefer this representative to be a real representative of the silver mining interest and from the western portion of the United States.
