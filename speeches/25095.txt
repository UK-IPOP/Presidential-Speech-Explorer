BY MAKING available its vast resources and the diverse skills of its men and women, the Department of Defense has greatly assisted our national mobilization for the war on poverty. Without in any way reducing their combat effectiveness or interfering with their basic military mission, our Armed Forces have contributed to a speedier implementation of many antipoverty programs than would otherwise have been possible. And through their experience and efficiency, they have also achieved substantial economies in putting those programs into operation.
These accomplishments provide further proof that the American people, and their Government, are firmly determined to prosecute the war against poverty to a successful conclusion.
