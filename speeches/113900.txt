"The choice for voters is clear this November. Americans simply can't afford another four years of a 'buried' middle class. President Obama's failed economic policies have produced mounting debt, chronic unemployment, and falling incomes — and he's promised more of the same in a second term. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan will implement pro-growth policies that deliver 12 million new jobs, higher take-home pay, and a brighter future for all Americans." — Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 BIDEN: "This is deadly earnest. How they can justify, how they can justify, raising taxes on the middle class that has been buried in the last four years." (Vice President Joe Biden,

 "Median household incomes have fallen 8.2 percent since President Obama took office and continue to drop despite the official end of the  recession, a new study shows. Data compiled by Sentier Research found that since the economic recovery technically began in June 2009, median household income has dropped 5.7 percent. As of August, that median income was $50,678 -- also down 1.1 percent from the month prior.  And since Obama took office in January 2009, the median income has fallen 8.2 percent, from $55,198 to its present figure."

 "In a new paper, AEI's Matt Jensen looks at the real annual cost of servicing the debt for households at various levels of income — including a potentially higher tax burden. As the table below illustrates, a household making between $100,000 and $200,000 a year could find its tax liability higher by roughly $2,400 every year. Over ten years, that works out to $24,000. And when you add in the debt already accrued the past four years under President Obama (the second table), that's another $1,600 a year. So now we are now talking about $4,000 a year, $40,000 over ten years." (James Pethokoukis, "Study: Obama's Big Budget Deficits Could Mean A $4,000 A Year Middle-Class Tax Hike,"

 "Researchers determined the plan would actually subject 2.1 million business owners to higher rates; specifically, those who pay pass-through taxes, like most partnerships, LLCs and S-Corporations. The result, less capital in the hands of business owners and diminished labor supply, would cost the United States an estimated $200 billion in economic output and 710,000 jobs." (J.D.
