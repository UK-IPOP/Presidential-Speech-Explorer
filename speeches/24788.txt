[Released October 9, 1965. Dated October 8, 1965] To Mary Martin and the Cast of "Hello Dolly":
Your journey has been long, but I know that it will be rewarding. I want to thank each of you personally for coming to Vietnam to bring music, magic, and laughter to our sons and husbands who are so far from home.
The footlights may be dimmed after the show but they will not be dimmed in the hearts of the servicemen who see you perform. As your song goes, "For Dolly will never go away again."
LYNDON B. JOHNSON

You are a front-line patriot in the work you are doing. You're making your President and all of Wetherford, Texas, deeply proud of you. Lady Bird and I send you our warm affections.
