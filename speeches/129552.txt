. Thank you very much, everybody. We have some wonderful meetings going on over the last 2 days. We are friends. We've been friends now for a long time, indirectly, haven't we?

Yes, we are.

And our relationship is extremely good. We have some very serious discussions right now going on. And one of the things that we will discuss is the purchase of lots of beautiful military equipment, because nobody makes it like the United States. And for us, that means jobs. And it also means, frankly, great security back here, which we want.

So it's an honor to be with you, and thank you very much.

Thank you very much. Thank you.

 Okay, thank you, everybody.
