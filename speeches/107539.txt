AUSTIN - The Perry campaign today released a 60-second television advertisement entitled "President of Honor," which will air on South Carolina broadcast and cable.
"The decorated military veterans in this TV ad speak strongly for Gov. Perry's character, faith and leadership," said Perry campaign spokesman Ray Sullivan. "These vets know Rick Perry's pro-American, pro-job and pro-veteran record. Additionally, Gov. Perry is the one true Washington outsider left in this race and has an unparalleled record of job creation, having created more than one million net new jobs while in office."
