It's go time.
We know these primaries are won and lost on voter turnoutâ€”so we need to do our part to make sure every last Hillary Clinton supporter in South Carolina gets to the polls today.
You don't even need a phone. Just 
 to get started.
It'll go a little something like this: We'll dial up a Hillary supporter in South Carolina. You'll remind them the primary is today and tell them their polling location. (Don't worry, we'll help you with what to say.) They'll thank you, and probably tell you how psyched they are to vote today!
It's really that easy.
With your help, we can put South Carolina in the win column and keep building our momentum across the country.
So let's get this done for Hillary!
