Dear Mr. Hopkins:
I have your letter of September twenty-ninth and approve the action taken by the committee appointed by me at the meeting of September fifth.
Now that your recommendations have been made, we can all proceed to take speedy action to set up a national memorial worthy of the historic achievements in war and peace of the late illustrious President.

Very sincerely,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
