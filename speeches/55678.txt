The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 1688, if it is amended to address the following two issues:


— Puerto Rico, Micronesia, and the Marshall Islands should be removed from the bill's definition of "insular area."

— The bill should include an explicit 50 percent local match requirement with respect to the increase in federal hazard mitigation assistance. 
The Administration's other concerns are discussed in the attachment.
