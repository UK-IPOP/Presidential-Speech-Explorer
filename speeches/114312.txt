 "Today's White House response to the violent attacks in Libya and Egypt was totally unacceptable, as was, the disgraceful statement issued by the Embassy in Cairo. ... The State Department should issue an immediate apology to the American people and fire those officials responsible for the initial statement. The White House and State Department responses go beyond the realm of simple diplomacy." (Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, Statement, 9/12/12)
 "I think what Mitt Romney was doing was recognizing that this is an administration whose foreign policy certainly is collapsing in many parts around the world, whether it's in Europe where he pulled out our missile defense systems, only to get the Russians to spend more money on military instead of less."

 BOLTON: "I agree with your characterization of the Obama statement. I thought it conveyed weakness again. And I think when you look at the big picture, I am very worried that the failure to make it clear publicly as well as privately that there are consequences when our ambassadors are killed, when our people are put in jeopardy, and other Americans, not just the official Americans, private citizens in the region are in jeopardy as well." (Fox Business Network's "Markets Now," 9/12/12)

Well, leading from behind does have consequences...including instability, lost opportunities.'" (

 "Today is significant because it is a dramatic demonstration of a failed approach to the world. Weakness invites attacks, disloyalty to allies encourages foes. And Obama has no right to insist he is beyond criticism." (
