A little inspiration and a knack for beading can go a long way.

  " In 1992 I was struggling with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. [Minnesota] had a program for people struggling with mental and physical disabilities. I could finish grad school or open a small business. "

  " Why don't you bead something for Hillary Clinton?"

  " As I waited in line for my turn, I saw that she was wearing a scarf around her neck. And when I turned the corner, to my great joy, she was wearing one of my necklaces! When I got close to her I said, in tears, ?Thank you for wearing my necklace!'"

  " It starts with a bead, that becomes a bracelet, that turns into a necklace, then into 990,000 necklaces. My one bead started with help of Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is ... the best suited candidate to be the next president of the United States."
