Hello! I will be your pooler for this weekend's trip to Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.

The president and Dr. Biden walked off Marine One 11:57 a.m. Willow was taken off the helo at 11:58 a.m.
The motorcade was rolling to the beach house at 11:59 a.m.
The pool was on a gravel path and sand dune, so not in the proximity to shout questions.

Good afternoon all,
Hello from the White House, which has asked us to send a belated pool report; there was apparently a mixup on the original outlet that was due to pool today. On behalf of the wires, we hope we'll suffice as a fallback...!
President Biden spoke this morning at the virtual Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate. He began speaking at 8:34 am, following remarks from John Kerry, and the press portion concluded at 8:42 am. A link to the video can be found here: 
Biden left the White House residence at 10:59 am, accompanied by the First Lady. Staff gathered along a ropeline to the east, and she greeted them while Biden came over to the press ropeline briefly. Audio was spotty as he moved down the line, so please check against the feed or transcript once available. But highlights include:
Marine One took off for Rehoboth at 11:07 am. Aides accompanying the President and First Lady include Steve Ricchetti, Assistant to the President & Counselor to the President, and Anthony Bernal, Assistant to the President & Advisor to the First Lady, per the White House. A cat carrier was also seen being loaded on the helicopter.
Marine One landed in Rehoboth at 11:54 am. Handing it off again to the out-of-town pool.
Best,
Josh
