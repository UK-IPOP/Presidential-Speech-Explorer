Washington D,C,
March 30th 1870.
HON. J. SHERMAN: U.S.S.
DEAR SIR:
Your note of this date just rec'd. Presuming that no vote will be reached to-day on the Dominican treaty, I will take no steps in the matter before to-morrow, unless further advised of the necessity of so doing. I regret the failure of a favorable vote on your motion.
Truly yours
