Dear Mr. Justice:
Thank you very much for giving me timely notice that, because of your health, you will retire on October fifteenth. May I be permitted to express my appreciation of the many years you have given to public service on the Federal Bench, culminating in your service on the Supreme Court?
I trust you will find your life in retirement to be filled both with contentment and good health.
With personal regard,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
