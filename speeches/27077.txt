THE EFFECT of today's House action, in denying a rule to the rat extermination act, is a cruel blow to the poor children of America.
Every year thousands of those children-many of them babies--are bitten by rats in their homes and tenements. Some are killed. Many are disfigured for life.
The amount of money needed to fight this national shame is small. But the stakes--the health of our children and of every city dweller--are very great.
We are spending Federal funds to protect our livestock from rodents and predatory animals. The least we can do is give our children the same protection that we give our livestock.
I hope that those in the House who have voted against this program will reexamine their position. I hope they will vote to defend the children who are now menaced by rats.
