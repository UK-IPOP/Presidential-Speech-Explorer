With reference to the messages which you kindly sent me on October second and October thirteenth, it gives me great pleasure to renew my sincere good wishes for the future of Guinea which were conveyed to you through our Consul General in Dakar and to extend to your Government the formal recognition of the Government of the United States.

Sincerely,
