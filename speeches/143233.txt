?Good morning,

It's a cold and sunny day at the White House, where the snow has melted but some ice remains.

Your pooler has been tested for COVID-19.

President Trump has nothing on his public schedule today that's open to press. At 2:15 PM, President Trump and the First Lady will sign legislation authorizing a women's suffrage monument in D.C. but the event is closed press.

President Trump has been tweeting this morning.

I'll keep you posted on any updates. 


?We have a lunch lid until 1:30 PM. 


The pool was not pulled into President Trump's signing ceremony in the Oval Office. But at 2:30 PM your pooler observed the Marine posted outside the West Wing go back inside.

No other updates. 


Your pooler just received this from Judd Deere:

Today, President Donald J. Trump spoke with King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia. The two leaders discussed regional security and key bilateral issues. President Trump thanked King Salman for his leadership and expressed his optimism towards resolving the Gulf Rift. 


For anyone keeping close tabs on this stuff, your pooler saw a Marine outside the West Wing again at 3:30 PM, indicating the President is likely in the Oval Office again. 


?A travel photo lid was called at 7:52 PM.

As a final note, a Marine was outside the West Wing until roughly 5:26 PM for those of you monitoring this.

Stay healthy and happy holidays to all.
