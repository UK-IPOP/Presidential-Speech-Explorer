Every facility of the Federal Government early today was made available by order of President Roosevelt, to relieve distress through cooperation with California State officials dealing with the earthquake and fire catastrophe in the Los Angeles-Long Beach area.
The President received advices from the War and Navy Departments stating that both Army and Navy Officers already were cooperating and rendering assistance wherever possible.
At the same time the President received a report from Vice-Chairman James L. Fieser of the American Red Cross, which reads in part as follows:
"I wish to advise that Mr. A. L. Schafer, Manager of the Long Beach Branch Office in San Francisco, and former Manager Director of Disaster Relief, accompanied by Mr. J. W. Richardson, experienced disaster executive, flew from San Francisco to Los Angeles on the midnight mail plane last night and are directing the activity of the numerous Red Cross Chapters and Branches from that point.
"My conversations with our Branch Office in San Francisco indicate utmost and most satisfactory arrangements on the part of the Red Cross forces in the affected area.
"Much of the problem to date is concentrated in Los Angeles County itself. Los Angeles and adjacent Red Cross Chapters are excellently organized.
"Additional experienced Red Cross personnel will be made available as rapidly as needed.
"Judge Payne has wired Governor Rolph expression of sympathy and has offered the services of the National Red Cross. Our San Francisco Branch Office is in touch directly with the Governor. Mr. Schafer will arrange cooperative relationship with Army and Navy forces in the Pacific area."
The President further instructed the Treasury Department to have the Public Health Service in readiness to render every possible assistance.
