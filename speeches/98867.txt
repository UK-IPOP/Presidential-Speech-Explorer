ARLINGTON, VA -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today released its latest Spanish radio ad, entitled "Are You Ready For Obama?" The ad highlights Barack Obama's record of voting to raise taxes on middle class families and his proposals for painful tax increases that will only further hurt those already struggling with higher gas prices, higher food prices and the threat of home foreclosure. The last thing we need to do is raise taxes that force families to make even tougher choices with less money in their pockets. The ad will air in key states.
