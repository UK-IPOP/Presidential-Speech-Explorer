Mr. President, Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen:
It is a very great honor for me, Mr. President, personally to be welcomed again to Rome, and you very appropriately have pointed out that to begin our trip to Europe in Rome is certainly a proper step to take, because as we come to Rome on this occasion we have an opportunity to renew discussions with you and members of your Government and to continue the cooperation and the friendship that has characterized the relations between our two countries for so many years.
I shall have the opportunity, too, to renew discussions with Pope Paul on international matters of common interest, and I shall have the opportunity to visit the American 6th Fleet and our NATO commanders as well, yours and ours, and to discuss there one of the primary indispensable principles of American foreign policy. And that principle is to maintain the necessary strength in the Mediterranean to preserve the peace against those who might threaten the peace.
The Mediterranean is the cradle of many great civilizations of the past, and we are determined that it shall not be the starting place of great wars in the future.
Italy which has the longest coastline of any nation in the Mediterranean, has, understandably, a tremendous stake in peace in the Mediterranean.
The great Italian patriot, Garibaldi, in writing to Abraham Lincoln in 1863, identified himself among the free children of Columbus. Mr. President, we in America are proud to share that common heritage, and as we share that common heritage of the past, we are proud to work with you in seeing that that heritage of freedom for our children will be preserved in the future.

Thank you.
