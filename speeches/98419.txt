 
 ABC's CYNTHIA MCFADDEN: "Joining me now is ABC's chief Washington correspondent George Stephanopoulos for the Nightline
 
 "Absolutely, she did not sound like she was from one of the coasts. She sounded like she was a really normal, down-to-earth person, and at the same time, clearly she is an extraordinary person, because she was absolutely dazzling." (MSNBC's "Morning Joe," 9/4/08) 
 "On Wednesday night, she took the opportunity to answer back, and she put her critics -- Democrats, the media and the Washington political establishment -- on notice that she is ready for a fight." (Dan Balz, "Striking Back At Critics, One By One," 
, 9/4/08) 
 "She's a natural, gifted with the ability to connect with people in a way that few politicians can and to perform under extreme pressure. She has star quality." (Fred Barnes, "The Natural," 
, 9/4/08) 
 "Sarah Palin delivered what may have been the most important speech ever by a vice presidential candidate and made it look like she'd been performing on the national political stage for years." (Fred Barnes, "The Natural," 
, 9/4/08) 
 "Sarah Palin delivered. But the former TV sportscaster spoke in calm, TV-friendly tones reminiscent of Ronald Reagan. Like the former GOP president, Palin warmed the crowd with quips and jokes." (Tom Raum and Liz Sidoti, "Palin Delivers Star-Turning Performance For GOP," 
, 9/4/08) 
 "I think this was a very strong presentation. I think it was well-received. I think what Sarah Palin achieved tonight, what Governor Palin achieved, is something that a lot of Republicans who are here and who are watching didn`t think was necessarily possible. And that is that there could be a very energized and enthusiastic base of the Republican Party." (MSNBC's "MSNBC Special," 9/3/08) 
 "Simply brilliant ... It was incredibly sophisticated and effective. You know, it was derisive of Barack Obama in a sort of funny way but a very poignant way, about his lack of experience and about, you know, her experience as a mayor." (Fox News' "American Election Headquarters," 9/3/08) 
 "A star was born last night--but I won't belabor that fact, especially since it was the title of my New York Times column Monday." (Bill Kristol, "The Speech," 
, 9/4/08) 
 "I don't think it's overstating it to say being right here on the floor that a star was born tonight -- a new star in the political galaxy." (FOX News' "On The Record," 9/4/08) 
 (MSNBC's "Morning Joe," 9/4/08) 
 "Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin's acceptance speech at the convention last night was an impressive debut on the national stage -- well-delivered, with an appealing combination of charm and bite befitting her description of a hockey mom as a pit bull in lipstick. The Alaska governor proved herself more than capable of making a strong case for nominee John McCain and landing some pretty good zingers, aimed at both the Democratic nominee and the 'Washington elite.'" (Editorial, "Ms. Palin's Introduction," 
, 9/4/08) 
 "'She was confident, articulate and strong. And she seemed folksy and real. So she's passed the style test. The next test will be on substance,' said Democratic analyst Steve McMahon." (David Brown, Salena Zito and Mike Wereschagin, "'Small-Town' VP Nominee Palin Stands Tall," 
, 9/4/08) 
 
 "Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin electrified the Republican convention Wednesday night, pitching herself as a champion of government reform, mocking Democratic candidate Barack Obama as an elitist and belittling media criticism of her experience." (Michael D. Shear, "Palin Comes Out Fighting," 
, 9/4/08) 
 "The Republican presidential nomination his at last, John McCain makes his case for the presidency to the GOP convention and the nation after his surprise choice for vice president, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, energized delegates with a rousing speech." (Glen Johnson, "Palin Revs Up Republicans For McCain," 
, 9/4/08) 
 "
 (ABC's "Republican National Convention Coverage," 9/3/08) 
 "Right here at the Republican National Convention in St. Paul and it was thunderous in this room last night." (ABC's "Good Morning America," 9/4/08) 
 (CBS' "The Early Show," 9/4/08) 
 "What a night it's been. History has been made. The Republicans going forward for the first time in their history with a woman who will be on the ticket. And we heard from the governor of Alaska. She delivered a very, very passionate and rousing speech." (CNN's "Larry King Live," 9/4/08) 
 "What I have been hearing from Democrats around the country as they've been watching is they say, 'She is terrific.'" (FOX News' "On The Record," 9/4/08) 
 "But here's your problem: she looked good, she sounded good, she was good and she connects with women. I'm telling you right now, I watched it from my perspective as a working mother and I can tell you there are probably many out there facing many different types of challenges in their lives, economic, and that woman spoke to women across America in a way any other candidate, male -- sorry -- could not have. She brings a new dimension to this race, you have to admit it." (MSNBC's "Morning Joe," 9/4/08) 
 "She brought them to their feet. In the biggest speech of her lifetime, and her first ever to a national audience, Alaska Governor Sarah Palin energized the crowd and she showed that she could throw some pretty good punches of her own." (NBC's "Today," 9/4/08) 
 "In her first national address, vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin wowed the Republican convention using wit, sarcasm, charm and ridicule in a full scale assault on a now familiar cast of GOP targets -- an elitist adversary, a biased media and high taxes." (Jeanne Cummings and Beth Frerking, "Palin Wows GOP, Puts Dems On Notice," 
, 9/4/08) 
 "Unknown even to many Republicans a week ago, Palin wrapped a personal profile and philosophical pitch into a 40-minute talk that brought thundering ovations from delegates at the Republican National Convention." (David Brown, Salena Zito and Mike Wereschagin, "'Small-town' VP Nominee Palin Stands Tall," 
, 9/4/08) 
 "When the nearly 40-minute address came to a close, however, all doubts were doused and Democrats were on notice that Palin will not flinch from the fight." (Jeanne Cummings and Beth Frerking, "Palin Wows GOP, Puts Dems On Notice," 
, 9/4/08) 
 (CBS' "The Early Show," 9/4/08) 
 "The attack on Obama was very deft. Palin went right for Obama's fundamental weakness--that he's never done anything impressive. (And by giving such a good speech, she partly undermined his claim to be the only one who could speak impressively.)." (Bill Kristol, "The Speech," 
, 9/4/08)
