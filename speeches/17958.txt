WITH THIS MEMORANDUM, I am transmitting a copy of the Report to the President and the Congress by the Commission on Foreign Economic Policy. The Commission, as you know, was set up, at my request, by the Congress to study and report on the over-all foreign economic policy of this country.
I am anxious that Executive Departments and Agencies with responsibilities in the area of foreign economic policy proceed immediately with an intensive review of this report as a first step in the formulation of a unified Administration program to be submitted to the Congress for its attention during the current session.
I am confident that, on the basis of the Report, it will be possible to develop a program that will advance the best interests both of the United States and of the free world.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
