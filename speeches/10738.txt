THE PRESIDENT said:
"I have directed the law enforcement agencies and the several secret services of the Federal Government to make the kidnaping and murder of the Lindbergh baby a live and never to be forgotten case, never to be relaxed until those criminals are implacably brought to justice. The Federal Government does not have police authority in such crimes, but its agencies will be unceasingly alert to assist the New Jersey police in every possible way until this end has been accomplished."
