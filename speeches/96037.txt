 This young democracy has made tremendous progress, but it still needs the full support of the international community for the Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS) to ensure continued political and financial assistance for Afghanistan. The First Lady's speech in support of a stable, democratic, and productive Afghanistan further reinforces President Bush's commitment to aid the men, women, and children of Afghanistan as they fight tyranny and radical extremism.
 In 2001, an estimated 8 percent of Afghans had access to basic healthcare. Today, the figure is over 80 percent. Under the Taliban, there were only 30 miles of paved roads. Today, thousands of miles of roads connect Afghans and enable expanded trade and commerce. Under the Taliban, less than a million children were in school. Today, approximately six million Afghan children receive an education â€“ and a third of those are girls.
