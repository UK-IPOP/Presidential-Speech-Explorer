[Released November 13, 1956. Dated November 12, 1956]
Dear Arthur:
While I have known for some weeks that your departure from public service was imminent, I confess to being unprepared for the actual receipt of your letter of resignation. In view of the personal factors involved, however, I have no alternative but to accept it as you requested. This I do with great reluctance.
You have made a unique contribution to the labors of this Administration in the area of economic growth and stability where our efforts have been rewarded with gratifying success. Your intellectual proficiency and skill, together with your strength of character and resolute spirit, have in a special way enlisted economics in the nation's service. And you have done so in a manner which demonstrates that economics and equity can be allies and not antagonists. If the day ever comes when sound economic policies fail to serve the ends of social justice, our form of society will be in grave jeopardy.
I have been pleased with the manner in which the Council of Economic Advisers, under your leadership, has been re-established as a vital center of economic intelligence, as contemplated by the Employment Act of 1946. The wide respect in which the Council is held today, not only in the Executive Branch but throughout the government and the country as well, is ample evidence of your work in this regard.
My best wishes accompany you as you return to private life. My own personal sense of loss is eased by the knowledge that you will be available to help us from time to time in the days ahead.
With warm personal regard,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
