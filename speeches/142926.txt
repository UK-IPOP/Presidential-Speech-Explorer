Pool Reports by 
, 
Good morning, I'm your pooler today.
Pool is currently getting their Covid tests. The president has no public events scheduled as of yet.
Since some people have reached out to ask about rumors Trump will speak this afternoon, I just wanted to confirm that I don't have any info on this. I asked but was told nothing is currently on the schedule.
Will of course immediately update if that changes.
Lunch lid called at 12:41pm until 2pm.
After a day of radio silence from the WH a lid is called at about 7:03.
