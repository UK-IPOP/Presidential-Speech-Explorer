Pool Reports by 
, 
Good Sunday morning from Lewes, Delaware. Our call time was just pushed back from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.
Nothing else to report, and still nothing on POTUS' schedule for the day, although you probably caught the FLOTUS statement earlier that she is now Covid-negative and headed to Delaware from South Carolina some time this afternoon.
Will be in touch when we have more from here.
Call time pushed back another hour to 1 p.m.
And our call time here in Lewes/Rehoboth has been pushed back a third time to 3 p.m..
You also may have seen 10 Downing Street's readout of a call this morning between the PM, POTUS, Macron and Scholz. I'll be sure and pass along any WH confirmation or readout that comes our way.
Our new call time is now 6 p.m.
Still no indication that there will be any sort of pool movement later, but we continue to hold.
Also, the WH sent this out via email earlier but here is a link to the readout on the POTUS call earlier with the Macron, Scholz and Johnson:
Travel/photo lid called at 5:27 p.m. on this quiet but very pleasant Sunday in Rehoboth.
Good night, all.
