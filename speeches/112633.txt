"Nearly four years ago, President Obama promised Virginians that he would jumpstart our nation's economy. But after years of failed economic policies that have left nearly twenty-three million Americans struggling for work, it's clear President Obama doesn't have what it takes to get our economy moving again." â€“Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 "The campaign is also planning to dispatch staff and local surrogates to Obama's rally at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, where the president is expected to speak at 4:35 p.m. ET." (Holly Bailey, "Obama's Re-Election Rallies On Saturday To Be Blitzed By Romney Campaign,"

 OBAMA: "Wages are lower than they've been in a decade, at a time when the cost of health care and college have never been higher. It's getting harder and harder to make the mortgage, or fill up your gas tank, or even keep the electricity on at the end of the month. At this rate, the question isn't just 'are you better off than you were four years ago?', it's 'are you better off than you were four weeks ago?'" (Senator Barack Obama, 
, Richmond, VA, 10/22/08)
 OBAMA: "I'll also put two million more Americans to work rebuilding our crumbling roads, schools, and bridges - because it is time to build an American infrastructure for the 21st century." (Senator Barack Obama, 
, Richmond, VA, 10/22/08)
 OBAMA: "If I am President, I will invest $15 billion a year in renewable sources of energy to create five million new, green jobs over the next decade - jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced; jobs building solar panels and wind turbines and fuel-efficient cars; jobs that will help us end our dependence on oil from Middle East dictators." (Senator Barack Obama, 
, Richmond, VA, 10/22/08)
