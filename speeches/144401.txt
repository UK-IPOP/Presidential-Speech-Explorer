Today, speaking from the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, President Biden spoke about our duty to protect the sacred, constitutional right to vote -- the foundation of democracy.
As many Americans, especially people of color, face significant and increasing obstacles to the right to vote – based on the Big Lie -- the President emphasized the urgency with which lawmakers need to act to meet the greatest threat to voting rights and the integrity of our elections since the Civil War.
He renewed his calls for vital legislation to overcame the rash of anti-voter laws, including the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the For the People Act – which Democrats have unanimously voted to advance while Republicans obstruct its path.
The President's remarks were met with praise from elected officials, activists, voting advocates, and community leaders across the country, who join in his commitment to protect and defend free and fair elections that reflect the will of the American people.
 "I am proud to join President Biden in Philadelphia, the birthplace of our nation, to stand up for the freedom to vote and the sacred right to have your voice heard in our elections. Not only will I stand against any efforts to roll back our freedoms, I will continue to push for changes to take down the barriers to voting that still exist. This is a critical moment for our democracy.? Some bad actors in the state legislature and across the country are spewing lies and debunked conspiracy theories to make people question the results of the November election. These are the same lies they used to try to throw out every vote cast in the November 2020 election and ultimately caused the January 6 insurrection which shocked our nation with images of horrendous violence and destruction as a mob invaded the U.S. Capitol. Now these bad actors are pushing Arizona- style sham election reviews that are a chaotic and embarrassing mess that divide people and waste taxpayer dollars. They're the same fringe politicians who want to pass laws to take away the freedom to vote for their own political gain. It is shameful and un-American. Pennsylvanians believe in freedom and fairness, and I share President Biden's commitment to protecting our elections and the sacred right to vote. That is why I recently vetoed a bill that was disguised as election reform but was really about creating barriers to voting. All of us must stand united to defend the core values of our country and protect our democracy. Future generations are depending on us to rise to the moment." [7/13/21]

 "President Biden accurately characterized the anti-democracy actions by state legislators and others following January 6: 'There's an unfolding assault taking place in America today, an attempt to suppress and subvert the right to vote in fair and free elections...So make no mistake: Bullies and merchants of fear, peddlers of lies, are threatening the very foundation of our country.' President Biden's speech today ultimately was a needed call to action for this multiracial coalition of democracy defenders in this country to 'rise to the urgency of this moment' as John Lewis, Amelia Boyton, and other leaders did during the civil rights movement. We must all gather the power we have to protect and exercise our right to vote and ensure it is available to and used by our families, neighbors, and communities to build a democracy that truly works for everyone."
