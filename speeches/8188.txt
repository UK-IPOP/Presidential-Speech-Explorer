My dear Mr. Chief Justice:
I was deeply pained at receiving your letter of resignation today. For some time I have been aware of the shock you received to your health and have been fearful lest this event should occur.
In accepting your resignation I would like to add my personal appreciation of the long and distinguished service of a great American to his country.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[The Honorable William Howard Taft, Chief Justice of the United States, Washington, D.C. ]
