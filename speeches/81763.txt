Domestic violence is a serious problem affecting women, men and children of all backgrounds. According to the National Crime Victimization Survey, there were nearly 700,000 documented incidents of domestic violence affecting individuals and families in 2001. President Bush is committed to preventing domestic violence, addressing the effects of domestic violence on all Americans, and has secured historic levels of funding for the Violence Against Women programs at the Department of Justice. In the FY 2002 budget, the President requested and secured approximately a $100 million increase in funding for these programs, and has continued to provide similar levels of funding in the FY 2003 and FY 2004 budgets. Federal prosecutions relating to violence against women increased by 35% in FY 2002. The Bush Administration is committed to zero tolerance towards domestic violence.
