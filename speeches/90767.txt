The legislation, among other things, unambiguously prohibits any United States personnel, including members of our intelligence services, from torturing and mistreating detainees.

The legislation also closes black sites and extra-judicial prisons, prohibits extraordinary renditions, prohibits the torture and mistreatment of detainees in U.S. custody, modifies the definition of "unlawful enemy combatant," and extends habeas corpus to detainees.
