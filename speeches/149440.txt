Hello,

Here is the schedule for the day:
At 9:09 en route to Delaware Air National Guard Base.

POTUS' motorcade arrived at the base at 9:17. The ride was uneventful.
POTUS emerged from the motorcade at 9:19 ascended the stairs at, waved and entered AF1.

Little correction for the last pool note—osprey has wheels up at 10:15. Not 10:16. Your pooler did not see M1 take off but she did see it land at the Wall Street Landing Zone about 10:28. Your pooler thought she spotted his feet emerge from M1 at 10:31 and enter the motorcade
(Osprey landed at 10:23) (He did not stop to speak with press, located on the opposite side of M1)
The motorcade began rolling at 10:34.

Dozens of onlookers behind a NYPD post, holding iPhones, presumable recording the motorcade winded through the Upper East Side across E 96th street and down 5th avenue. About 3-4 people clapped, one women shouted "whoo" and stuck her fist in the air.

As a reminder, here's the list of people traveling on AF1 that the travel pool received from the White House:
From the WH: 
Annie Tomasini, Assistant to the President & Director of Oval Office Operations

The motorcade arrived at the White House at 2:46p after an uneventful drive from JBA. As the motorcade drove by the National Mall and approached the White House, scattered onlookers filmed it with their phones. The pool was unable to see POTUS go inside.
Pool gathered in the briefing room at 4:30p and will shortly head into the Roosevelt Room for the president's remarks on gas prices.
[

POTUS remarks on oil companies and gas prices began at 4:34p. He is flanked by Janet Yellen and Jennifer Granholm.
"One by one major oil companies have reported record profits… I mean profits so high it's hard to believe."
"It's outrageous"
"Their excess profits are going back to their shareholders."
"Oil companies record profits today are not bc they're doing something innovative." He calls their profits a "windfall of war."
Biden says oil companies will pay a higher tax on excess profits if there is no change.
In response to shouted questions, POTUS says his call with Lula went very well and they're putting a team together.
Please check quotes against transcript!
Pool is gathering at the Palm Room doors at 4:46p.
The pool is set up on the South Lawn, where a live band is playing the Game of Thrones theme. In a stroke of Halloween luck, it has stopped raining for now.
There are pumpkins and enormous pots of orange mums set up in front of glowing cut outs of buildings, some of which have ravens or black cats in the windows. Spooky!
There is a line of costumed children and their parents waiting to trick or treat. Your pooler can see someone dressed as a rocket, a pumpkin, and a tiny fireman.
A photo of the facade is attached.
POTUS and FLOTUS stepped out of the White House at 5:15p. POTUS wore a navy blue raincoat and a baseball cap, while FLOTUS dressed as a butterfly, with teal wings and a lavender wig.
Members of the administration, including education secretary Miguel Cardona and deputy cabinet Secretary Dan Koh, are trick or treating with their children. POTUS and FLOTUS are handing out boxes containing Hershey's kisses.
The music, by the presidents own marine band, is too loud for your pooler to make out what the President and First Lady are saying to the trick or treaters, but your pooler is trying!
According to background sent earlier by the White House, trick or treaters here also include children of police officers, firefighters, nurses and others.
There is no pool report #9. Your pooler is sorry for the ghostly disappearance.
POTUS and FLOTUS are still handing out candy, which includes fun-size candy bars in addition to the boxes of Kisses. When POTUS saw a child dressed as a monk, he made the sign of the cross.
POTUS and FLOTUS have also given candy to Piglet, Glinda the Good Witch, a family dressed up as "Duck duck goose," a tiny giraffe, a lot of Spidermen, an astronaut, a flamingo, Uncle Sam and a zombie founding father, who got a pat on the shoulder from the President.
The White House passes along this background about today's Halloween event.
On Halloween evening, the President and First Lady are hosting local children of firefighters, nurses, police officers, and members of the National Guard at the White House for trick-or-treating. Children will walk through the "President and First Lady's Neighborhood" up to the South Portico of the White House where they will receive treats from the President and First Lady, and other White House "neighbors", including representatives from the Department of Education, Department of Transportation, NASA, United States Secret Service, Peace Corps, White House Fire Brigade, White House staff, and White House Military Office. Disney characters Doc McStuffins and Vampirina, PBS KIDS characters Daniel Tiger, Donkey Hodie, Alma, and Xavier Riddle, and Star Wars characters Darth Vader and stormtroopers, will also stroll through the "President and First Lady's Neighborhood" for the Halloween festivities. The White House is decorated for Halloween with autumnal foliage and fall colors, and a silhouetted neighborhood of homes and community buildings will illuminate the South Portico. Halloween treats are provided by the National Confectioners Association.
POTUS and FLOTUS are still handing out candy in front of the South Portico, over an hour after they began. The President has shaken hands with a kid dressed like the Scream villain, hugged a boy dressed as a squirrel and handed candy to a pair of Buzz Lightyears.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken, whose father's memorial service POTUS attended this morning in NYC, came by with this family. His two young children were dressed in tiny suits.
At 6:25, with darkness falling, POTUS and FLOTUS brought their candy baskets toward the assembled photographers and gave candy to them. They posed for a photo in front of the portico and then went inside. At 6:30p, POTUS appeared on the balcony. He waved at the crowd — which still included a long line of trick or treaters — and went back inside at 6:31p.
The White House called a lid at 6:53p. Happy Halloween!
