"After two days of campaigning on college campuses, it's clear that enthusiasm for President Obama is down sharply among young Americans. With one of every two recent college graduates unemployed or underemployed, President Obama won't be able to skate by on empty rhetoric and campaign promises - he'll have to run on his failed record of high unemployment, skyrocketing gas prices, and mountains of new debt."  -Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 "But as the president embarks on a three-state tour of college campuses to press Congress to act to preserve low interest rates on student loans, there were indications that enthusiasm was sharply down among members of the so-called millennial generation, with the sagging economy the main factor."

 "Republican registrations among 18 to 24 in North Carolina, Colorado and Iowa have all increased since 2008, according to data provided by the RNC via the three state secretaries of state offices.

 "Once Obama took the stage, the capacity crowd of 8,000 cheered loudly, but it didn't compare to his appearance on campus four year ago before a much larger crowd. And interviews with more than a dozen other college students like Walsh and Fleishman indicate that support for Obama, though strong, is infused with less enthusiasm."

 "The UNC-Chapel Hill freshmen were too young to vote in 2008, but they were big Obama supporters, magnetized they say by his star quality. 'Since 2008, I think you can really say it's ...'

 "'What I hear from students is not about student loans but anxiety about jobs,' said Kenneth Bickers, a political science professor at CU. 'There are just a lot fewer stickers on clothing, computers and backpacks. There doesn't seem to be the same sort of visual excitement as you walk across campus.'"

 "Teenaged workers, whether it was students seeking summer jobs or school dropouts and graduates looking for full-time work, were particularly hard-hit by joblessness. Only one in four U.S. teenagers held a job in 2011, the smallest percentage in decades and half what it was in 1999-2000." (Andrew Stern, "Job Market Hurt Teens Most: Study,"
