The Administration opposes S.J. Res. 241, which would prevent the U.S./Japan agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation from being brought into effect. The Administration urges that Congress give favorable consideration to the proposed agreement for cooperation. Rejection of the agreement would undercut overall relations with Japan and weaken our influence over Japan's future nuclear program. The new agreement substantially advances our non-proliferation objective of ensuring that the use of nuclear material in peaceful energy programs will not increase the risk that nuclear weapons will spread to additional countries.

If S.J. Res. 241 were presented to the President, the President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto the resolution.
