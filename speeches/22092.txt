JOBLESSNESS among young men and women today is the bitter root of tomorrow's poverty. While unemployment among young workers has always been higher than among the the more mature, it has been worsening in recent years. Almost 1 million young men and women are today without work. The unemployment rate for teenagers is 18 percent.
I am especially concerned about the plight of those young people who are growing into adulthood in areas of poverty and depression. There unemployment is not just a temporary hiatus between school and work. It is too often the beginning of an enduring disqualification from opportunity. It is a turning onto a road that leads nowhere. Lack of skill, language difficulty, ignorance of work discipline, and poor academic backgrounds enforce discrimination's hand. The result is a generation without a future.
The program announced today is the latest and one of the most promising in a variety of efforts we are making to bring opportunity to neighborhoods where it has long been absent. The road before us is long, but it lessens with each step. The Mobilization for Youth program has my deep interest and support.
