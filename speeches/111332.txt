"With unemployment at a five-month high and stagnant economic growth, President Obama and his campaign are willing to say and do anything to hide the President's disappointing record. But they're not entitled to repeatedly mislead voters. Americans deserve better — they deserve a president who's willing to run an honest campaign and be honest about his own record." — Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman
 TIME'S MARK HALPERIN: "Robert we all feel bad for that man. It's a heartfelt testimonial. Do you feel that's an appropriate injection in this campaign of basically making the accusation that Governor Romney basically caused that woman's death." ROBERT GIBBS: "Look, Mark, I think as you said, this is an ad by an entity that's not controlled by the campaign. I certainly don't know the specifics of this man's case" (MSNBC's "Morning Joe," 8/8/12)
 CNN'S JOHN BERMAN: "He's suggesting she died because of the action that Mitt Romney took. Mitt Romney of course had left Bain years before that Bain took over this company and then his wife died years after. What's going on? Is that accurate? Is that fair?" CUTTER: "Well John, here are the facts. I don't know the facts about when Mr. Soptic's wife got sick, or the facts about his health insurance, but here's what I do know. That Mitt Romney personally handled the deal to take over GS Steel and he personally handled some of the decisions made to load that company up with debt so much that it went underwater.  It went bankrupt." (CNN, 8/8/12)
 PSAKI: "We have no involvement with any ads that are done by Priorities USA, we don't have any knowledge of the story of the family. And you know campaign finance rules in that regard are in place for a reason." (CNN's "The Situation Room," 8/7/12)
