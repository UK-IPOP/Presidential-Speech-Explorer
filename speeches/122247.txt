Ted Cruz says he has "never met anybody—any conservative—who wants to ban contraceptives."
Hey, Ted? Let us introduce you to one conservative trying to limit access to contraception. His name is Ted Cruz.
Here are five times—and counting—Cruz has personally tried to make it harder for women to get birth control:
He scored this endorsement for his efforts:
Under the Affordable Care Act, millions of women are now getting birth control without a co-pay. Ted Cruz not only wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act—he celebrated the Hobby Lobby ruling that allowed CEOs of for-profit corporations to decide whether or not to cover birth control for their employees.
Or having an abortion.
Ted Cruz wants to be president (and he's got as much of a shot as any of the Republican candidates). But he not only refuses to face the truth that women's health and rights are under attack in this country -- he has a long record of trying to limit access to birth control (and ban abortion, and cut women off from preventive care). That's what's at stake in 2016.
