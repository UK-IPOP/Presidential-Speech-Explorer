 "During the first half of the debate, showed off the best of himself -- dedicated, sincere, patriotic, cheery, earnest, commanding--all without seeming old or anxious. Even scored some points in the 'change' category, against the candidate who has owned the theme. Clear, upbeat, and totally on message."

 "It was by far McCain's best performance of the three debates. ... It was by far McCain's most aggressive, assertive." (CNN, 10/15/08) 
 "This time, John McCain kept Barack Obama on the defensive. The feisty Republican tried hard to find a lifeline Wednesday night, challenging his Democratic rival at every turn over his truthfulness, associations and record. By that measure, McCain won the last debate of the 2008 campaign." (Liz Sidoti, "McCain Puts Obama On The Defensive,"

 "I thought John McCain had a very strong night. I thought it was his best debate, clearly." (MSNBC's "Post Debate Analysis," 10/15/08) 
 "I thought it was a stronger night for McCain, though, than the last debate, and he got in some licks, like the one that Dan was talking about where he said you know, if you wanted to run against George Bush you should have run four years ago. I think he brought up Joe The Plumber and used that quite effectively for most of the times he brought it up, which was a lot of times. So a stronger performance from McCain." (CBS's "Presidential Debate," 10/15/08) 
 "I would agree this was not Obama's best debate." (CNN, 10/15/08) 
 "John McCain finally got to say tonight I am not George W. Bush. ... That was his best line. That's the line he has been waiting to say." (CNN, 10/15/08) 
 "I thought that McCain had the best start than he's had in any debate. The first 30 minutes I thought he excelled, I thought he played very well to his base. Obama started to look, I thought, flat." (CNN, 10/15/08)

 "It was interesting -- my only thought, when he said that, first of all, very good line." (ABC News' "Vote 08: The Final Debate," 10/15/08) 
 "McCain's best line of attack in this debate: Obama talks about bipartisanship but doesn't get it done." (Chris Cillizza, "The Fix Twitters The Final Debate!"
