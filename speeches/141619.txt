Pool Reports by 
, 
Good morning to all on a glorious, sunny morning from the White House. I'll be your print pooler for this morning's departure. President Biden and first lady Jill Biden are scheduled to depart the White House from the Ellipse for Wilmington at 10:10am. Pool has been called to gather at the stakeout location at 9:40am.
Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions for me.
The motorcade pulled up to the Ellipse at 10:07am. POTUS and FLOTUS got out of the car about a minute later and walked to Marine One without stopping to talk to reporters, who were staged a good distance away. A few aides walked behind them â€” your pooler could not identify the travelers. Marine One lifted off for JBA at 10:13am.
Handing off to travel pool.
The White House passes the following along:
Traveling with the President to Wilmington:
Annie Tomasini, Assistant to the President & Director of Oval Office Operations
Anthony Bernal, Assistant to the President & Advisor to the First Lady
Sasha Baker, Special Assistant to the President & Senior Director for Strategic Planning for the National Security Council
Vedant Patel, Assistant Press Secretary
Your pooler is reminded that POTUS is taking Marine One straight to DANG, not stopping at JBA. Apologies for the error in pool report #2.
