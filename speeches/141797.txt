Pool Reports by 
, 
Good morning from a quiet White House, where your pooler has been tested and wristband-ed and is currently watching a male Northern Cardinal attempt to woo a skeptical female in front of the sticks. He’s not immediately successful, but clearly determined.
President Biden is in Wilmington this morning, with nothing on his public schedule until his return to the White House this evening.
We have a brunch lid — lunch is for weekdays — until 8.30 p.m.
In-town pool gathering for Marine One at 8.45 p.m.
Also, the White House requests that your pooler pass along this note for tomorrow:
In-town pool gathering at the stakeout.
After a bit of a schlep, the pool has gathered for Marine One at the Ellipse.
Beneath a waxing crescent moon and a scattering of clouds, Marine One touched down at 9.08 p.m.
President Biden and the First Lady exited Marine One three minutes later. The president did not respond to questions from the pool as he walked to an awaiting SUV.
Correction to previous report: The Ellipse, not the South Lawn. (Your pooler, new to helicopter landings, thought it was all the same big lawn.)
That’s a travel/photo lid from your in-town pooler at 9.23 p.m. — night!
