 Do you ever rest? Do you people ever rest?



What are you asking for from Chuck Schumer?

 Well, if we could make a deal, at least on a temporary basis, because Obamacare is exploding; it's gone. The premiums are through the roof. You see what's happening. So if we could make a temporary deal, because ultimately we're going to hand it back to the States—we're going to block grant back to the States.

But if we made a temporary deal, I think it would be a great thing for people, but it's really up to him. Obamacare is a disaster. The numbers are out. It's exploding like I said it would. So basically, if we could do a 1-year deal or a 2-year deal as a temporary measure, you'll have block granting ultimately to the States, which is what the Republicans want. That really is a repeal and replace.

What about your Chief of Staff John Kelly?

 John Kelly is one of the best people I've ever worked with. He's doing an incredible job, and he told me for the last 2 months he loves it more than anything he's ever done.

He's a military man, but he loves doing this, which is Chief of Staff, more than anything he's ever done. He's doing a great job. He will be here, in my opinion, for the entire 7 remaining years.

[

 No, no. He likes Secretary Tillerson; so do I. We have a very good relationship. We disagree on a couple of things. Sometimes, I'd like him to be a little bit tougher, but other than that, we have a very good relationship.

 Well, he says they were in a—[

 That's locker room. That's locker room.

Go ahead.

 Well, we're going to see what happens. We're going to see what happens.

So now I am going to the really great State—a State that I love—of North Carolina. And I'll see you later. Go home and rest.
