I WAS SHOCKED to hear of the sudden death of President Nasser. The world has lost an outstanding leader who tirelessly and devotedly served the causes of his countrymen and the Arab world. This tragic loss requires that all nations, and particularly those in the Middle East, renew their efforts to calm passions, reach for mutual understanding, and build lasting peace. On behalf of the American people, I extend deep sympathy to his family and to his people.
