From WH official: This afternoon, President Biden will speak with retailers and infant formula manufacturers to receive an update on efforts to make infant formula supply more available to American families. Later this afternoon, the White House will announce additional actions the Administration is taking to address this issue.
From the White House:
The press briefing will begin at 3:30pm today.
From a White House official: Tomorrow, the President will meet with local elected officials, chiefs of police, and a community violence intervention expert from cities across America that have benefited from using American Rescue Plan funding to increase spending on community policing and public safety programs. In the afternoon, the President will also deliver remarks calling for state and local leaders to invest more American Rescue Plan funding in making our communities safer — and to deploy those dollars quickly.
At 3:40, we have a two-minute warning for the 223nd and penultimate daily press briefing in what historians call the Jen Psaki Era. The count of 223 for Psaki in the 477-day-old Biden presidency comes courtesy of Martha Kumar, possessor of the best White House numbers in town. That tops the total of briefings by all four press secretaries in the previous administration. Kumar puts the Spicer-Sanders-Grisham-McEnany count at 205 briefings.
The briefing that started at 3:43 concluded at 4:35.
In the 52-minute session, Jen Psaki answered 58 questions from 21 reporters. So, for this press secretary, it is 223 down and one to go.
The pool is gathering for the ASEAN dinner.
A very brief photo op on the South Lawn with only a hint of news to come later. The hint came when President Biden was asked if he had any message on the infant formula shortage. He responded, "Yes. But not on this occasion. I just spent a couple hours on the phone." Double check with the White House transcript in case any words were missed on the end when his voice tailed off.
The president emerged from the White House at 5:51. He led the ten visiting leaders across the grass to a slightly raised platform that proclaimed "2022 U.S. – ASEAN Special Summit 2022." On the platform, the president was in the middle flanked by the other leaders. When the family photo was taken, the President said, "Okay" and then deflected the lone question on the infant formula. He was back in the White House at 5:54.
Here is the White House list of the leaders:
