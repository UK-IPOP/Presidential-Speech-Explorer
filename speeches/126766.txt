When Donald Trump Cut and Run From a Fort Lauderdale Project, Floridians Were Left on the Hook 

  The buyers at Trump International Hotel & Tower said they thought they were getting a ticket to an exclusive club, a highrise developed by Donald Trump offering a five-star restaurant, $3 million penthouses and sweeping views of the Atlantic Ocean.
What they actually got: a hulking, empty concrete shell that was built by someone else, and ran out of money long before it was completed.

  "It was an outright lie," said J. Michael Goodson, a buyer and former Wall Street investment banker who has pending litigation against the real estate mogul. "I thought the last thing Donald Trump would do was walk away."


  In addition, many investors agreed to buy units only because they believed Trump had a stake in the project.
The Pembroke Pines lawyer points to dozens of brochures, letters with Trump's signature and other promotional materials that gave his clients the impression the billionaire was in charge.
"Here," he said in a recent interview. "The letter says, 'It is with great pleasure that I present my latest development.' How were they supposed to know he wasn't the developer? He said this is 'my development.' I was representing them, and I even thought he was the developer."
