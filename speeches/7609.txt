My dear Robert:
I am glad to have your formal report on the efficiency of Billy Opossum--it will be incorporated into his service record. Precautions [p.220] will be taken to maintain his health and spirits for the further needs of the Prince Georges County High School teams.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Robert M. Venemann, Hyattsville High School, Hyattsville, Md.]
