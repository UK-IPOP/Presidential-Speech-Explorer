The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 3086.

This bill would extend to 
 employees the same appeal rights in adverse personnel actipns that are held by 
. The bill is unnecessary in view of existing administrative protections provided employees in the excepted service. The Administration believes that the distinction between the competitive civil service and the excepted service regarding appeal rights should be preserved.
