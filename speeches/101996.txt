Today, the President called on Congress to create a new Small Business Lending Fund. Under this proposal, $30 billion in TARP funds would be transferred, through legislation, to a new program outside of TARP to support small business lending. This new program complements other SBA lending initiatives the President has already announced - including support for higher SBA loan limits and extending Recovery Act provisions for higher loan guarantees and temporary fee eliminations - as well as tax cuts to encourage small businesses to invest, hire and raise their workers' salaries. These efforts for small business are a critical part of the President's overall approach to supporting job creation.
The Administration's core proposal would be to use the Small Business Lending Fund to offer capital investments to community and smaller banks with an incentive structure to support new small business lending, as described below. The Administration is open to other designs for the fund, and will discuss ideas with Congress in the coming days and weeks.
One potential design for the proposal discussed above is the following:
Bank A, with $500 million in risk-weighted assets, held $250 million in business loans the end of every quarter of 2009. In 2010, it applies for and receives approval to draw capital equal to 5% of its risk-weighted assets from the Small Business Lending Fund (the maximum allowable).
After drawing $25 million in capital from the fund, Bank A increased its stock of outstanding small business loans to $275 million by the end of two years (a 10% increase over the baseline). As a result, while it received capital with an initial dividend rate of 5%, that dividend rate would be decreased to 1%. The 1% dividend would then be locked-in, and the bank would benefit from this attractive rate for the following three years.
