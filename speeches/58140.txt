The purpose of this Statement of Administration Policy is to express the Administration's views on H.R. 5368, the FY 1993 Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Bill. Although the Committee bill would provide important assistance to the republics of the former Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe, it proposes a number of funding reductions, earmarks, and language provisions that would seriously undermine the Administration's ability to carry out foreign policy.

The Administration remains opposed to funding included in the bill for the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). UNFPA supports a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization in China. Because the UNFPA provision would weaken current law or regulation with respect to abortion-related activities, the President would veto the bill as reported by the Committee.

The Administration opposes H.R. 5368 in its current form because of the UNFPA provision and other serious objections outlined below. However, the Administration hopes that the bill will move forward through the legislative process so that necessary changes could he made to gain Administration support for its final passage.

Serious objections include:

The extensive micromanagement throughout the committee bill would thwart efforts to execute in a meaningful and rational manner the limited resources that would be provided by the bill. Over three-quarters of the major economic assistance accounts are earmarked. The vast array of country, program, project, and contractor earmarks, compounded by sizeable funding reductions, not only distorts the Administration's request but also would deny the Administration the flexibility to carry out U.S. foreign policy.
