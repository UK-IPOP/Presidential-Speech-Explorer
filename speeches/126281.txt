Today, presidential candidate Ted Cruz laid out his Jobs, Freedom, Security plan for restoring jobs, economic growth and opportunity, protecting our constitutional freedoms, and keeping Americans safe from the threat of Islamic terrorism.
In his remarks, Cruz quoted President John F. Kennedy, "Let me read to you from a President of the United States. This President in an address to the nation said, 'Our tax rates in short are so high as to weaken the very essence of the progress of a free society. For these reasons, this administration intends to cut taxes in order to build the fundamental strength of our economy—to remove a serious barrier to long-term growth.

"If I am elected President, we will repeal every word of Obamacare," Cruz continued. "We'll pass common sense healthcare reform that makes health insurance personal and portable and affordable and keeps government from getting in between us and our doctors.
