'We love our vets,' he said." (

"In January, Donald Trump skipped a televised Republican debate in Iowa and held his own event instead — a rally to raise money for veterans. Trump said it was a huge success. 'One hour. Six million dollars,' Trump told a campaign rally in Iowa a few days later, boasting about the total money raised. He listed more than 20 groups that would receive money. 'These people that get these checks are amazing people, amazing people.' More than a month later, about half of the money, roughly $3 million, has been donated to veterans' charities, according to a summary released Thursday by the Trump campaign in response to inquiries from The Washington Post."
