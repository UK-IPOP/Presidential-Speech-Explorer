"Four years after promising Wisconsinites he would deliver change to Washington, President Obama is back in the state with a different message — he can't deliver the change he promised. The candidate of 'yes, we can' has become the president of 'no, I can't.' As president, Mitt Romney will deliver the change necessary to fix Washington and get our country back on track by delivering 12 million new jobs and higher take-home pay for American workers." — Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 OBAMA: "But I've been there long enough to know this - if we want a government that puts the needs of middle-class families before the whims of lobbyists and politicians; if we want to grow this economy and prevent a crisis like this from ever happening again, then the ways of Washington must change. We must reform our lobbyist-driven politics. We must reform the waste and abuse in our government." (Senator Barack Obama,
