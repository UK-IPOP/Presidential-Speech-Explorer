The United States and Japan, as the world's two largest democratic economies, resolve to promote prosperity and to strengthen the rules-based economic order in the Indo-Pacific region and the world. Together, the two countries recognize the progress made under the U.S.-Japan Competitiveness and Resilience (CoRe) Partnership announced in April 2021 and commit to broaden and deepen bilateral economic cooperation including through the Economic Policy Consultative Committee announced in January 2022.
The United States and Japan committed to strengthen further our vibrant people-to-people ties by expanding collaboration and participation in research projects and international exchange programs. Our exchange programs will continue to distribute the benefits of the CoRe Partnership inclusively and equitably, to empower women in our societies. Exchange programs have engaged civil society, and the public and private sectors to encourage women's role in the business sector, government, and STEM fields.
