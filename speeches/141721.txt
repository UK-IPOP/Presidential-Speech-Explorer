Marine 1 came in from around the Washington Monument in the cool evening and set down on the grass of the Ellipse at 1927.
President Biden, accompanied by First Lady Jill Biden, stepped off the helicopter two minutes later and, with a wave to the assembled pool, moved to the waiting SUV for the short ride up to the White House.
Per the WH press office:
Returning with the President and the First Lady:
Annie Tomasini, Assistant to the President & Director of Oval Office Operations
Anthony Bernal, Assistant to the President & Advisor to the First Lady
Sasha Baker, Special Assistant to the President & Senior Director for Strategic Planning for the National Security Council
At 1940 the WH press office declared a travel/photo lid for the day.
Have a good Sunday evening, all.
