"For more than three years, President Obama's rhetoric and record have left Nevada's job creators in a bind. Instead of pushing pro-growth policies that will help improve our economy, President Obama has repeatedly made it harder for businesses to grow, thrive, and create new jobs. As president, Mitt Romney will get to work on day one to give job creators the confidence they need to put Americans back to work." –Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 "But Nevada state officials and residents of this economically ravaged state are still fuming over comments they perceived as rants against the tourism industry. Las Vegas city leaders have been feuding with [President Obama] over the comments since he first made them two years ago..." (Cristina Silva, "Las Vegas Fumes Over Obama's Anti-Tourism Rant,"

 OBAMA: "This isn't how responsible families do their budgets. When times are tough, you tighten your belts. ... You don't go buying a boat when you can barely pay your mortgage. You don't blow a bunch of cash in Vegas when you're trying to save for college. You prioritize. You make tough choices. And it's time your government did the same." (President Barack Obama, 
, Nashua, NH, 2/2/10)
"Michael Bonner, chairman of the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce, said Obama's critics read too much into his Vegas comments. 'There was a measurable impact on convention and trade business following those comments, but the intent of the president was certainly not to damage the economy here,' said Bonner, who has donated to Democratic and Republican candidates in recent years."

 "'We've had about six major groups cancel,' said Karen Gordon, president of the destination management company Activity Planners in Las Vegas.

 REID: "I just spoke to the White House and told them that while the president is correct that people saving for college need to be fiscally responsible, the president needs to lay off Las Vegas and stop making it the poster child for where people shouldn't be spending their money. ... To truly reenergize our economy, we need people to travel to Las Vegas. I would much rather tourists and business travelers spend their money in Las Vegas than spend it overseas."

 "Not only the rate, but the raw numbers have declined, he said. In 1977, SBA figures show, Americans started 563,325 businesses with employees. In 2009, despite an increase in the population, they started 403,765. And no previous valleys dipped so low.

 "By contrast, President Obama's proposal yesterday (see below) to cut the corporate rate to 28% from 35% wouldn't apply to this 'pass-through' business income. It would thus favor big corporations at the expense of smaller businesses that file as individuals and would see their marginal rate rise to 41% or more under Mr. Obama's plan to raise individual tax rates."

 "As part of the explanation for the general economic pessimism, 78 percent of small businesses believe that taxation, regulation and legislation from Washington make it harder for businesses to hire more employees — and 74 percent blame the recent health care reforms passed by the Obama administration for creating an impediment to job creation."
