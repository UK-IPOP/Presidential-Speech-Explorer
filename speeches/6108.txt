Warning is hereby expressly given to all persons not to make settlement upon the lands reserved by this proclamation.
The reservation hereby established shall be known as the Shasta Forest Reserve.
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed. Done at the city of Washington this 3d day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and five, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and thirtieth.
