"If President Obama's Ohio campaign promises sounded familiar for Americans struggling to find good-paying jobs, it's because we've heard it all before. After more than three years of failed economic policies, President Obama has left Americans with fewer jobs, declining incomes, and skyrocketing expenses." –Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 OBAMA: "If you're willing to work hard, you should be able to find a good job. If you're willing to meet your responsibilities, you should be able to own a home, maybe start a business, give your children the chance to do even better -- no matter who you are, or where you come from, or what you look like, or what your last name is."

 OBAMA: "I will use half of what we're no longer spending on war to pay down the deficit, and the other half to repair our roads and our bridges, our runways and our wireless networks. That's the choice in this election -- to rebuild America." (President Barack Obama, Remarks, Columbus, OH, 5/5/12)
 
 A January 2010 Associated Press analysis of Recovery Act spending on roads and bridges 'had no effect on local unemployment and only barely helped the beleaguered construction industry,' regardless of how many dollars lawmakers threw at the various projects."

 OBAMA: "Too many of our friends, too many of our neighbors are still hurting because of this crisis. I've heard from too many people wondering why they haven't been able to get one of the jobs that have been created; why their home is still under water; why their family hasn't yet been touched by the recovery." (President Barack Obama, Remarks, Columbus, OH, 5/5/12)
 "But there's trouble looming on another front: the housing market's still struggling, especially in states key to his reelection prospects. Four of the biggest battlegrounds — Michigan, Florida, California and Nevada — are among the top 10 states with the highest foreclosure rates. Ohio, central to every presidential campaign, is ranked at number 11." (Joseph Williams, "Foreclosures May Dog Obama,"

 "Nearly a quarter of Ohio homeowners were drowning in mortgage debt at the end of last year, based on figures from housing data tracker, CoreLogic. That was slightly higher than the U.S. rate of about 23 percent of all residential properties. Nationally, that means about 11 million homeowners are under water. Ohio has the nation's ninth highest percentage of mortgages under water." (Randy Tucker, "Mortgages Exceeding Home Values, Restraining Growth,"
