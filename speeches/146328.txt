After Congress passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal, the Biden Administration launched a campaign to promote the infrastructure package and highlight what it means for the American people.
President Biden visited the Port of Baltimore to showcase how the legislation will ease supply chain blockages. And, Cabinet Members and senior administration officials hit the ground running. They flooded local TV airwaves, hosted media briefings, and outlined their first steps to implement the legislation so that it delivers results for middle class families across America, grow a competitive economy for years to come, and create good-paying, union jobs. The White House also convened more than a dozen briefings with over 4,000 leaders across the country â€“ Governors, Mayors, state legislators, Members of Congress, union members, business leaders, and more.
After the President signs the bill into law next week, he will travel to New Hampshire and Michigan to continue underscoring the benefits the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal delivers to the American people, and key agencies and administration leaders will continue formulating plans to quickly deliver and communicate about the historic legislation.
