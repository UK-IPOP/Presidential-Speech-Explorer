EVERETT DIRKSEN was one of a kind--and a remarkably likable man. To politics and government he brought a dedication matched by few and a style and eloquence matched by no political leader in our time.
He had his greatest moments as the leader of the loyal opposition. In the history of that role in the Congress, he had unequaled influence and accomplishment.
He will be remembered as a giant in the history of Congress and as one who on the great issues always placed the Nation first. I mourn the loss of this great Americana legislator of matchless skills, and my warm personal friend since my first days in the Congress 22 years ago.
