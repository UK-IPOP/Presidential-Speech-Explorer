 This year, Thanksgiving will mean more than it ever has before.
 So many have given their time, their talent——
 ——their bravery, their sacrifice, and courage to keep this country strong. Some believe it's astonishing; I believe it's the American character.
 As your family gathers, give thanks, and think of all that can be done in your community.
 Thanks for making such a difference. Thanks for giving.
God bless you, and God bless America.
