This week, President Biden delivered four major wins to advance our nation's climate, environmental justice, and conservation goals while lowering energy costs for Americans.
Using funding from the Inflation Reduction Act, the U.S. Postal Service 
 an historic $9.6 billion investment to put 66,000 electric delivery trucks on the roads over the next five years and acquire only electric Next Generation Delivery Vehicles starting in 2026.
In another win for clean air, the Environmental Protection Agency 
 the strongest-ever standards to cut smog- and soot-forming emissions from heavy-duty trucks. EPA estimates that the new standards will result in 18,000 fewer cases of childhood asthma and 1.1 fewer lost school days by 2045.
The Department of Energy also 
 stronger efficiency standards for light bulbs to conserve energy and cut energy bills. With this announcement, the Administration has now taken more than 110 actions this year to strengthen energy efficiency standards and save the average family at least $100 annually.
The Administration also secured a 
 for conservation and biodiversity, with countries across the globe reaching a historic agreement to collectively commit to conserving at least 30 percent of lands and waters by 2030, a goal that President Biden committed the U.S. to during his first days in office.
"Nearly two years ago, USPS announced that just 10 percent of their new delivery fleet would be electric vehicles. In the time since that announcement, I have repeatedly called for the Postal Service to do more with the opportunity in front of them. By transitioning our aging fleet to electrified vehicles, we can reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions and save taxpayer dollars in the long run. There is a clear reason why so many private competitors are electrifying their fleets—it is good for business and is the smart choice for the future." [

 "If we want to spark a clean energy revolution across America, we have to start by swapping out the spark plugs in our federal fleets. Today's announcement from USPS is a victory for all of us who have driven the effort to supercharge the electrification of our mail delivery vehicles so that we can save money and save the planet. Electrification of the Postal Service kicks our progress toward meeting our climate goals into high gear—reducing greenhouse gas emissions, keeping our communities healthy, and investing in American clean energy manufacturing."

 "I'm pleased that the U.S. Postal Service has listened to our calls to substantially increase their efforts to electrify the next generation of mail delivery vehicles. With funding that Democrats delivered in the historic Inflation Reduction Act and a commitment from the Biden administration, the next generation of mail delivery vehicles in America will now be 75% battery electric vehicles, and 100% electric starting in 2026. Electrifying the transportation sector is among our greatest opportunities to tackle the climate crisis, clean up the air in our neighborhoods, provide a responsible return on taxpayer dollars, and send a powerful signal that the United States is leading in the transition toward a clean, efficient, and electric future."

 "As Chair of the Oversight Committee, electrifying the Postal Service fleet has been one of my top priorities. I am proud that the Postal Service made this important decision after my many discussions with the Postmaster General about the importance of adopting an all-electric fleet. This is a win for the Postal Service, the climate, and the American people. This acquisition is also a testament to President Biden's efforts to combat climate change and create a world in which future generations can thrive in. I applaud the Postal Service for this decision, and I look forward to the steps Congress and the Administration will continue to take to protect our planet." [

 "Thanks to the hard work of the Biden-Harris administration and funding from the historic Inflation Reduction Act, we're thrilled that the U.S. Postal Service is finally delivering clean energy, just in time for the holidays. With more electric mail trucks on the streets and charging stations at post offices across the country, this investment will mean cleaner air for our children and families, major progress toward our climate goals, and a clear example of clean energy benefits for the nation and the world. We're encouraged by this quick and effective use of Inflation Reduction Act funds and look forward to continued work with the Biden-Harris administration to ensure the landmark climate law is implemented boldly, swiftly, and equitably." [

 "Every neighborhood, every household in America deserves to have electric USPS trucks delivering clean air with their mail, and today's announcement takes us almost all the way there. The Postal Service's shift to only purchasing electric mail trucks within five years is the marker of a sea change in the federal fleet as the country looks to an electric future. We're grateful to the Biden Administration for stepping in to put us on course for an electric future." [

 "We're pleased the Postal Service has listened to community and environmental justice organizations clamoring for zero emission mail trucks. We look forward to working with USPS to ensure communities hardest hit by pollution get these trucks on their streets first." [Statement, 12/20/22]
 "Clean post office delivery trucks are coming soon, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act. The immediate purchase order for 60,000 electric vehicles will save money for the Postal Service while reducing deadly diesel pollution in our neighborhoods. The fact that 100% of new delivery trucks will be electric vehicles starting in 2026 shows we can clean up unhealthy air pollution and save money on fuel. This decision is in keeping with the Biden administration's whole-of-government approach to cutting climate pollution. It uses the purchasing power of the American People to spur innovation, create jobs, and save consumers money. Private sector companies, including Amazon and Pepsi, have already announced moves to zero emissions electric vehicles because they know it is the best choice for their business. EDF has strongly advocated for increased clean vehicles adoption by the Postal Service to kick that transition into high gear. This announcement comes just hours after EPA announced its Clean Trucks Plan, which includes a commitment to issue proposed standards in March of next year that will help accelerate zero-emission truck deployment relying on game changing investments in the new climate law. Once again, President Biden's leadership is showing real results for the American people and our climate." [

: "This is an extraordinary step by USPS and the Biden Administration to advance the electrification of the federal fleet. USPS has the largest fleet in the federal government and reaches across our nation with some of the most recognizable vehicles on the road. Postal routes are predictable and include ample charging time to meet the fleet's power needs. Transitioning these older, inefficient vehicles to EVs will not only serve as a visual reminder of their value and reliability but will also provide public health, environmental, and economic benefits to our communities." [Statement, 12/20/22]
 "The Biden-Harris administration has taken historic steps to transportation electrification, including passing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act earlier this year. This move further signals that electricity will power not only the next generation of passenger vehicles but also medium- and heavy-duty vehicles. Americans can look forward to receiving their daily mail from cleaner, quieter, and more efficient vehicles." [Statement, 12/20/22]
 "EPA's new final rule to limit truck pollution is an important step to clean up emissions, especially for Americans who live near a highway, truck stop, port or distribution center. This new rule will significantly reduce nitrogen oxide emissions for new heavy-duty vehicles and prevent up to 2,900 premature deaths a year. The Lung Association and the health community have long called for EPA to finalize strong standards to reduce nitrogen oxides from heavy-duty vehicles, and then to write future rules to drive a nationwide transition to zero-emission trucks, buses and other heavy-duty vehicles. Today's final rule is a step forward to curb dangerous pollution." [

 "The LEDs on today's store shelves are a great product, but it turns out the best technology can make the bulbs even more efficient. We use so many light bulbs that this improvement would meaningfully reduce energy costs for households and businesses while cutting climate pollution from power plants. This plan would also mark the end of an era for compact fluorescent bulbs, which are still sold in some stores today but are inferior to LEDs." [

: "The last two weeks in Montreal placed nature at the forefront of global policy discussions. The agreement struck today among the participating 196 countries could mark a turning point in mending our broken relationship with nature. It includes a new funding mechanism for helping the developing world reach its goals, and it also commits parties to delivering against the 30 by 30 vision that puts Indigenous peoples and local communities at the center of that work. Now the hard work begins. Ultimately this agreement will be judged on the strength of its implementation. It's up to governments, businesses, and other actors to turn its goals into concrete outcomes, and to build on their ambition where needed. In the US, we take heart that – though our country is not a party to the underlying convention – the Biden Administration has already embraced many of the principles of the agreement. We at WWF-US look forward to working with the US government, companies, and other partners to make sure the US does its part toward achieving a nature positive future." [
