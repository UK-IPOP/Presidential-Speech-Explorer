THE APPOINTMENT of the National Advisory Council is further proof of our determination that the war on poverty will be a citizen's war. The members of the Council will serve the public in reviewing, evaluating, and helping to improve the Government's antipoverty efforts.
The Council will recommend to the Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity changes and improvements which should be made in our antipoverty programs, and report to me and to the Congress concerning its findings and recommendations.
In establishing this Council, the Congress has expanded the opportunities for full public participation and involvement in the war on poverty--a war that can be won only through the efforts of a unified and dedicated people.
