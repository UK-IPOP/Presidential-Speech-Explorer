Marco Rubio has a proven track record when it comes to taking care of our veterans, leading the way to push through meaningful reforms in the Senate that will improve conditions for those who served our nation. I am supporting him because I know that when he is President, he will continue to build upon those efforts and ensure that those who have sacrificed for America receive the best care when they come home.
Throughout his career, protecting those who have worn our country's uniform has been a top priority for Marco Rubio, and I know he will continue that as President. In addition to taking care of those who carry the physical and invisible wounds of war, Marco has the foreign policy experience to keep our country safe which is why I'm proud to be voting for him.
Our campaign is honored to have earned the support of these brave individuals who selflessly served our country. Throughout this campaign, Marco has not only highlighted what he has done on behalf of veterans, but stressed that we must improve the care that we offer them. We are proud that these heroic service-members will be a part of Marco's team to spread that message across Alabama.
