 Mr. President, what made you use the word "genocide" today?
Mr. President, have you seen enough evidence to declare genocide in Ukraine, sir?
 Yes, I called it genocide because it's become clearer and clearer that Putin is just trying to wipe out the idea of even being able to be a Ukrainian.
And the mount—the evidence is mounting. It's different than it was last week. The—more evidence is coming out of the—literally, the horrible things that the Russians have done in Ukraine. And we're going to only learn more and more about the devastation.
And we'll let the lawyers decide internationally whether or not it qualifies, but it sure seems that way to me.
Thank you.
What more did you learn?
Will the U.S. escalate its response, sir?
