 Mr. President?
 Coach, congratulations.
 Well, thank you very much. You know, we're from neighboring States. I'm a Mississippi boy.
 You are?
 Yes, I am.
 Well, double congratulations.
 Well, thank you very much.
 I'll tell you what, I've followed the season this year. I've watched several games on television. I've really enjoyed it, and I had a chance to get to know some of the players in the league when I went running with the women's Olympic team a couple of years ago, and I think it's just been a great thing. I hope it'll be a success and go forward. And you had a great season and a great team, and you had a good game tonight.
 Well, thank you very much. I do appreciate you taking the time to call our locker room. That means a lot to the women of this team and to this coaching staff.
 Can you hear me?
 Yes, I can hear you.
 We're on a cell phone, but I think we're doing all right. I can hear you fine.
 Yes. I do appreciate your support of women's athletics in general.
 Well, I'm strongly supportive of it, and I hope thatâ€”like I said, I want you to stay with it, and I'll be supporting you all the way, and congratulate the players for me.
 I will. They're all in the dressing room, and they will be honored that you have called us.
 Cynthia had a great game, and any of us who has ever been through a childbirth were awful impressed when Sheryl Swoopes came back to play so quickly.
 Yes. I'm amazed that she was able to have a child and come back and play for us. Cynthia's had some great games. This has just been a total team effort for us.
 Yes. Well, give them my best, and I hope to see you up here someday pretty soon.
 Okay. I would love to come up there.
 Thank you, Van.
 And thank you very much for calling us. I'm very honored.
 Bye-bye.
