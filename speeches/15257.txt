Dear Ray:
I have examined with much interest the material you sent me with your letter of December 12, 1951, concerning the policies and procedures of the Housing Agency with respect to the integrity of its operations. You are to be commended for the attention you have given to this matter.
Because of the general public interest in this subject at the present time, I believe your letter should be made public as an example of the manner in which this problem has been dealt with in the past, and is now being dealt with, by the Government.
I think the policy you have set out with respect to the acceptance of gifts by employees is a wise one, and I believe that this is the correct policy for all of the Government.

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN

[Honorable Raymond M. Foley, Administrator, Housing and Home Finance Agency, Washington, D.C.]
