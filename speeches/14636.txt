Recognizing the fact that in carrying the war into enemy territory, we shall need greater amounts of money than any nation has ever asked from its citizens in all history, 
, President of the United States of America, do officially proclaim that on Thursday, the ninth of September, 1943, the Third War Loan shall be launched.
As Commander-in-Chief, I hereby invoke every citizen to give all possible aid and support to this Third War Loan drive, not only so that our financial goal may be reached, but to encourage and inspire those of our husbands and fathers and sons who are under fire on a dozen fronts all over the world. It is my earnest hope that every American will realize that in buying War Bonds in this Third War Loan he has an opportunity to express voluntarily and under the guidance of his conscience, the extent to which he will "back the attack."
The American people supported well the first and second War Loan drives and in fact did even more than was asked of them. Our need for money now is greater than ever, and will continue to grow until the very day that Victory is won; so we must ask far more sacrifice, far more cooperation than ever before.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington, this 26th day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-eighth.
FRANKLIN D ROOSEVELT
