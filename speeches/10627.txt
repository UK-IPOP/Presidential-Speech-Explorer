My dear Dr. Bowlby:
I am interested to learn that the Lord's Day Alliance of the United States will celebrate its forty-third anniversary on December 6th-7th. Its vigilant work in promoting reverent respect for the Sabbath Day is a potent factor in preserving the sacredness of that Day against secularization.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
