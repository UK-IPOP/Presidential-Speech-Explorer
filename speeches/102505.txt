. Well, Mr. President—I was telling the President, and I think the delegation would agree, that this was the most spectacular ceremony for a state visit that we've been involved with since we've traveled. And I was saying that I especially enjoyed the traditional dress of some of the soldiers.
. But traditional uniforms are quite difficult to fight in. [

. That's true, that's true.
. Well, first of all, Mr. President, welcome. And you're bringing very nice weather with you, because up until yesterday it was subzeros, frigid cold. [

Well, once again, Mr. President, welcome to the Asian region, and of course, welcome to Korea. I know that your visit to Japan and China has been very successful. And, Mr. President, as we all like to say, you saved the best for last. [
]
. Well, Mr. President, let me just say that we have been so gratified by the warmth with which we've been received here in the Republic of Korea. And I think there's every indication that the alliance between our two countries has never been stronger.
