A LANDMARK in the history of labor-management relations in the United States--
Both sides for many years have been concerned about the problems deeply affecting the livelihood of the men who run the trains and the future of the industry itself. I am sure the American people applaud as I do the high principle which has brought railway labor and management together in this agreement which adds greatly to the substance of the fabric of our free enterprise system.
Certainly this agreement is living proof that free collective bargaining is successful if left in the hands of dedicated, capable men who desire to see it work. It is also another indication of the maturity that has been achieved in industrial relations in this country in recent years.
