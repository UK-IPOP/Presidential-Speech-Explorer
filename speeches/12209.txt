 the Congress by joint resolution of May 18, 1928 (45 Stat. 617), has authorized and requested the President of the United States to issue annually a proclamation setting apart May 1 as Child Health Day; and
 safeguarding the health of children is protecting the vitality of the Nation; and
 during the past year the Federal Government has been cooperating with the State and local governments in extending and improving child-health services:
, President of the United States of America, on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the Children's Bureau of the United States Department of Labor, do hereby designate the first day of May of this year as Child Health Day, and do call upon the people of the United States on that day to consider and appraise child-health conditions and the community organization for child health, and to plan for health protection for every child during the coming year; and I call upon the children to celebrate the gains they have made in health during the year and to lend their aid to the community in its year-round effort to promote the health of the Nation.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this ninth day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-first.
FRANKLIN D ROOSEVELT
