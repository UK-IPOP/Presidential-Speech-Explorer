My dear Mr. Ambassador:
I must, of course, accept your resignation as Ambassador to Mexico, to be effective at the close of business March 3rd.
I wish to take this occasion to express to you the appreciation I have for the service you have rendered our country as its Ambassador to Mexico. Never have our relations been lifted to such a high point of confidence and cooperation, and there is no more important service in the whole foreign relations of the United States than this. A large part of it is due to your efforts, and I realize it has been done at great sacrifice to yourself. The American people should be grateful to you for it.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Hon. J. Reuben Clark, Jr., American Ambassador to Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico]
