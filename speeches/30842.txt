On this day our nation proudly honors the millions of Americans who have served in our Armed Forces both in times of war and peace.
Without the sacrifices which these brave Veterans so freely and generously made to protect our freedom, we would not be the great nation we are today. It is fitting that all Americans pause to reflect on their splendid service.
No nation has been more committed to peace than America, and no Americans have done more to achieve a lasting peace than the members of our Armed Forces, past and present. They represent the spirit that has made and preserved us as a nation.
