"This is a critical time in our nation's history," Governor Douglas said. "The challenges at home and abroad are daunting. It is imperative that the next president be ready from day one. We are fortunate that Governor Kasich seeks the presidency for he is clearly the most qualified candidate by both experience and temperament."
Governor Kasich said, "I'm grateful for the work of this remarkable team. In Vermont and beyond, more and more people are recognizing that I am the only candidate who can defeat Hillary Clinton and bring commonsense solutions to Washington. I would like to specifically thank Governor Douglas for leading the charge to lock in support from delegates in Vermont as we move into the convention in July."
