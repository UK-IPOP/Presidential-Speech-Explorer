The Vice President visited his doctors at George Washington University Hospital this afternoon for evaluation and treatment of atrial fibrillation (an abnormal rhythm involving the upper chambers of the heart) which was discovered this morning.
An electrical impulse was delivered to restore the heart to normal rhythm. The procedure went smoothly and without complication.
Earlier today the Vice President called a reception for Congressional Candidate Marty Ozinga and expressed his support.
The Vice President is home and resumed his normal schedule.
