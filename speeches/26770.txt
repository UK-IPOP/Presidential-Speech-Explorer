Mr. President and Mrs. Diori:
We are greatly honored today to welcome here to the White House one of Africa's most distinguished statesmen. President Diori Hamani of Niger is the first President of his nation. His strong and wise leadership has united farmer and herdsman, settler and nomad into one people determined to win the blessings of prosperity and freedom.
He has given his people a deep faith in democracy. In only 7 years, they have firmly set the roots of a democratic tradition. At the same time they have rolled up their sleeves and they have gone to work to improve their economic conditions.
But President Diori's good works transcend even the boundaries of his own beloved homeland. He is also President of a group of 14 African nations, who are joined together to provide for such basic needs as a postal and telecommunications system, a limited common market, and a shared airline. Our honored guest today is also President of a council of five West African neighbors who help each other with the very heavy burdens of economic development.
You have said, Mr. President, that the formula for success in your country must be "hard work, prudence, and moderation." That is a proper creed for any people. And no experience better teaches us how valid it is than the short, bright history of the land that you lead. So it is with great pleasure, Mr. President, that Mrs. Johnson and I welcome you, your lovely lady, and your distinguished associates to our shores.
We will enjoy being with you. We believe that the exchange between us will be of benefit to both of our countries and we trust, to peoples of the world.

Welcome, again, to Washington.
