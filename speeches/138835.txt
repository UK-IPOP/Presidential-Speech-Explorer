Good morning! At 9:36 a.m., before pool's 10 a.m. call time, the White House called a travel/photo lid. 


Judd Deere passes this along:

Today, President Donald J. Trump played golf with one of the great NFL players Brett Favre at Trump National Golf Club Bedminster.

Hi all - I'm told the photo of President Trump and Brett Favre didn't display correctly in the previous pool report. I've uploaded it to the link below:



Judd Deere sends this along:

This evening at Trump National Golf Club Bedminster, President Donald J. Trump will be a special guest at an event hosted by America First Action, a 527 organization not associated with any campaign or candidate.

Your pooler has reached out to America First Action and will pass along any additional details.
