WE MUST constantly protect and improve the health of our people. The time has come to call upon our best scientific and administrative talents to help chart the future in this critical area. I hope that this Conference will formulate guidelines for developing creative programs that will bring better health to every American. The mandate of this Conference will not stop at the water's edge. I will call upon it to help develop international goals in the field of health.
