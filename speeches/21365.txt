I again strongly urge you to join me in discussing the issues in this election in a fifth debate to be held shortly before the election.
Only in this way will the American people be able to evaluate the arguments and issues which are raised in the closing days of the campaign. In fact, I believe that more than five debates would be helpful if the record were to be corrected properly. If you should relent in your opposition to further debates, and I invite you to do so in tonight's debate, I hope your representatives can contact mine to work out one or more dates at the earliest opportunity.
JOHN F. KENNEDY
