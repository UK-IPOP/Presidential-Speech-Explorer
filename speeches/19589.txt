Mr. President, My Friends, and People of Paris, France:
It is always, for me, a moment of sadness when I say goodbye to Paris and to France. This country and its people have meant very much to me, and it is always a matter of regret when I must leave them.
In the past few days, my associates and I have been working very hard--the heads of government and their staffs, and Foreign Ministers of fifteen governments--all of us working for this ideal of peace, for which all people--even all the masses behind the iron curtain--have the same feelings in their hearts.
We are working to try to make this ideal a little bit closer to practicality, and I think that this group has done something to make the ideal of peace just a little bit closer--certainly the chances of war more remote.
So as I say Goodbye to Paris and to France again, I do it with a very great deal of hope for all of these people of the world that are believing--like the rest of us--that peace is the only solution for humankind.
Thank you again, Mr. President.
