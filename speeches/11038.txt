My dear Mrs. Bliss:
I am profoundly grieved at the death of my dear friend your husband, and Mrs. Hoover and I send you our deepest sympathy in your loss. His long record of distinguished service to our country and to the world is known to all and assure him an enduring fame, but to those of us who worked with him and came to know him intimately he will remain in memory, first as a loyal and lovable companion.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mrs. Tasker H. Bliss, 1842 Kalorama Road NW., Washington, D.C.]
