Good afternoon,
Your print pooler has checked in and been tested for COVID.
The only event on the President's public schedule today is his address tonight to a joint session of Congress.
A lunch/dinner lid until 7:30 PM.
The presidential motorcade departed from the South Lawn driveway at 8:30 p.m. ET, and we are rolling to the Capitol.
Pooler did not see POTUS depart the White House.
Motorcade came to a stop at the South side of the Capitol at 8:40 pm ET after rolling south on 17th St. NW before heading east on Independence Ave. SW.
Police had the streets for tonight's route blocked off to traffic. A handful of onlookers on foot, including apparent National Guard members in uniform, could be seen watching the motorcade pass. At least three Guard members saluted the motorcade as it passed.
Pooler did not see POTUS depart The Beast or enter the Capitol. We are holding in vans.
