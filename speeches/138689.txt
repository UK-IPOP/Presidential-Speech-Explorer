Extension of the Use of the National Guard to Respond to COVID-19 and to Facilitate Economic Recovery

. 
. It continues to be the policy of the United States to foster close cooperation and mutual assistance between the Federal Government and the States and territories in the battle against the threat posed by the spread of COVID-19, especially as the United States transitions to a period of increased economic activity and recovery in those areas of the Nation where the threat posed by COVID-19 has been sufficiently mitigated. To date, activated National Guard forces around the country have provided critical support to Governors as the Governors work to address the needs of those populations within their respective States and territories especially vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19, including those in nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and other long-term care or congregate settings. Additionally, States and territories will need assistance in fighting COVID-19 hot spots as they emerge. Therefore, to continue to provide maximum support to States and territories as they make decisions about the responses required to address local conditions in their respective jurisdictions with respect to combatting the threat posed by COVID-19 and, where appropriate, facilitating their economic recovery, I am taking the actions set forth in section 2 of this memorandum:

.
