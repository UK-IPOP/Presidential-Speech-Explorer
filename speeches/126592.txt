PYONGYANG, North Korea â€” Ohio Gov. John Kasich is calling on North Korea to immediately release a 21-year-old student from Cincinnati who was sentencedWednesday to 15 years of hard labor.
Otto Warmbier, a University of Virginia undergraduate, was convicted and sentenced for subversion in a one-hour trial in North Korea's Supreme Court. The sentencing took place weeks after authorities presented him to media and he tearfully confessed that he had tried to steal a propaganda banner.
Warmbier was charged with subversion under Article 60 of North Korea's criminal code. The court held that he had committed a crime "pursuant to the U.S. government's hostile policy toward (the North), in a bid to impair the unity of its people after entering it as a tourist."
