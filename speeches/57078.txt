The Administration has been actively involved in the development of a bipartisan package of benefits for activated reservists and active duty personnel now serving in America's armed forces. The bipartisan agreement embodied in the Mitchell-Dole amendment would authorize appropriations of roughly $500 million over 5 years to increase carefully selected benefits for American servicemen and women on a basis that is consistent with the Budget Enforcement Act.

If the Mitchell-Dole amendment is adopted, the Administration would support enactment of S. 578 — provided that it is not subsequently modified in a way that is unacceptable. This agreement is not limited to the authorization language contained in S. 578. The Administration is committed to working with the Appropriations Committees to fund the implementation of the bipartisan agreement in a manner consistent with the Budget Enforcement Act.

The major provisions contained in the Mitchell-Dole amendment are as follows:

— Defer the payments on federal guaranteed student loans;

— Exempt MIA's from $10,000 annual cap on the amount that can be contributed to the Department of Defense saving plan;

— Provide care for veterans who develop active psychosis within two years of discharge;

— Extend, by two years, the filing date for burial and funeral benefits;

— Increase G.I. Bill benefits for reservists in a pro-rated manner, based on their active duty service;

— Provide reservists who do not have health care insurance when discharged with one month transitional coverage from the Federal government.
