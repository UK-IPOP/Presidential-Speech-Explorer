Senator John F. Kennedy telephoned the following statement this afternoon from Hyannis Port, Mass to his Senate office, concerning the death last night of Leland Olds, former Chairman of the Federal Power Commission:

  In the death of Leland Olds, the nation has lost a dedicated and tireless public servant. Many of the great water and resource development projects were the result of negotiations and plans made by Mr. Olds. In a sense, these developments, such as the St. Lawrence Waterway and power projects, are a permanent memorial to him. He had the vision and the energy to establish the foundation for the giant power system which will soon be serving America. The Nation will miss Leland Olds.
