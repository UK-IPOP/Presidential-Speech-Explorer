 We answered enough questions today. The only reason I'm stopping: I feel badly you're here this hour of the night.
Mr. President, can you clarify what you said about no—that there's no—no one in the Democratic Party is antipolice?
 I didn't say that.
I know that you have said you don't want to defund the police——
 I said that that is not the Democratic Party's position.
Okay.
 I'm the Democratic Party; I am President. So is the Speaker of the House, and so is the majority leader. We are not the defunding the police.
Okay. And are there people who—in the Democratic Party, who want to defund the police?
 Mr. President——
 Are there people in the Republican Party who think we're sucking the blood out of kids?
. I'm not sure. Are there people in the Democratic Party who wanted to defund the police?
