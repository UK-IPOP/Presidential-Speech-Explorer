THE HOUSE has just passed the fiscal 1969 appropriation for the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
This measure is a step forward--but it does not go far enough.
The sums voted for our city programs are higher than the amounts approved by Congress last year. But they fall far short of the request the President made in the January budget for the important model cities and rent supplement programs so essential to ease the crisis in our cities.
I hope the Senate will fully restore the amounts to the minimum levels I recommended so that we can move forward with the urgent task of rebuilding the American city.
