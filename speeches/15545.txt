[ Released May 11, 1951 Dated May 10, 1951 ]
Dear Dr. Johnson:
I have read with interest the resolution adopted by the Board of Foreign Scholarships on April 7, 1951, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the members of the Board for their outstanding public service.
The program on which they have been working (created by Public Law 584, 79th Congress, and commonly known as the Fulbright Act) provides for the international exchange of students, professors, research scholars and teachers.
This program is vitally important in widening the knowledge and technical ability of the peoples of the twelve participating countries. Even more important, it is he/ping us all to understand each other better than ever before. And it is proving effective in combatting communist lies and distortions about social, economic and political conditions and objectives in our respective countries.
The Board of Foreign Scholarships, as well as the Department of State and the binational educational foundations and commissions overseas, is to be commended for the significant success already achieved and for the considerable prestige which is accruing to this program abroad.
I am pleased to accept the resolution of the Board of Foreign Scholarships, to approve the principles it embodies and to reaffirm my unqualified support for the purpose which this program represents.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Walter Johnson, Ph.D., Chairman, Board of Foreign Scholarships, 5625 Kenwood Avenue, Chicago 37, Illinois]
