In an exchange of diplomatic notes on July 6, the United States and the Russian Federation reached a common understanding on a framework for the U.S. â€“ Russia Joint Commission on Prisoners of War and Missing in Action (POW/MIAs). The Commission serves as a forum through which both nations seek to determine the fates of their missing servicemen.

This exchange restores in full the important work of the Joint Commission and demonstrates the unwavering commitment both our countries have toward our servicemen and women.

The U.S. side of the Joint Commission is chaired by General Robert H. "Doc" Foglesong, USAF (ret) U.S. Commission members include Senators Saxby Chambliss and John F. Kerry; Representative and former Vietnam War POW Sam Johnson; Amb. Charles Ray, DASD for POW/MIA Affairs; Mr. A. Denis Clift, President of the Joint Military Intelligence College; Dr. Timothy Nenninger of the National Archives; a Department of State Deputy Assistant Secretary, and Mr. Norman Kass, Department of Defense, who serves as the Executive Secretary.
