The Administration supports reauthorization of the ACTION agency's programs and has transmitted legislation to accomplish that objective. The Administration, however, opposes H.R. 4116 unless it is amended to:


— remove the proposed establishment of a VISTA Literacy Corps which is an unnecessary, duplicative new program;

— delete the statutory requirement for a specified minimum number of VISTA volunteers each year; and

— incorporate amendments proposed by the Administration.
