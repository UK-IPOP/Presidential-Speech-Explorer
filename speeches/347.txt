I herewith transmit a memorial* which I have received from the Choctaw tribe of Indians and citizens of the State of Mississippi, with a request that I should communicate the saint to Congress. This I do not feel myself at liberty to decline, inasmuch as I think that some action by Congress is called for by justice to the memorialists and in compliance with the plighted national faith.
JOHN TYLER.
