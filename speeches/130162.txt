"Texas produces more electricity than any other state, generating almost twice as much as Florida, the second highest-producing state." ("Texas,"

"In 2000, wind farms generated just 116 megawatts of capacity on the state's main electric grid. That number soared to more than 11,000 megawatts under Perry, with wind fuels about 10 percent of all generation. (On average, one megawatt-hour can power 260 typical Texas homes for an hour.)"

"Perry also backed a $7 billion electrical transmission project to connect windy, largely empty West Texas to growing cities demanding more power. Completed in 2013, the Competitive Renewable Energy Zone initiative stretches nearly 3,600 miles and can send up to 18,500 megawatts of power — including from non-wind sources — across the state."

"Air quality in Texas has significantly improved during a period when the Texas population increased over 25 percent: From 2000 to 2013, ozone levels in Texas decreased by 24 percent.  This reduction is 12 percent greater than the national average. Nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions dropped by nearly 63 percent from large stationary sources from 2000 to 2012. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from large stationary sources decreased over 50 percent between 2000 and 2012. 91 percent of benzene monitors operating from 2000 through 2012 have shown decreases, resulting in greater health protection against the possibility of blood cell or cancer (i.e. leukemia) effects for Texans across the state."
