 In February 2007, Governor Romney traveled to Dearborn, Michigan, and announced his candidacy for President of the United States with a call for conservative change in Washington. In the year since then, Governor Romney has laid out a bold agenda that will bring change to our nation's capital. As Governor Romney has campaigned across the country, his vision has been voted on and endorsed by Republicans and conservatives.

 Across America, there are thousands of families with members in the Armed Forces, Reserves and National Guard who need more support from Washington. To make America safer, Governor Romney will:
- 
- 
 This will help provide the resources needed for equipment, modernization, training and care for our wounded soldiers.
- 
 Governor Romney will bring together a team of private-sector and defense experts to carry out a stem-to-stern review of military purchasing.
- 
 The SPF will integrate all elements of national power under a new force with leadership drawn from our Army Special Forces trained to work with civilian governments and intelligence personnel to form a new capability to help defeat the Jihadists.
- 
 The Rapid Innovation Force will rapidly deploy the equipment and innovative solutions our troops need for their success and protection.
 America's strength is amplified when it is combined with the strength of other nations. We need to expand alliances such as NATO and efforts among the world's leading nations to face the new threat of radical Jihad and increase our homeland security. To make America safer, Governor Romney will:
- 
 As President, Governor Romney will call together our Middle East allies and the major nations of the developed world to establish a Partnership for Prosperity and Progress. This Partnership will assemble the resources of all developed nations to assure that threatened Islamic states have public schools, micro-credit and banking, the rule of law, human rights, basic health care, and competitive economic policies.
- 
 The Global Network will link intelligence and law enforcement capabilities around the world to share data about border crossings, biometric indicators, passport fraud, nuclear and biological threats, criminal patterns, human trafficking and drug trafficking.
 Today, protecting the homeland must begin far from home. Intelligence and law enforcement efforts able to address threats before they reach our shores must be a priority for U.S. and international action. To make America safer, Governor Romney will:
- 
 We need to eliminate duplicative efforts, revitalize recruitment and prioritize efforts in the field, expanding human intelligence.
- 
 The Patriot Act has given our men and women in the law enforcement and intelligence communities the tools they need to defend America.
- 
 Our most basic civil liberty is the right to be kept alive and Governor Romney will use every tool at our disposal to keep America safe.
 (Governor Mitt Romney, Remarks At Announcement, Dearborn, MI, 2/13/07)
 Washington is failing our veterans. Governor Romney believes we must do more to support our men and women in uniform, their families and those who have returned home after serving their country. To enhance care for our veterans and military families, Governor Romney will:
- 
 Governor Romney will call for a regular outside review of Montgomery G.I. Bill benefits to ensure that our veterans, active duty military, and their eligible spouses and dependents have the resources they need to pursue the opportunities they deserve.
- 
 Governor Romney will call on every state to extend in-state tuition benefits to military dependents whose parents are stationed there and, furthermore, to permit the continuation of the in-state tuition rate even if their parents are reassigned and forced to leave the state.

 Governor Romney will work to ensure that America's economy, businesses and workers have the tools they need to compete in this global economy. To grow the economy and keep our jobs, Governor Romney will:
- 
 Governor Romney will seek to bring together nations committed to open markets and playing by the rules in the largest ever Free Trade Area, and go beyond traditional trade to promote high standards in areas critical to U.S. competitiveness.
- 
 The Doha Round and free trade agreements can be huge opportunities for America.
- 
 Governor Romney's vision for expanding trade includes stronger enforcement efforts, multilateral efforts to stop currency manipulation, action against intellectual property rights theft, negotiations to open markets for services, and building food, safety and other standards to protect Americans.
- 
- 
 These self-managed accounts will give workers the opportunity to take control of their own futures by getting the training and education they need to succeed in the new economy.
- 
 Governor Romney will initiate an audit of all existing worker training and educational programs to ensure that workers are being helped most efficiently.
- 
 As President, Governor Romney will eliminate cumbersome and unnecessary regulations and bureaucracies that hinder economic growth.
- 
 As President, Governor Romney will emphasize math and science education, while promoting innovative approaches such as charter schools and public-private partnerships.
- 
 (Governor Mitt Romney, Remarks At Announcement, Dearborn, MI, 2/13/07)
 Lower taxes are the key to ensuring continued economic growth and job creation. However, our economy is threatened by looming tax hikes. To reduce taxes, Governor Romney will:
- 
 Making the Bush tax cuts permanent is the first step to ensuring that Americans are able to keep more of their hard-earned money.
- 
 As President, Governor Romney will cut marginal tax rates across the board, allowing all Americans to save more money.
- 
 Governor Romney's plan will allow middle class Americans to save tax free by changing the tax rate on interest, capital gains and dividends to absolutely 0%.
- 
 It is unfair to tax Americans three times: once when they earn their money; second when they invest it and receive income from those investments; and third when they die.
- 
 The United States has the second highest corporate tax rate in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. We cannot afford to have a tax rate that is out of alignment with the other major economies of the world.
- 
 We can strengthen Social Security without resorting to higher Social Security taxes that will impact all Americans. Governor Romney will oppose any proposed increase in Social Security taxes.
- 
 At the very least, Congress must pass a patch to the AMT that will prevent this tax from affecting more and more families in America.
 (Governor Mitt Romney, Remarks At Announcement, Dearborn, MI, 2/13/07)
 Americans are concerned about the overspending in Washington. Like the millions of families and businesses across the country, government should also live within a budget. To end Washington's spending binge, Governor Romney will:
- 
 He will veto any non-defense appropriations bill that grows spending at a rate greater than inflation minus one percent (CPI-1%). This will save $300 billion over 10 years.
- 
 Restoring this power to the President would allow us to make tremendous strides in eliminating earmarks and cutting inefficient programs.
- 
 Governor Romney's administration will undertake an exhaustive review of each individual federal program to eliminate and consolidate programs that are no longer useful or are bureaucratic and unwieldy.
- 
 The amount of money Congress tells the President to spend should be a spending ceiling, not a final price tag.
- 
 Making it even harder to attempt to increase taxes will help impose the fiscal discipline we need to stop overspending.
 (Governor Mitt Romney, Remarks At Announcement, Dearborn, MI, 2/13/07)
 Government in Washington has become duplicative, burdensome and inefficient. Our government is broken and can only be changed with someone from outside of Washington free of any special interest. To make government simpler and smaller, Governor Romney will:
- 
 Governor Romney's administration will undertake an exhaustive review of each individual federal program to eliminate and consolidate programs that are no longer useful or are bureaucratic and unwieldy.
 (Governor Mitt Romney, Remarks At Announcement, Dearborn, MI, 2/13/07)
 America's immigration system is broken, but for too long all our leaders in Washington have done is talk about ending illegal immigration. Governor Romney believes we must enforce and reform our immigration laws so that we can end illegal immigration. To end illegal immigration, Governor Romney will:
- 
 Governor Romney will follow through on the Congressional commitment to build a physical and technological fence along the southern border, and secure other points of entry throughout the country.
- 
 Governor Romney will issue a biometrically-enabled and tamper-proof card to non-citizens and create a national database so employers can easily verify the legal status of non-citizens in this country.
- 
 Governor Romney will make it easier for employers to verify legal status and work authorization of non-citizens through a federal database. Employers will be held accountable if they hire illegal immigrants with stiffer fines and penalties.
- 
 Governor Romney opposes amnesty or any special path to citizenship for those here illegally.
- 
 Governor Romney will cut back federal funding to cities that are "sanctuaries" for illegal immigrants.
- 
 Governor Romney opposes giving driver's licenses or in-state tuition to those here illegally. He believes states should not provide those types of incentives. As President, he will cut back federal funding to states that do so.
- 
 More state and local authorities should work with the federal government to enforce immigration laws.
- 
 Governor Romney will provide additional resources to enforce existing immigration laws throughout the nation.
- 
 Governor Romney believes we must teach English in our classrooms because to be successful you have to speak the language of America.
- 
 Governor Romney believes we should end the policy of chain migration that says if a child is born here to illegal immigrants then, by right, the entire family is brought in based upon that child's citizenship.
- 
 Governor Romney will streamline the visa system to recruit and retain skilled workers in high demand by U.S. companies. He will also welcome the best and the brightest from around the world to our universities.
 (Governor Mitt Romney, Remarks At Announcement, Dearborn, MI, 2/13/07)
 Energy costs that put pressure on household finances are a major concern for families. Yet, for too long, Washington insiders have talked about making America energy independent. To end our dependence on foreign oil, Governor Romney will:
- 
 Because energy independence is crucial to our economy and national security, Governor Romney will make it a top administration priority to become energy independent.
- 
 This investment will encourage the commercialization of alternative energy.
- 
 Governor Romney will pursue our domestic sources of energy, drawing from our broad and diverse base of options, including opening ANWR.
- 
 Governor Romney will shift federal priorities to emphasize issues of energy security, particularly at the Department of Energy.
- 
 Governor Romney will accelerate the construction of new nuclear power plants in order to ensure that nuclear power continues to be a part of a robust, cleaner and more reliable energy mix.
 (Governor Mitt Romney, Remarks At Announcement, Dearborn, MI, 2/13/07)
 Governor Romney has outlined a comprehensive solution to America's health care ills that expands access to affordable, portable, quality, private health insurance. For too long, too many have talked about reforming health care. To make health care more affordable, Governor Romney will:
- 
- 
- 
- 
 - 
 - 
 (Governor Mitt Romney, Remarks At Announcement, Dearborn, MI, 2/13/07)
 As President, Governor Romney will emphasize math and science education, while promoting innovative approaches such as charter schools and public-private partnerships. To ensure our education system prepares our children for a new generation of challenges, Governor Romney will:
- 
 He believes that when parents and kids are free to choose their school, everyone benefits. That's because competition and choice in educational opportunities – whether it comes from private schools, charter schools, or home schooling – makes traditional public schools better and improves the quality of education for all of America's kids.
- 
 As of 2003, there were nearly 1.1 million home schooled students in the United States. Governor Romney believes that parents who want to home school their kids should be able to do so. To help them, he will provide a tax credit to help defray the educational expenses of parents who home school their kids.
- 
 He believes that No Child Left Behind has played an important role in stressing the role of accountability and high standards in improving our schools. Governor Romney will improve NCLB by giving states that meet or exceed testing requirements additional flexibility in measuring student performance. He will also improve the law by focusing more attention on individual student progress, rather than the overall progress of schools.
- 
 Governor Romney believes that good teachers should be rewarded for their hard work and dedication to the important cause of educating our children. He will support performance-based pay and other initiatives that encourage our best teachers to teach in our highest-need schools.
- 
 Governor Romney will focus our efforts in fields like math and science, while promoting innovative approaches such as charter schools and public-private partnerships. He will ensure that the workers of the future have the intellectual capital and skills they need to compete in the new global marketplace.
- 
 While there is a proper role for the federal government to play in education, it is not in telling parents, teachers, kids and local authorities what to teach or how to run their schools.
 (Governor Mitt Romney, Remarks At Announcement, Dearborn, MI, 2/13/07)
 Far too often, the American people have been forced to put up with the ethical problems of our nation's representatives in Washington. Those we elect should live up to a higher standard. To bring a higher standard to Washington, Governor Romney will:
- 
 Any elected official or federal official who violates the public's trust should be stripped of the taxpayer funded pensions.
- 
 As President, one of Governor Romney's first acts will be to issue an Executive Order prohibiting the immediate family of an Cabinet or Senior Staff member from lobbying the Executive Branch.
 (Governor Mitt Romney, Remarks At Announcement, Dearborn, MI, 2/13/07)
 There is much our nation can do to assist and validate parents in their vital role because families are the building blocks of America. Our future as a nation is determined not just by heads of state but also by heads of households. To strengthen families, Governor Romney will:
- 
 As President, Governor Romney will act to strengthen the family, particularly in the inner cities of America. This White House Summit will be a springboard to develop new initiatives to strengthen families.
- 
 Today, a single mother with child care who marries the father of her child can lose as much as $6,000 a year in government benefits. Their combined incomes can disqualify them for Medicaid, housing vouchers, food stamps, and welfare. It is time to make fathers responsible for their child's health and care. Furthermore, we need to end the tax penalty on married couples.
- 
 In an effort to keep government from doing things that hurt and weaken families in America, President Ronald Reagan issued an Executive Order establishing a requirement that new government policies and programs be subject to the Family Impact Statement. However, this Executive Order was rescinded by President Clinton. As President, Governor Romney will reinstate the Family Impact Statement and initiate an audit of all current programs and policies which may negatively impact families.
- 
 In Massachusetts, Governor Romney fought to promote traditional marriage after the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court legalized same-sex marriage. Governor Romney believes marriage is primarily about the development and nurturing of children. Every child deserves a mother and a father. Governor Romney supports a federal amendment because it is the only way to truly protect marriage.
- 
 As President, Governor Romney will promote pro-life polices. He will oppose taxpayer-funded abortion, partial-birth abortion, abortion in military clinics and funding of abortion in international aid programs. He will work to ban embryonic cloning. He will work to increase adoptions by making the adoption tax credit permanent and raising awareness about embryonic adoption, or snowflake babies.
- 
 We must clean up the culture that surrounds our children. Computer pornography has given new meaning to the words "home invasion." As President, Governor Romney will work to ensure that every home computer has an easy to engage pornography filter so that parents can protect their children. Predators who use the Internet to sexually assault children will be subject to a new "One Strike, You're Ours" law of imposing long prison sentences followed by lifetime GPS tracking.
- 
 We can do a better job educating our kids on the perils of drug use. Parents may be the best anti-drug there is. A study last month showed that young children who come from homes where families had dinner together five times a week or more were 1/6th as likely to have used drugs.
- 
 As President, Governor Romney will ensure that his Attorney General defends the free exercise of religion. The United States is a nation under God and should remain that way.
 (Governor Mitt Romney, Remarks At Announcement, Dearborn, MI, 2/13/07)
 Governor Romney believes that Presidents have a solemn obligation to appoint women and men for judicial service who respect the rule of law and who will be faithful to the law as enacted. As President, he will nominate judges who respect the separation of powers, are committed to judicial restraint, and have a genuine appreciation of the text, structure, and history of our Constitution. The judges he nominates will recognize that as Justice Scalia once said, the Court ought not take the field as some kind of "junior-varsity Congress."
