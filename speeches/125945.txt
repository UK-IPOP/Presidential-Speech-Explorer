Former Congressman Sid Morrison will serve as Washington State Co-Chair for the campaign. 
Said Morrison, "As Governor Kasich's campaign moves to the Pacific Northwest, I look forward to sharing his message of results with voters. No other candidate comes close to matching John Kasich's record of solving problems and uniting people. No other Republican can defeat Hillary Clinton in November. I'm proud to join the Governor's talented team in my home state."
