There are multiple issues on which he's tried to do these sorts of things. For example, when the free trade agreement was up, he wrote an opinion piece in the 
, he wrote it with Paul Ryan. And just three days later, he flipped on it, after I don't know why â€” he got some pressure on the fast track authority. He's done it on votes on farm issues. In fact, changed his vote on the floor of the Senate.
So there is always some of that, because new facts are presented. But I think my concern is the voters: 
I think when you spend your whole time telling people you are a clear talker and you say what you mean, and everyone else is a sellout, but you're the only purist, I think it is fair to say hold on a second. Here is where you have been in the past on some issues, and here is where you are now. The truth is everyone running on the Republican side supports strong, conservative positions.
