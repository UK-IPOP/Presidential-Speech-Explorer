Today, Romney for President released a new web video titled "A Few More Of The 23 Million." Non-union Delphi employees were given less favorable benefits than union employees during the auto bailout and GM restructuring. Despite Vice President Joe Biden saying that "most did fine," they don't agree.
: 
 "As GM and Chrysler went through bankruptcy, employees of major auto supplier, Delphi, saw their pensions slashed. Vice President Joe Biden said 'most did fine.' They don't agree."
 "...MOST DID FINE" â€“ Vice President Joe Biden, May 16, 2012
 "Well I thought about this one job I had in my long career and I worked alongside an hourly appointed person and we managed the local joint training fund for the brake operations. And I got to be very good friends with this person. And we worked side-by-side for years. That person has their healthcare and that person has their pension."
 "I don't think the current administration looked upon us as favorable. I think they truly did pick winners and losers in the automotive bailout."
 "It is unjust. And when your government is making this choice and then using my own tax money to make this choice and declare me 'not deserving' I feel that they have disdain for us."
 "They funded the GM salary and the UAW pensions. They funded the IUE pensions. And they left the salary people just for mere fact we didn't have a union, we didn't have inner recourse."
 "What? Wait a minute... Is this still America?"
