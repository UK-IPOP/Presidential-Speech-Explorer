 "The bill Senator Feingold and I are introducing today is designed to put an end to the abusive, illegal practices of these 527s. I urge my colleagues to support swift passage of this bill and put an end to this problem once and for all." (Sen. John McCain, Press Release, 1/31/07)
 SEN. JOHN MCCAIN: "Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my good friend and colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold in once again introducing legislation to replace the Federal Election Commission (FEC) with the Federal Election Administration (FEA). The FEA would serve as an independent body to enforce federal campaign laws - something the FEC has been unable, and often unwilling, to do. This legislation would terminate the FEC and establish a new regulatory entity. Using a new organizational structure and administrative law judges, we hope to avoid the routine partisan deadlocks that are now so prevalent at the FEC. This bill would authorize the new FEA to impose civil penalties, issue cease and desist orders, report apparent criminal violations to the appropriate law enforcement authorities, and conduct audits and field examinations of campaign committees. Finally, Mr. President, this bill would direct the Comptroller General to examine and report to Congress on the enforcement of the criminal provisions of the federal campaign finance laws. I urge my colleagues to support this common sense reform proposal." (Sen. John McCain, Press Release, 2/1/07)
