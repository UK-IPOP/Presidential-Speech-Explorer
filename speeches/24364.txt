WHEN the food stamp program took its first experimental step in McDowell County, the Nation watched to see if this Federal-State-local effort could effectively help lowincome families share America's food abundance.
Today, with the enthusiasm and cooperation of State officials, welfare people, business interests, and the entire community of McDowell County, the food stamp program is helping well over 1 million people in some 300 areas throughout the country.
