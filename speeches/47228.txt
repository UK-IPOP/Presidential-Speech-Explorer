The Administration opposes H.R. 5520 mainly because:


(2) The bill authorizes a new State grant program that appears to require health, education, and social services to all handicapped infants (and their families) from birth through age two, in participating States. As drafted, the program could adversely affect the services currently provided to children and is not clearly targeted on the basis of family income. These proposed authorities deserve much more study than they have received to date.
The Administration is extremely concerned about the major Federal, State, and local cost implications of these new authorities. Programs under the Act do not require reauthorization until next year, and hasty enactment of these provisions would be unwise and unnecessary.
