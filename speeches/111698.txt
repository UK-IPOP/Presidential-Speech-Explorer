"Today's manufacturing report is just further evidence that President Obama doesn't have what it takes to get our economy moving again. After three and a half years of failed liberal policies, the President has left us with an economy where manufacturing is slowing and businesses aren't hiring. On Day One, Mitt Romney will take immediate action to give manufacturers and all businesses the confidence they need to hire again." â€” Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 "Growth in the U.S. manufacturing sector slowed in July to the second-weakest level since the country emerged from recession, according to a survey released Tuesday.
