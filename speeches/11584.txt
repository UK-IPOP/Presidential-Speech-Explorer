Yesterday we signed an agreement with the Danish Minister in Washington, who acts on behalf of the King of Denmark, as Sovereign of Greenland, including Greenland in our system of cooperative hemispheric defense.
This agreement was signed on the anniversary of the day on which German troops invaded Denmark.
Last May the Greenland Councils requested the United States to keep in mind the exposed position of the Danish flag in Greenland. I at once offered to make available relief, if necessary; and to assure a continued flow of necessary supplies for the island. The present step is a new proof of our continuing friendliness to Denmark. Under the present circumstances the Government in Denmark cannot, of course, act in respect of its territory in the Western Hemisphere, but we propose to make sure that when the German invasion of Denmark has ended, Greenland will remain a Danish colony. Meanwhile, we earnestly hope for the quick liberation of Denmark from her present invaders.
