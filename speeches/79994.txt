Civil aviation relations with Russia are governed by a bilateral Air Transport Agreement that entered into force on January 14, 1994. A Protocol signed on April 5, 1999 amended the Agreement to include six Annexes covering scheduled/charter air services, commercial opportunities, overflights, code-sharing and Alaska-Russian Far East air service; these Annexes expired on January 22, 2001. On April 11, 2002, agreement was reached to amend and extend these six Annexes to April 2004.
