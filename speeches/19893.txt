Dear Mr. Prime Minister:
It was most gratifying to read your letter of January nineteenth reaffirming that United States economic aid and technical assistance programs have helped to strengthen Thailand's economy and have facilitated the training of technicians needed in meeting your country's economic objectives.
I was also glad to hear of the arrival in the United States of the 1000th participant from Thailand in the technical training program conducted by our International Cooperation Administration.
The American people are happy to share their technical skills with the friendly people of Thailand. It gives us great satisfaction to know that a sizeable body of technicians who have benefited from training in the United States are now available to Thailand and are serving to advance the prosperity of their country and the well-being and happiness of their countrymen. We Americans in turn have learned much and profited very considerably from working with the people of Thailand, both in the United States and in your country. We have come to know better the deep and ancient culture of Thailand and to understand your national aspirations. I have every hope that the friendly cooperation which exists between our two countries and brings so many mutual benefits will be long continued.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
