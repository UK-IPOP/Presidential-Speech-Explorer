BALTIMORE, MDâ€”Today, Governor Martin O'Malley released the following statement in support of those rallying today outside of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals:
"Today, in solidarity with the thousands of New Americans rallying outside of the New Orleans district court where oral arguments on DACA + and DAPA will begin, Governor O'Malley offered the following poem by Eavan Boland, which he read in Iowa on the 4th of July:

The Emigrant Irish
Like oil lamps we put them out the back,

of our houses, of our minds. We had lights better than,

newer than and then a time came,

this time and now we need them.

Their dread, makeshift example.
They would have thrived on our necessities.

What they survived we could not even live.

By their lights now it is time to

imagine how they stood there, what they stood

with, that their possessions may become our power.
Cardboard. Iron. Their hardships parcelled in them.

Patience. Fortitude. Long-suffering

in the bruise-coloured dusk of the New World.

And all the old songs. And nothing to lose.
