William F. McCombs, Democratic National Committee, New York:
I deeply appreciate your telegram and wish to extend to you and the members of the Campaign Committee my warm congratulations on the part you have played in the organization and conduct of a campaign fought out upon essential issues. A great cause has triumphed. Every Democrat, every true progressive of whatever alliance, must now lend his full force and enthusiasm to the fulfillment of the people's hopes, the establishment of the people's rights, so that justice and progress may go hand in hand.
WOODROW WILSON
