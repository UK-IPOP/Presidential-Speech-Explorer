I HAVE called a Midcentury White House Conference on Children and Youth and have appointed a committee of distinguished citizens to give general direction to the undertaking, under the Chairmanship of Honorable Oscar R. Ewing, Federal Security Administrator.
The value of this conference will depend upon full participation of each state. Mr. Ewing will communicate to you a suggestion that either you designate an existing body broadly representative in your state, or appoint a state committee to serve for this conference. I shall personally appreciate your cooperation in making the conference an outstanding contribution to child life in America.
