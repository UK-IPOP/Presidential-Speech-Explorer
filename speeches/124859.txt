This morning, the Marco Rubio for President campaign announced county leaders for Southwest Iowa helping Marco share his vision for a New American Century.

Marco is prepared to compete in all of Iowa's 99 counties, and today's announcement of county leaders continues to build on the strong organization that will help Marco succeed at the caucuses on February 1.

"Marco Rubio is the candidate best prepared to lead America in dangerous times," said Fremont County Attorney Corey Becker. "Southwest Iowa wants a president who will rebuild our military, defeat ISIS, and keep Americans safe. Marco has the most experience and the best judgment on these issues and that's why he is the right choice for president."

"I'm for Marco Rubio for president because he is a next generation leader who will reverse the damage Barack Obama has done to our free enterprise system," said Naomi Leinen of Pottawattamie County. "Marco's plan will modernize our economy to address the challenges of the 21st century and allow more Iowans than ever before to achieve the American dream."
