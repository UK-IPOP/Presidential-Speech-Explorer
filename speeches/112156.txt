"It's been two years since President Obama visited Carnegie Mellon University and promised that the economy 'is getting stronger by the day.' But after 41 straight months of unemployment above 8% and widespread weakening across our economy, it is more clear than ever that President Obama's policies are holding us back from a real recovery. On Day One, Mitt Romney will implement a bold, pro-growth agenda to jumpstart our economy, spark job creation, and finally get Americans back to work." â€”Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 OBAMA: "So despite temporary setbacks, uncertain world events, and the resulting up and downs of the market, this economy is getting stronger by the day. ...

 "Applications for unemployment benefits stayed above a level last week that is generally considered too high to lower the unemployment rate. And the annual growth rate for the U.S. economy in the January-March quarter was unchanged at a tepid 1.9 percent. ... Growth of around 1.9 percent typically generates roughly 90,000 jobs a month. That's considered too weak to lower the unemployment rate, which was 8.2 percent last month." (Christopher S. Rugaber, "Tepid Economic Growth Weighs On US Job Market,"
