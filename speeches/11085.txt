I AM profoundly shocked and distressed by the tragic accident to the R-101 and its dreadful toll of lives. May I express to Your Majesty, to the relatives of those who were lost, and to the people of Great Britain, the deep sympathy and grief of Mrs. Hoover and myself.
HERBERT HOOVER
[His Majesty George V, King of Great Britain, London]
