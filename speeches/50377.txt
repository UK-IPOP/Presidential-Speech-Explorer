The President has asked General John W. Vessey, Jr., USA, Ret., to continue in his role as Special Presidential Emissary to Hanoi for POW/MIA Affairs. General Vessey has served in this capacity since being named to the position by President Reagan in February 1987.
Beginning with his initial visit to Hanoi in August 1987, General Vessey's efforts have resulted in substantial progress in resolving this pressing humanitarian issue and ending the uncertainty for the families of our missing in Southeast Asia. The President is pleased that General Vessey has agreed to continue to serve his country in this position of great importance to all of us.
