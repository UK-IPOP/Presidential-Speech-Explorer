I have the honor to transmit herewith for the consideration of Congress, an estimate of appropriation for the Treasury Department for $500,000,000, for the fiscal year 1932 and to remain available until expended, for subscriptions to Capital Stock, Reconstruction Finance Corporation.
I am transmitting this estimate of appropriation at this time so that the important operations of the corporation may be commenced at the earliest possible date.
Further details regarding this estimate are set forth in the letter of the Director of the Bureau of the Budget, which is transmitted herewith.
Respectfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
