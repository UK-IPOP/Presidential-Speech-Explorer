Little Rock, AR – Former AR Governor and Presidential Candidate Mike Huckabee said today that a new CNN/Opinion Dynamics Poll shows that his GOP presidential campaign is the only one with "significant upward momentum."
Huckabee is now in a virtual dead heat with former Gov. Mitt Romney for third place, with 10 percent of the vote. The former Arkansas governor's polling numbers have doubled since a similar survey was taken on October 12-14. He is the only candidate experiencing a significant upward trend.
"This poll confirms what we're feeling on the ground: that my message is really connecting with voters. We're on a surge, moving up five points in the past two weeks, while others have reached their peak," said Huckabee.
"I keep telling my staff and supporters – we need to keep doing what we're doing. With only two months to go before the Iowa caucus, we need to keep pressing forward," said Huckabee.
The telephone survey of 1,024 registered Republican voters was conducted Nov. 2- 4, 2007 by the Opinion Research Corporation. There was a plus or minus margin of error of 1-3 percentage points.
