The Administration opposes the enactment of S. 1324 unless the provision to establish a statutory Inspector General (IG) at CIA is deleted.

The establishment of a statutory IG is unnecessary and could undermine the effective inspection and investigation process now in place at the CIA. An independent IG may create the impression that the Director of Central Intelligence will be unable to protect intelligence sources and methods, thereby affecting adversely the willingness of human sources and foreign liaison services to cooperate with the CIA. In addition, other IG-related provisions would interfere unconstitutionally with the President's ability to discharge his constitutional responsibility to appoint and remove officials.

The Administration also has reservations about the following provisions in S. 1324 and urges their deletion:

The Administration will also seek to have certain program authorization levels reallocated to make them consistent with the Administration's request. Specifically, the Administration urges that enhancements for arms control verification be authorized as requested.
