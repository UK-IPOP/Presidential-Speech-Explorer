The Administration supports H.R. 3392.



H.R. 3392 would affect receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is that the PAYGO effect is zero. Final scoring of this legislation may differ from this estimate.
