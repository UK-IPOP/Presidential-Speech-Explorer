Gov. Perry: "When you run for president, you get a bunch of questions about your faith."
"People want to know what drives you, how you make decisions."
"Now some liberals say that faith is a sign of weakness. Well they're wrong. I think we all need God's help."
"America's greatest leaders have been people of strong faith, strong values. That makes for a strong America."
"I'm Rick Perry, I'm not ashamed to talk about my faith, and I approve this message."
