[Released July 17, 1958. Dated July 16, 1958]
I have received with deep appreciation your message of July 15 concerning the affirmative response of the United States to the plea for assistance from the Government of Lebanon. I am profoundly gratified by your support for this action, taken in accordance with the principle of the United Nations Charter which recognizes as inherent the right of all nations to work together and to seek help when necessary to preserve their independence.
