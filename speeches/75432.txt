 Mr. President, any reaction to the earthquake news?
 I talked to the FEMA Director. He is on top of it. He is gathering all the information. He is in touch with the officials in the State of Washington. I think the Governor is on an airplane now, but as soon as he lands, we'll be in touch. Then we will assess whatever damage, and we will provide whatever resources are necessary to help the people.
 When were you told?
 I was told in Omaha.
 Do you have a message for the people of Washington?
 Well, God bless, obviously. Anything we can do to help, we will do so.
 Can you talk about your contingency plan as part of your budget outline and how this——
 Well, we've got money set aside for emergencies such as these.
