We want to express our appreciation to the thousands of volunteer workers all over America—Republicans, independents, Democrats—who joined in the crusade which has elected Dwight Eisenhower President of the United States.
The result of this election is a great tribute to the faith and the confidence that the American people have in his leadership and the natural gratification that we have at this moment. I think it is essential for us to recognize the tremendous responsibility that a new administration must assume in the critical period ahead.
As Dwight Eisenhower has said on occasion after occasion: there is nothing that 160,000,000 united Americans can't do. And I am confident that now that the election is over that we all join together behind his leadership in a program which will advance the cause of freedom and bring peace throughout the world.
