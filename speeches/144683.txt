Good morning from your pooler!
I will be in touch with any updates from the White House. There are no public events on President Biden's schedule today, but here is a rundown of the briefing schedule:
10:15 AM Press Briefing by White House COVID-19 Response Team and public health officials
1:00 PM Press Briefing by Press Secretary Jen Psaki, Deputy Director of the National Economic Council Sameera Fazili, and Senior Director for International Economics and Competitiveness Peter Harrell
More to come and as always, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
We have a lunch lid until 1 p.m., which as a reminder is when the briefing is scheduled to begin.
Two minutes, folks... prepare your devices.
A travel/photo lid has been called at 3:00 p.m.
Have a great rest of your day and safe travels to all those who are headed overseas!
