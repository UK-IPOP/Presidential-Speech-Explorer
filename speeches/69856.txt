Enactment of comprehensive legislation to address youth and gang violence and drug use is a top Administration priority. Accordingly, on February 25, 1997, the Department of Justice transmitted to Congress the Anti-gang and Youth Violence Act of 1997, which was introduced as H.R. 810 by Representative Schumer.
