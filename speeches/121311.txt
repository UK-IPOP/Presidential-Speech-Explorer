"U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham is in Iowa for a two day visit, and says, he wants an opportunity to meet as many voters as he can. The Republican spoke to a group of about 70 people at Music Man Square in Mason City on Wednesday evening. He answered questions ranging from issues of how to beat ISIS in Iraq and Syria, tensions between Israel and Iran, immigration, young people, and infrastructure improvements."

"He discussed his pro-life stance with supporters, and his opposition to the Nuclear talks with Iran. The senator told ABC9 news if he were President he would not have engaged in talks with the Iranian government, saying that he doesn't believe they can be trusted and the issue could lead to an arms race in the region. He also spoke candidly about his stance on tackling ISIL." (Deborah Souverain, "GOP Presidential Hopefuls Graham and Jindal Hold Grassroots Campaign Through Siouxland",

"Republican presidential candidate Lindsey Graham on Wednesday said he's a "practical kind of guy" who could 'connect' with voters who've been turned off by the GOP.
