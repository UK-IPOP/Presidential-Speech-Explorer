Obama voted twice in favor of the Democrats' FY 2009 budget resolution.

"Under both Democratic plans, tax rates would increase by 3 percentage points for each of the 25 percent, 28 percent and 33 percent brackets. At present, the 25 percent bracket begins at $31,850 for individuals and $63,700 for married couples. The 35 percent bracket on incomes over $349,700 would jump to 39.6 percent."
(Andrew Taylor, "Presidential Hopefuls To Vote On Budget," The Associated Press, 3/13/08)
Obama voted at least 94 times for higher taxes in the U.S. Senate. To date, Obama has voted for a tax increase approximately once every five days Congress has been in session.

Obama said he would have preferred a gradual increase in gas prices.
Obama: "Well, I think that we have been slow to move in a better direction when it comes to energy usage. And the president, frankly, hasn't had an energy policy. And as a consequence, we've been consuming energy as if it's infinite. We now know that our demand is badly outstripping supply with China and India growing as rapidly as they are. So..." CNBC's John Hardwood: "So could these high prices help us?" Obama: "I think that I would have preferred a gradual adjustment. The fact that this is such a shock to American pocketbooks is not a good thing."
