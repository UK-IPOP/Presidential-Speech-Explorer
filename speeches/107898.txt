Mitt Romney today announced the support of Iowa leaders including 2 former Speakers of the House, 5 current and former state senators, and 7 current and former state representatives.
"I am proud to earn the support of so many Iowa leaders," said Mitt Romney. "It is clear they share with me a vision of a "Smaller, Simpler, and Smarter" federal government. Their help will be necessary to spread my message of conservative economic principles to voters both in the Hawkeye state and the rest of the country."
Announcing his support, former State Senator and Ambassador to Latvia Chuck Larson said, "Governor Romney spent his life as a conservative businessman and has the values, integrity, and stability to lead our country."
