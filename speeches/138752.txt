 JOE BIDEN: "Surplus military equipment for law enforcement. They don't need that. The last thing you need is an up-armored Humvee coming into a neighborhood just like the military invading.

Co-Founder Melina Abdullah spoke with AirTalk's Larry Mantle about the organization's policy goals … Here's what she had to say: So it's important that as we say "defund the police," we understand that it's coupled with a reimagining of public safety. So if listeners are to think about why they or why their neighbors might call the police, we can say that the vast majority of the time, we're not looking for a police response. Most calls -- and the police admit this-- are issues like the neighbors playing the music too loud. Or there's someone who might be having a mental health issue."

AFTER WEEKS of sustained anger and activism following the police killings of several black Americans, one of the most contentious demands of the movement — to "defund the police" — is making waves in city councils across the country as advocates and elected officials clash over the most effective immediate responses to address police brutality and structural racism. Underlying these debates remains a higher-order question, one that was never going to be resolved in a single round of budget negotiations: How to reimagine public safety in America?"

 "'Defund the police,' if an imprecise slogan, has provided a North Star for a grassroots movement unlike any to convulse the country in almost half a century.

"Far too often, the law has shielded police officers who stand accused of heinous violations of civil and human rights. Democrats support lowering the intent standard for federally prosecuting law enforcement officials for civil rights violations.

 "As a former Sheriff, law enforcement officer for over 22 years, and now Governor, when it comes to supporting law enforcement officers and their families who are under attack, I'll always stand with President Trump and have their backs. Republicans and President Trump are working hard to take violent criminals off of our streets and stop these crazy efforts to defund the police. Joe Biden and the Democrats are allowing the radical left to make our communities less safe."
"Joe Biden won't stand up and stop the 'defund the police' movement being pushed by the most liberal elements in society. As Democrat leadership in cities across the nation allow their communities to burn and violence erupts, President Trump stands at the ready to continue defending our heroes as they preserve and protect our citizens."
 "Week after week Joe Biden cowers in his basement lending his silence to the radical left wing mob as they destroy our streets and viciously attack our law enforcement officers. While Biden has opened the doors of his campaign to a disgusting defund the police narrative, President Trump stands shoulder to shoulder with the men and women in blue."
 "Joe Biden has caved to left-wing extremists by vocally advocating for 'redirecting' funds away from police officers, which is synonymous with 'defunding' police: in fact, Joe Biden recently said we 'absolutely' need to redirect police funding, and police departments have 'become the enemy' in our communities. Police are not the enemy. Joe Biden has surrounded himself with radical advisors who are committed to defunding the police, using those exact terms like 'redirecting funds,' and no matter what he says, Joe Biden will fall in line with the radical left's defund-police insanity. Police officers saved my life. I've seen the best of what the men and women in uniform have to offer in America. If Joe Biden were president, our police departments simply wouldn't have the tools they need to protect our communities and keep us safe. President Trump supports the police officers who keep us safe, Joe Biden doesn't. It's that simple."
 "The idea that we should 'defund the police' is pure insanity. The vast, vast majority of law enforcement office are responsible, hardworking, and heroic first responders. Joe Biden and his liberal allies, like AOC, will no doubt give into the left-wing mob's demands and turn their backs against our brave police officers."
"Just when we thought a Biden Presidency couldn't be more dangerous, he has appeased the calls from the radical left to defund the police. It is despicable that he has branded the men and women who put their lives on the line to protect our communities as "the enemy". Call it "reimagining", "defunding", or "disbanding" the Democrats will stop at nothing to pit our heroes in law enforcement against the mob. It's terrifying and at any other time in history it would be considered insane. But not in today's Democratic Party."
"The Joe Biden-Bernie Sanders Socialist Unity plan will make our nation's communities dramatically more dangerous. Joe Biden's supporters have radical plans for America including defunding police departments, suing police officers out of existence, and releasing violent offenders back on the street without bail. These dangerous, socialist policies threaten the safety and security of law-abiding citizens and their families. As liberal Democrat cities defund police departments and violent mobs attack law enforcement officers and wreck our communities, Joe Biden's silence speaks volumes about what America should expect if he were elected president."
 "As a 23-year police officer, I am proud to be championing criminal justice reform that provides our police departments with the resources they need to keep our communities safe. Our country can't afford Joe Biden, who currently stands with Democrats demanding to defund and abolish our police departments and allow anarchy, looting, and rioting to rule our city streets."
 "As the former U.S. Attorney for West Tennessee, I had the privilege of working closely alongside our law enforcement. They risk their lives everyday to keep our communities and families safe. Former Vice President Biden's support of defunding our nation's police is irresponsible and could jeopardize the safety of our loved ones."
 "Joe Biden's plan to redirect funds from the police will harm not only all crime victims but also all Americans who rely on law enforcement to keep us safe. Each day our police perform countless acts of protecting and saving our children that we rarely hear about. Yesterday in New Jersey three officers saved an infant who could not breathe. Under the left wing agenda, those officers would not have been employed. President Trump stands with the men and women of law enforcement who protect our communities unlike Joe Biden who has given in to the radical left's demands of the defund the police moment."
 "Joe Biden and the Democrat Party are on a mission to spread hate and disrespect toward law enforcement officers in an effort to drive their radical agenda of diminishing the police force in our communities. As the Law and Order President, President Trump stands with law enforcement as they risk their lives to protect the American people and strongly supports the prosecution of the violent rioters attacking police officers in the streets."
 "For the eight years of the Obama/Biden presidency, I saw a steady decline in the respect for police officers and the job we did. Immediately upon President Trump becoming a candidate, he adamantly supported law enforcement officers and the job we did. Sadly, now, Joe Biden is once again playing to those unhappy with the job being done and even promoting the concept of defunding the police!! What Biden and the liberal Democrat party are doing is playing a game with our public safety!! We cannot allow for our police to be taken off the streets!"
