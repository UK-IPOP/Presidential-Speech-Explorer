"President Obama continues to talk out of both sides of his mouth. While lamenting negative ads and calling for a debate on the issues, his campaign is running a dishonest, shameful smear campaign with no plans to get Americans back to work. The American people deserve the truth and they certainly deserve better from their president." â€”Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
