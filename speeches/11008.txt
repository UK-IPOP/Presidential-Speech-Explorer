[Released May 1, 1931. Dated April 29, 1931]
I MOST CORDIALLY congratulate you and your associates upon the completion of the Empire State Building and the opening of its doors to the service of the public. This achievement justifies pride of accomplishment in everyone who has had any part in its conception and construction and it must long remain one of the outstanding glories of a great city.
HERBERT HOOVER
