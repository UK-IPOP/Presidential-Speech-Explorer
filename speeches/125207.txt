I'm proud to stand with Marco — he will be an outstanding commander-in-chief. As a member of the House Intelligence Committee and a veteran, there is no doubt that Marco has shown great national security leadership in the Senate.  The claims by Jeb Bush's Super PAC are misleading and reflect a deep misunderstanding of Marco's critically important record working to keep Americans safe. This is a great reminder of why I support Marco Rubio.  He is the one conservative candidate looking toward the future and having consistently demonstrated effective leadership on these most important issues.
As a member of the House Intelligence Committee and a former Air Force pilot, I'm proud to support Marco who understands more than any other candidate the threats facing our country, knows how we can defeat ISIS, and is ready to be commander-in-chief. It's disappointing that Jeb Bush's Super PAC decided to discard clear facts for political gain. Jeb Bush is better than the Los Angeles-based Super PAC trying to deceive voters.
