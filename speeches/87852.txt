"The President's plan makes clear that U.S. forces will be sent to Baghdad to help Iraqis clear and secure neighborhoods. That means combat operations, including possibly door-to-door sweeps. The Study Group made the assessment that the security of Baghdad is crucial to security in Iraq more generally and while we were in Baghdad at the end of the summer, Iraqi and American leaders told us that as Baghdad goes, so goes Iraq. … The Study Group … did state that it could support a short-term redeployment or surge of American combat forces to stabilize Baghdad or to speed up the training and equipping mission, if the United States commander in Iraq [said] that such steps would be effective."
 "… [T]he leaders of the Iraq Study Group … disputed the White House's contention that most of their recommendations had been incorporated into Mr. Bush's troop increase plan."
