[Released September 11, 1930. Dated September 10, 1930]
I SEND my cordial greetings to the Golden Jubilee Session of the National Baptist Convention of America and I do pray that they may be blessed in their deliberations and fruitful in their plans for yet more service to the ideals they have so happily forwarded and that are so profoundly important to the wall-being of mankind.
