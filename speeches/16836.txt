Dear Bob:
Your ability and wide experience, upon which the Government has relied extensively in the past, can again play an important role in the development of a vital program.
I am, therefore, naming you Vice Chairman of the President's Committee on National Employ the Handicapped Week.
In so doing, I know that the good service you will render in helping disabled veterans and other handicapped workers in finding useful jobs will prove of lasting benefit both to the Government and to them.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Honorable Robert Ramspeck, Executive Vice President, Air Transport Association of America, 1107 16th Street, Northwest, Washington, D.C.]
