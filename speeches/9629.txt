My dear Mr. Abelman:
The maintenance of the service of our hospitals is an imperative need, and I am glad to bespeak the generosity of all people of good-will in support of these institutions which minister so unselfishly to suffering humanity.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Max Abelman, 408 St. Johns Place, Brooklyn, N.Y.]
