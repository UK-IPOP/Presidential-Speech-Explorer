"Democrats are at it again. They want to fatten the upcoming Federal budget by $22 billion, saying it will have 'virtually no difference on the deficit.' No difference except $205 billion in additional spending over the next five years. No difference except the largest tax increase in history. No difference other than taking more of your earnings, so you'll have to work longer to pay the bills. The President won't stand for that. He'll veto any bill that doesn't hold the line on spending and achieve his goal of balancing the budget in the next five years."
