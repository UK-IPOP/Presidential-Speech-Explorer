Your Excellency, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen:

This morning America welcomes a friend:

--a patriot who has brought his country into independence,

--a leader who has given North Africa and the Mediterranean a vivid example of what modern men can achieve in an ancient land,

--a statesman who has worked for just peace throughout his region and in the world at large.
You have come, Mr. President, to a land that deeply admires what you and your people have accomplished in 12 years of nationhood.
America's friendship with Tunisia demonstrates that a nation of great size and power can play a role in the development of a smaller nation--without in any way detracting from its liberty of choice or its independence of action.
The United States neither has nor desires political dominion in North Africa and the Middle East. What we seek is what the war-weary people of the Middle East most desire themselves, that is, the hope of a better life and justice and peace.
Last June I reconfirmed our commitment to these goals in the Middle East. I committed us to pursue a peace based on five principles:

--first, the recognized right of national life;
--second, justice for the refugees;

--third, innocent maritime passage;

--fourth, limits on the wasteful and destructive arms race; and

--fifth, political independence and territorial integrity for all.
I restate these principles today. Many debates and many discussions have taken place since last June 19th. The United Nations Security Council passed its important resolution on November 22d. Our commitment to those principles--and to that resolution--has not changed. It will not change.
America respects and supports the aspirations of people who are new to independence, who work to preserve and to strengthen their freedom. It is a particular pleasure to welcome the great leader of such a nation as this, this morning.
Mr. President, we are pleased and proud to have you in America.
