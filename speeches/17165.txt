Dear Mr. Prime Minister:
I know that you will be personally interested in the arrangements I have made for the use of the generous gift from the people and Government of the Union of Burma which you entrusted to me during your recent visit.
As you requested, the money will be used for the benefit of the children of those members of the United States armed forces who lost their lives or were incapacitated in the Burma campaign. To that end, I have directed that the fund be assigned in three equal portions to the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and AMVETS. Each of these three prominent veterans organizations has been carrying on worthy programs of assistance to the children of veterans of the armed services of the United States. Each of them, under the terms of its charter, will be able to establish a separate fund to achieve the purpose you indicated. The gift of the Union of Burma will thus strengthen and help to perpetuate the beneficial activities of those organizations.
I wish again to express my appreciation and that of the people of the United States for this heart-warming expression of the close friendship and community of interests that exist between our two countries.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
