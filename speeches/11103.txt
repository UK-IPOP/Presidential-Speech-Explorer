My dear Mr. Ottinger:
I extend to you my best wishes for the success of your effort to raise $1,000,000 in New York City for the aid of suffering Jewry in Eastern and Central Europe.
The work of the Joint Distribution Committee is well known to me and I consider it a remarkable piece of human engineering.
A people who have for a period of over fifteen years provided funds for the rehabilitation of their unfortunate co-religionists in foreign lands, will, I feel sure, continue to work in this noble purpose and will contribute again so that the program affording opportunities of self-help and relief for these people on the other side may be carried on.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
