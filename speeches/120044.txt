Rubio is just hitting home runs all night. Really surprised how little time Cruz has gotten.

incoming from conservative activists so far: 
 
 getting ++ reviews. 
 better this time. 
 — John King (@JohnKingCNN) 
Marco Rubio is not a showman, so he doesn't speak much. But when he does, he has not stumbled at all tonight.

For the second half of the debate, could any of the others touch 
 in terms of substance, fluency, passion? Bravo, Marco! — Michael Medved (@MedvedSHOW) 


Rubio is crushing it. And he's right: Ask Trump detailed foreign policy questions as his new best friend Hugh did.

— Jon Ralston (@RalstonReports) 
On foreign policy, it's Rubio's show. No surprise there, but there's no one on that stage that comes close.

I keep waiting for Rubio to screw up. I am still waiting....

— Stuart Rothenberg (@StuPolitics) 
That was about 20 minutes before the end of the debate. Don't worry — Stu's still waiting.
