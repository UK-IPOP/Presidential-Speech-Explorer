ARLINGTON, VA -- McCain-Palin 2008 today announced that numerous retired senior enlisted leaders have endorsed John McCain for president. Endorsing John McCain, they issued the following joint statement:
We have had the honor and privilege of serving as career enlisted members of the United States Armed Forces. As senior enlisted leaders, we served in the trenches with so many of the fine young men and women who form the backbone of America's Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard. Our combined and individual experience informs our judgment that John McCain is the presidential candidate best suited to serve as America's commander-in-chief from his first day in office..
We believe that our National Security is at stake in the years ahead and in this election it is critical that we get it right. John McCain has been through the crucible. He is a man of courage and honor who we can count on to always put country first. He has the experience and demonstrated judgment to lead in troubled times. His entire life has been devoted to the service of America.
We unequivocally endorse him to continue his service to the country as the next President of the United States.
