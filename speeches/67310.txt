 Mr. President, what did you think of Dole's speech last night?
 I didn't watch it. I haven't watched any of it.
 How come?
 Because I've been on vacation. I want to let them have their convention. I'm looking forward to ours.
 Are you enjoying your stay here?
 Oh, I'm having a wonderful time, thank you.
 I was the ranger with Chelsea yesterday.
She's a good climber.
 Were you there with her?
 Yes.
 She loved it. You know, she loves that so much.
 She looked pretty good.
 She loves to do it. And I think she'd really like to take some more training. She spent 30 days out here in the West last summer, and she did some climbing. She was in the mountains; she was in valleys and rivers; she did a lot of work. I think she'd like to get pretty serious about this climbing business. She's strong, and she's flexible.
 Her mother might not be that interested.
 She's strong, and she's flexible and—what?
 Her mother might not be that interested.
 Yes, but she's a pretty prudent person. She's pretty safe. But I think if you're strong and flexible and have good balance—all that ballet training prepared her.
 Yes.
 Well, thanks for saying that.
 Mr. President, since you didn't see the speech would you like us to tell you about it? [

 I have an idea that you would edit in a way designed to elicit a response. And I wouldn't want to see it in the paper the next day. [

 There's a risk of that.
 Come on, we can afford to have 2 more days of enjoyment, then we can go back and deal with all that. [
