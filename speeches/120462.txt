 — Ted Cruz knows that a strong America makes the world a safer place. As President, Cruz will restore American leadership in the world, find and kill radical Islamic terrorists like ISIS, stand up to international bullies Iran and Russia, and repair relations with Israel.
Sen. Cruz said, "What we need is a Commander in Chief that makes it clear if you join ISIS then you are signing your death warrant."
