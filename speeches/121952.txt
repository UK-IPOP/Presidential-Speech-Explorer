Hillary has always stood with Planned Parenthood—and always will.
This week, following a horrific attack on a clinic in Colorado Springs, the Senate voted to defund Planned Parenthood. Today, Planned Parenthood is coming together in a national day of solidarity, to remember the victims of the attack and take a stand against efforts to limit women's access to affordable and safe health care. Hillary is proud to stand with them—today, and every day.

  " They want to deprive millions of women from getting cancer screenings, finding out whether they have HIV, getting help on family planning and contraceptives. It is a mean-spirited, partisan attack on an organization that has been there for women, often the only place that young women, lower-income women, have been able to go and get treated with respect and get the kind of health care they deserve."

  " I would hope that the Republicans ... would not put our country and our economy in peril pursuing some kind of emotionally, politically charged, partisan attack on Planned Parenthood to shut our government down."

  " This really isn't complicated. When you attack Planned Parenthood, you attack women's health, and when you attack women's health, you attack America's health."
