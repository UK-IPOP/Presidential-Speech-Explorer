My dear Mrs. Palmer:
I am grieved to learn of the death of your distinguished father, Congressman Charles M. Stedman of North Carolina. He will be gratefully remembered for his high character and for his long and useful public service. I send you my deepest sympathy in your loss.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mrs. Katharine Palmer, George Washington Inn, Washington, D.C.]
