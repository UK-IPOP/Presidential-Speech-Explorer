My dear Mr. Barton:
I am profoundly grieved to learn of the death of your father, and Mrs. Hoover and I wish you to know our deep sympathy with you in your loss. The Nation will long cherish the memory of his outstanding contributions to religion and literature and his splendid idealism in service of our country.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Bruce Barton, 383 Madison Avenue, New York, N.Y.]
