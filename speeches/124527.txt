UNDERWOOD, Iowa â€“ In a new poll, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders is pulling away from Hillary Clinton in the homestretch to the Granite State's first-in-the-nation primary on Feb. 9.
Sanders lead over Clinton is now 60 percent to 33 percent, CNN and WMUR-TV in Manchester, New Hampshire reported.
"This poll suggests that our campaign has real momentum and that the American people want to go beyond establishment politics and establishment economics. But it's just a poll and we take nothing for granted," said Jeff Weaver, Sanders' national campaign manager.
"During the next three weeks in New Hampshire we will be contacting tens of thousands of people and do all that we can to see a large voter turnout on Election Day," added Julia Barnes, the director of Sanders' campaign in New Hampshire.
Support for Sanders continues to grow as more people hear his plans to fix our broken economy and take on the corrupt campaign finance system that holds it in place," campaign manager Jeff Weaver said. "Our campaign is focused every day on organizing to harness that energy."
Sanders will visit New Hampshire on Thursday. He was campaigning Tuesday in Iowa, where polls show him in a very tight contest with Clinton in the run-up to the Feb. 1 precinct caucuses.
