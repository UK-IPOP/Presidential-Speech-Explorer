President Obama met with Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves and Estonian Prime Minister Tavi Roivas in Tallinn, Estonia on September 3. The visit reinforced the close ties between the United States and Estonia, which are rooted in our shared values, ideals, and interests.
The leaders highlighted ongoing cooperation in the following areas:
•    
: In light of the Russian military intervention in Ukraine, the United States is demonstrating its continued commitment to collective security through a series of actions designed to reassure NATO Allies and partners of America's dedication to enduring peace and stability in the region. As a first response to demonstrate our commitment to the defense of our Allies, the U.S. augmented its participation in Baltic Air Policing by sending an additional six F-15s to the NATO mission. Under operation ATLANTIC RESOLVE, U.S. Army Europe forces have deployed to Estonia, along with other Allies in the region, to conduct land forces training. U.S. and Estonian troops participate in a range of other joint and multilateral exercises, including SABER STRIKE, BALTOPS, and STEADFAST JAZZ. Estonian soldiers and defense personnel also receive technical training and strategic education in the United States.
•    
 As NATO Allies, the United States and Estonia are committed to each other's defense and partner in critical areas around the world. Estonian and U.S. troops have a long history of operational deployments in countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan. Estonia hosts the NATO Cyber Security Center of Excellence and further demonstrates its commitment to transatlantic security as one of only a few NATO Allies that meet the NATO benchmark of spending at least two percent of GDP on defense.
•    
 Estonia's military maintains an active relationship with the Maryland National Guard through the State Partnership Program. The two have worked jointly to train Estonian helicopter pilots to support medical evacuation efforts in Afghanistan.
•    
 Estonia is a stalwart supporter of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) mission in Afghanistan and has committed to continue supporting NATO's post-2014 non-combat mission. In addition to providing $1.3 million in development assistance to Afghanistan in 2013, Estonia has pledged $500,000 annually from 2015 to 2017 to support the Afghan National Security Forces. Tallinn is also a key port along the Northern Distribution Network, which facilitates the transport of materiel to coalition troops in Afghanistan and serves as a retrograde route for materiel leaving the theater.
•    
 In December 2013, the United States and Estonia signed the U.S.-Estonia Cyber Partnership Statement on the margins of the NATO Ministerial meeting. This Statement affirms our commitment to continue working together to enhance open, interoperable, secure, and reliable information and communications infrastructure and to prioritize openness and innovation on the Internet. The United States and Estonia will continue to deepen their cooperation on Internet freedom and they will continue to develop shared programs that shape the evolution and use of the Internet. Estonian and American Computer Emergency Readiness Teams are in regular contact to respond to cyber incidents. Estonia also hosts the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence, which serves as a repository of expertise on cybersecurity issues.
•    
 Estonia has drawn on its transition experiences and cyber expertise to provide specialized development assistance in cybersecurity and the use of information technology to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery in the public sector. In addition to partnering with the U.S. government to support development projects in Moldova and Georgia through the Department of State's Emerging Donor Challenge Fund, Estonia mentors Eastern Partnership countries and other emerging democracies through the Tallinn-based e-Governance Center.
•    
 Estonia enjoys a high degree of energy self-sufficiency due to its large domestic oil shale reserves, from which the country derives approximately 91 percent of its electricity. In 2011, the United States and Estonia signed an Oil Shale Cooperation Agreement to promote research in this area.
•    
 Bilateral trade in goods with Estonia was $700 million in 2013. Estonia is increasing the pace of its engagement with the United States in the technology sector; the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Director visited Estonia in August and engaged with tech companies and start-ups. The government of Estonia has expressed strong support for the U.S.-EU Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) negotiations. T-TIP aims to boost economic growth in the United States and in the EU and add to the more than 13 million American and EU jobs already supported by transatlantic trade and investment. Estonia joined the OECD in 2010.
