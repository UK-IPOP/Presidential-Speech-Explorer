 Could you give us your assessment of your meeting with the Chinese leader?
 Well, I'm sure you've gotten a report. I think it went very well. It was a good meeting, and I think that the next steps were appropriate.
 You're looking forward, then, to going to Beijing?
 Very much.
 Mr. Prime Minister, the last time you met with Mr. Clinton, you gave him a saxophone. What are you going to do this time to make him happy? [

 And I played it, too.
 What should I do about that? I think you're giving me more difficult questions than you're giving to the President. Well, it's a diplomatic secret. [
