Your Majesty:
I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing of the Prime Minister, Field Marshal Srisdi Dhanarajata. On behalf of the Government and people of the United States of America, may I offer to Your Majesty our heartfelt sympathy and condolences. It was my privilege to meet Field Marshal Srisdi some two years ago, and I know the great contribution he had made to the continued progress and independence of the Kingdom as Prime Minister of Your Majesty's Government.
Your Nation has suffered a great loss which we as your friends and allies share with you. I know also the strength of the Thai Nation which, with Your Majesty's inspired leadership, will be sustained in this difficult hour.
