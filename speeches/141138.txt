President Trump was absolutely correct when he called on Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to "apologize for their reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric." Their words aren't just sowing fear and jeopardizing America's economic recovery and reopening â€“ they're risking American lives.
Our nation's top public health experts - including Dr. Fauci, Dr. Hahn, Dr. Collins, Dr. Adams, and Dr. Birx - have all assured Americans that Operation Warp Speed, the effort to develop a coronavirus vaccine, is focused on safety and efficacy, and free from political influence.
 Biden and Harris are deliberately undermining public confidence in the safety of the coronavirus vaccine and, without evidence, casting clouds of suspicion on its production:
Biden and Harris know full well what the experts have said about the vaccine. The fact that they refuse to say "yes, I will take the vaccine," when public health experts have already said it will be safe and untainted by politics is reckless and wrong.
