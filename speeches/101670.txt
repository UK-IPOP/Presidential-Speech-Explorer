Health reform legislation signed by President Obama includes a Small Business Health Care Tax Credit to help small businesses afford the cost of covering their workers.

•     
•     
•     
. The credit is effective January 1, 2010. As a result, small businesses that provide health care for their workers will receive immediate help with their premium costs, and additional firms that initiate coverage this year will get a tax cut as well.
•     
. The Council of Economic Advisors estimates that 4 million small businesses are eligible for the credit if they provide health care to their workers. Qualifying firms must have less than the equivalent of 25 full-time workers (e.g., a firm with fewer than 50 half-time workers would be eligible), pay average annual wages below $50,000, and cover at least 50 percent of the cost of health care coverage for their workers.
•     
. The credit is worth up to 35 percent of a small business's premium costs in 2010. On January 1, 2014, this rate increases to 50 percent.
•     
. Firms can claim the credit for 2010 through 2013 and for any two years after that.
•     
. Tax-exempt organizations are eligible for a 25 percent tax credit in 2010. In 2014, this rate increases to 35 percent. [1]
•     
. The credit phases out gradually for firms with average wages between $25,000 and $50,000 and for firms with the equivalent of between 10 and 25 full-time workers.
•     
. To avoid an incentive to choose a high-cost plan, an employer's eligible contribution is limited to the average cost of health insurance in that state.

. Small businesses want to provide health coverage for their workers, but they face extraordinary challenges in doing so, including premiums that are 18 percent higher on average than large businesses pay for the same coverage. Health reform legislation signed by the Presidents includes a number of important benefits to help make coverage more affordable:
1. 
.
•     
 Currently, small businesses face not only premiums that are 18 percent higher than large businesses pay, but also face higher administrative costs to set up and maintain a health plan. The premiums they pay have 3 to 4 times as much administrative cost built into them as plans in the large group market. They are also at a disadvantage in negotiating with insurance companies because they lack bargaining power.
•     
: Health reform will change this dynamic. Starting by 2014, firms with 100 or fewer workers will be able pool their buying power and reduce administrative costs by purchasing insurance through an exchange. According to CBO, coverage that small businesses purchased through an exchange "would have lower administrative costs, on average, than the policies those firms would buy under current law, particularly for very small firms."
•     
 Currently, small businesses with just one sick worker can face significantly higher premiums, and having a worker fall ill can lead to a precipitous price increase – raising premiums just when insurance is needed most.
•     
: Health reform will end this price discrimination. Starting in 2014, "community rating" rules will prohibit insurers from charging more to cover small businesses with sicker workers or raising rates when someone gets sick.
3. 
.
•     
 Our current health care system inhibits entrepreneurship and small business formation by locking workers — especially those with families or with any sort of health problem —into jobs at large firms that offer family coverage and have a big enough risk pool to absorb the cost of covering pre-existing conditions. This "job lock" causes many workers to stay at large firms even if they would be more productive working at a small business or becoming an entrepreneur.
•     
 By providing health security for every American and eliminating exclusions for pre-existing conditions and price discrimination against those who are sick, health reform will make it easier for small businesses to attract the best workers and easier for entrepreneurs to strike out on their own.
4. 
.
•     
: Currently, the cost of treating the uninsured adds a "hidden tax" of over $1,000 to every health care premium.
•     
: Health reform will significantly reduce this tax by covering an additional 32 million additional Americans by 2019.
5. 
.
•     
. In a recent national survey, nearly three-quarters of small businesses that did not offer benefits cited high premiums as the reason.
•     
 Taken together, the measures described above will significantly reduce premiums for small businesses. According to CBO, health reform will reduce the cost of a given plan in the small group market by 1-4 percent by 2016.
