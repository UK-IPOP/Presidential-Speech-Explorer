THE PRESIDENT today had the pleasure of meeting with Prime Minister Eqbal of Iran, who represented his country at the Central Treaty Organization Meeting which has just terminated. There was a very useful and interesting discussion concerning matters of mutual interest.
The President told the Prime Minister that Iran's courageous and unyielding stand in the face of the intensive and unwarranted propaganda attacks of recent months has evoked the admiration of all free nations. The President reaffirmed United States support for the collective efforts of Iran and other free nations to maintain their independence. In stressing the gravity with which the United States would view a threat to the territorial integrity and political independence of Iran, the President recalled the provisions of the Bilateral Agreement of Cooperation with Iran and the Joint Resolution to promote peace and stability in the Middle East.
