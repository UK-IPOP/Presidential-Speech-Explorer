The contrast between President Trump and Joe Biden could not be more clear.

, asBernie Sanders 
. Biden 
, and he voted to raise taxes on Social Security benefits. In 2007, Biden 
 he would "absolutely" look at all options regarding Social Security and 
 that Democrats "have to make tough decisions" on Social Security. Now, Biden is 
 while fully embracing the far left and 
 that illegal immigrants deserve to receive Social Security benefits.

 President Trump has also delivered other good results for seniors. He 
 an executive order to "protect and improve" Medicare with expanded payment options and fewer regulations. In fact, the number of Medicare Advantage plans available to seniors 
 by nearly 1,200 during the first two years of the Trump Administration, and premiums have 
 by 23% over the last two years. Prescription drug costs have 
 below historic trends, seniors 
 a boost in the value of their retirement accounts, and the Trump economy led to a 
 of 401(k) and IRA millionaires.

President Trump believes benefits like Social Security and Medicare should 
â€”not people who come into our country illegally. Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and the rest of the radical left are a different story. They will never put Americans first.
