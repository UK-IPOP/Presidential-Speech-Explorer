The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsements of 19 leading Massachusetts state legislators, reflecting Hillary's growing Bay State support.
"Hillary Clinton is the only one who can hit the ground running on her first day in the White House," said Assistant Majority Leader Lida Harkins, the highest-ranking woman in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. "Her combination of experience, toughness and vision make her the best candidate to be President."
"We need a leader like Hillary Clinton to bring an end to the war in Iraq and begin the process of repairing America's image around the world," said Senator Marc R. Pacheco, chairman of the Senate's Oversight Committee and the Senate Committee on Global Warming and Climate Change. "I have known Senator Clinton for nearly twenty years and have witnessed, time after time, her deep understanding of the issues that face our country and our communities."
Massachusetts Congressman Jim McGovern has also endorsed Hillary.
