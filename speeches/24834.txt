[Released August 17, 1965. Dated August 15, 1965] Mr. President:
My deep sympathy and that of the people of the United States goes out to you and the Chilean people as you move to relieve human suffering following in the wake of the second natural catastrophe which has struck your country this year.
I am proud to tell you that the people of the United States through the various U.S. private relief agencies, church world service, Catholic relief services (Caritas), CARE and others in cooperation with various public agencies are responding rapidly to the emergency in Chile.
An initial shipment of blankets, clothes and medicines will be arriving in Chile on Tuesday to be followed by other supplies in the coming days.
We are anxious and our hearts are saddened this Sunday at the disaster which has struck your country but with God's help and fraternal assistance we are confident that the Chilean people will overcome these difficulties.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[His Excellency, Eduardo Frei Montalva, President, Republic of Chile]
