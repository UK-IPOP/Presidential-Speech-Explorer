My fellow Americans:
I have proclaimed February as American Heart Month.
This month, we join the battle against the Nation's number one killer--heart disease and stroke.
We have far-reaching plans to combat these diseases.
But to carry forward on these plans, now-more than we have ever needed it before--we must have the help of our Heart Association.
We need the experience of its 35,000 physicians--the crusading spirit of its 2 million volunteers--and the expansion of its vital research, education, and community programs.
Your support of the Heart Fund this month will contribute to lengthening the lives of millions of your fellow Americans. So be generous--and if you do, you will be glad.
