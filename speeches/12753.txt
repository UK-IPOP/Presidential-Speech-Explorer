Both permits shall be carried on the person of the permittee when he is taking migratory waterfowl or their eggs and shall be exhibited to any person requesting to see them. Waterfowl and their eggs so taken may be possessed by the permittee and may be sold and transported by him for propagating purposes to any person holding a permit issued by the Secretary in accordance with the provisions of this regulation.
2. A person in possession of a valid, subsisting permit issued to him by a State, on its part, authorizing him to possess, buy, sell, and transport migratory waterfowl and their increase and eggs for propagating purposes, may possess, buy, sell, and transport such waterfowl and their increase and eggs for such purposes when authorized by a permit issued to him by the Secretary; and migratory waterfowl, except the birds taken under paragraph 1 of this regulation, so possessed may be killed by him at any time and in any manner (except that they may be killed by shooting only during the open season for waterfowl in the State where killed), and the carcasses, with heads and feet attached thereto, may be sold and transported by him to any person for actual consumption, or to the keeper of a hotel, restaurant, or boarding house, a retail dealer in meat or game, or a club, for sale or service to their patrons, who may possess such carcasses for actual consumption without a permit, but no such birds that have been killed shall be bartered, sold, or bought unless each bird before attaining the age of 4 weeks shall have had removed from the web of one foot a portion thereof in the form of a V large enough to make a permanent, well-defined mark, which shall be sufficient to identify it as a bird raised in domestication under a permit.
3. Applications for permits shall be addressed to the Secretary of Agriculture, Washington, D.C., and must state the name and address of the applicant; the place where the propagating project is to be carried on; the area to be used in the project; the facilities the applicant has for properly caring for the waterfowl; the number of each species of waterfowl in his possession, and how, when, and where they were acquired; and, if the application is for a permit to take migratory waterfowl or their eggs, the species and number of each species or eggs of each species proposed to be taken, and the specific locality where it is proposed to take them.
4. Every permittee shall keep books and records that shall correctly set forth the number of each species of waterfowl and their eggs taken by him, if he holds a permit to take waterfowl, the number of each species of waterfowl and their eggs possessed on the date of application for a permit to possess, sell, purchase, or transport such waterfowl, and on the 1st day of each September next following, and for each 12-month period thereafter during the life of the permit, the number of each species reared and killed, the number of each species and their eggs sold and transported, the manner in which such waterfowl and eggs were transported, the name and address of each person from or to whom waterfowl and eggs were purchased or sold, the number and species so purchased or otherwise acquired or sold and whether sold alive or dead, and the date of each transaction.

5. A permitee shall at all reasonable hours allow any authorized employee of the United States Department of Agriculture to enter and inspect the premises  where operations are being carried on under this regulation and to Inspect the books and records relating thereto.
6. No permit Issued by the Secretary authorizes the taking, possession, sale, purchase, exchange, or transportation of migratory waterfowl unless the permittee has in his possession while exercising any such privilege a valid, subsisting permit of equivalent tenor issued to him by the State in which he proposes to operate. Permits are not transferable and are revocable at any time in the discretion of the Secretary. A permit revoked by the Secretary shall be surrendered to him by the person to whom It was Issued on demand of any employee of the United States Department of Agriculture authorized to enforce the provisions of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.
7. A person may possess and transport, subject to the provisions of paragraph 8 of this regulation, for his own use, without a permit, live migratory waterfowl now lawfully possessed or hereafter lawfully acquired by him, but he may not purchase or sell such waterfowl without a permit. A State or municipal game farm or city park may possess, purchase, sell, and transport live migratory waterfowl without a permit, but no such waterfowl shall be purchased from or sold to a person (other than such State or municipal game farm or city park) unless he has a permit. Feathers of wild ducks and wild geese lawfully killed, and feathers of such birds seized and condemned by Federal or State game authorities, may be possessed, bought, sold and transported for use in making fishing flies, bed pillows, and mattresses, and for similar commercial purposes, but not for millinery or ornamental purposes.

Regulation 9, "Permits to Collect Migratory Birds for Scientific Purposes", is amended to read as follows:
A person in possession of a valid, subsisting permit issued to him by a State, on its part, authorizing him to take therein migratory birds or their nests or eggs for scientific purposes may take such birds or their nests or eggs in such State for such purposes when authorized by a permit issued to him by the Secretary. Both permits shall be carried on his person when he is collecting migratory birds thereunder and shall be exhibited to any person requesting to see them; but nothing herein shall be deemed to permit the taking of any migratory game bird during the open season therefor in any manner or by any means or at any time of day not permitted by regulations 3 and 4 of these regulations.
Application for a permit shall be addressed to the Secretary of Agriculture, Washington, D.C., and must state the name and address of the applicant, his age, the State or Territory in which specimens are proposed to be taken, the purpose for which they are intended, information sufficient to show that specimens permitted to be taken will be devoted to scientific purposes, and the names and addresses of at least two well-known ornithologists, principals or superintendents of educational or zoological institutions, officials or members of zoological or natural history organizations, or instructors in zoology in high schools, colleges, or universities, from whom may be obtained information respecting the applicant's status as a scientific investigator. The applicant must furnish such other information touching his fitness to be entrusted with a permit as may be called for by the Secretary.
A permit may limit the number and species of migratory birds or their nests or eggs that may be taken thereunder, and the places where, time when, and means by which they may be taken, and may authorize the holder thereof, when possessed of an equivalent State permit, to possess, buy, sell, exchange, and transport migratory birds and their nests and eggs for scientific purposes; or it may limit the holder to one or more of these privileges. Public museums, zoological parks and societies, and public scientific and educational Institutions may possess, buy, sell, exchange, and transport migratory birds and their nests and eggs for scientific purposes, without a permit, but no specimens shall be taken without a permit or purchased from or exchanged with a person not authorized by a permit to sell or exchange them. The plumage and skins of migratory game birds legally taken may be possessed and transported by a person without a permit.
A taxidermist, when authorized by a permit issued by the Secretary, may possess any migratory bird delivered to him for mounting or like preparation by any person who has lawfully taken or lawfully possesses such bird, and may transport such specimen in consummation of such purpose when likewise authorized by the State in which such permittee is operating. Every such permittee shall keep books and records correctly setting forth the name and address of each person delivering each specimen of migratory bird to him, together with the name of each species, the date of delivery, the disposition of each specimen, and the date thereof, and such books and records shall be available for inspection at all reasonable hours on request of any authorized representative of the Department of Agriculture.
No permit issued by the Secretary authorizes the taking, possession, sale, purchase, exchange, or transportation of any migratory bird unless the permittee has in his possession while exercising any such privilege a valid, subsisting permit of equivalent tenor issued to him by the State in which he proposes to operate. Permits are not transferable and are revocable at any time in the discretion of the Secretary. A permit revoked by the Secretary shall be surrendered to him by the person to whom issued, on demand of any employee of the United States Department of Agriculture authorized to enforce the provisions of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. A person holding a permit under this regulation shall report annually to the Secretary, on or before the 10th day of January, the number of birds or nests or eggs of each species taken, bought, sold, received, possessed, mounted, exchanged, or transported during the preceding 12 months, and failure to make such report will be cause for revocation of the permit.
Every package in which migratory birds or their nests or eggs are transported by any means whatever for scientific purposes, from one State, Territory, or the District of Columbia, to, into, or through another State, Territory, or the District of Columbia, or to or from a foreign country shall be plainly and clearly marked or labeled on the outside thereof to show the name and address of consignor and consignee, the contents of the package by number and kind, the number of the permit under authority of which it is transported, and that the specimens contained therein are for scientific purposes. Every package in which migratory birds or their nests or eggs are shipped wholly within a State or Territory, for scientific purposes, shall be plainly and clearly marked or labeled on the outside thereof in the manner above prescribed.
 upon consideration it appears that approval of the foregoing amendatory regulations will tend to effectuate the purposes of the aforesaid Migratory Bird Treaty Act and result in reducing the annual kill of migratory game birds:
, President of the United States of America, do hereby approve and proclaim the foregoing amendatory regulations.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 12th day of August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-first.
