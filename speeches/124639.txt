Today The Nashua Telegraph endorsed Ohio Gov. John Kasich's campaign for President. The endorsement comes the day after two other New Hampshire newspapers, The Portsmouth Herald and the Foster's Daily Democrat, endorsed Kasich as well.
"We think executive experience matters. For that reason, we lean toward governors, and it's Kasich, we think, who offers the best chance to move the country in the right direction..."
"He opted not to become a congressional lifer, evidence that while Kasich was indoctrinated in the Washington culture, he was not infected by it."
"Kasich is a pragmatic problem-solver who looks first for conservative, common-sense solutions."
"He also understands that our national security is fundamentally tied to our economic growth and that the ocean of government red ink in which Americans are swimming is really a riptide that serves as a drag on the economy and, if not curbed, will eventually undermine the readiness of our military."
"Because he has both an executive and legislative background, Kasich strikes us as the candidate most likely to bridge the executive-congressional divide to reduce the federal debt, strengthen the military and put our economy on sound footing."
