Dear Mr. Keyserling:
Thank you for transmitting to me the report on the New England economy submitted to the Council of Economic Advisers.
Studies of regional economic problems can be a valuable aid in development of national economic policies and I hope that this study of New England's long-run problems will contribute to future planning for the economic growth and progress of the nation.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Honorable Leon H. Keyserling, Chairman, Council of Economic Advisers, Washington 25, D.C.]
