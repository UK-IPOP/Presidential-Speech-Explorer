 - Today during the Des Moines Register presidential debate, Bill Richardson said he would pass and implement universal healthcare in his first term. The real story is that Richardson promised to achieve universal care during his first term as Governor of New Mexico and when he failed, revised the timeline during his re-election bid. Yet, the goal of universal healthcare in New Mexico remains unfulfilled. Richardson has said the race for president is one for a "promotion," yet he has made rosy promises of achieving universal health care in the first year of his presidency without raising taxes to pay for it.

 The 
 reported, "Richardson tells Democratic voters that as president, he would deliver health coverage to all Americans. But after 4 1/2 years as governor, the universal coverage that was his goal is still just a dream in New Mexico. About one in four state residents under age 65 is uninsured, according to a recent report. Among New Mexicans of all ages, about one in five lacks insurance â€” putting the state just behind neighboring Texas, which is ranked worst in the nation." [

 During a March 2007 health care forum sponsored by the Center for American Progress and SEIU, Bill Richardson was asked "how quickly under your plan do you think you could get to true universal coverage." Richardson said, "[W]hat we're talking about is I believe a very aggressive plan with new ideas that could be achieved the first year that I'm president." [Richardson Remarks at health care Forum,

 Bill Richardson said during an AARP forum on health care, "I have a disagreement with Senator Edwards in how you pay for it, for a new health care plan. I think the first thing we need to do is we pay $2.2 trillion in health care in this country. Thirty-one percent of it is administration; is bureaucracy; is lack of electronic filing records. It's HMO overhead. It's insurance company rip-offs. That is one-third that doesn't go into direct care. You have to shift that, first, to director care." [AARP "Divided We Fail" Forum, 9/20/07]
