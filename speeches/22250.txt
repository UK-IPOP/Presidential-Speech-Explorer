I WANT to tell you how pleased we are that you could come here to the White House and receive this great honor. This will always be a memorable day for you, to come to the first home of the land, and to be awarded this citation by the School Safety Patrol.
Nothing gives me more pleasure than to recognize the outstanding achievements of young people like you. Very often in America we tend to publicize the few youngsters who go wrong. We very often fail to mention the many youngsters who go right, according to the very best in American life.
There are achievements and excellence of all kinds, but one of the most heartwarming and one of the most soul stirring is an act of bravery. And when this act of bravery is performed by a young person, the whole rest of the society feels better.
The five Safety Patrols here today are heroes. Each of them, without regard for his or her own safety, saved the life of a fellow student. I am proud and I am happy to present the AAA Gold Lifesaving Medal to each of these outstanding youngsters. I know how proud their families, their mothers and their fathers, and the people from their State, their Congressmen and their Senators, who are here today, must be, and particularly the people of their neighborhood, how proud they must feel about what you have done.
So your President congratulates you and says thanks to you on behalf of a grateful Nation. We will always remember your act of bravery and we hope that you got as much satisfaction out of performing the task as we do out of giving you this little recognition today.
Thank you very much.
