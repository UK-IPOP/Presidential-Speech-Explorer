The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 5465 because:


— 
 — On average, consumers would have to spend an estimated extra $1.4 billion per year on appliance purchases. Higher prices would force many to buy more expensive appliances than they would have otherwise, and may force some to delay or forego some appliance purchases altogether. By eliminating the lower-priced models, the bill would hit low-income consumers particularly hard. It could also discourage and slow the introduction of useful product innovations; and

— 
 to the extent that justifies the bill's almost insurmountable obstacles to States attaining exemptions from Federal standards. Further, the bill allows no realistic way to adjust the Federal standards to regional or local priorities or conditions.
