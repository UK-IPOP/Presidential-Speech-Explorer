America has a growing, dynamic, and changing economy - but our tax code has not kept up with the times. The current tax code is a maze of special interest loopholes that causes America's taxpayers to spend more than six billion hours every year on paperwork and other headaches. President Bush believes that America's taxpayers deserve, and our future economic prosperity demands, a simpler, fairer, pro-growth system - and he has pledged to lead a bipartisan effort to reform and simplify the tax code.
The time that people spend complying with an overly complex tax code is a burden and a waste of resources that has been growing over time.
