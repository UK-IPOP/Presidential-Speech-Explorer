Yesterday, President Biden presented the Build Back Better Framework to Congress, and highlighted its transformative investment in climate, care, and kids, that will lower the costs of things families depend on, help people get back to work, and grow the economy.
The Framework is designed to level the playing field and make corporations and the wealthiest pay their fair share, so that middle class families can finally get some breathing room.?
President Biden heard input from all sides and announced a Build Back Better framework he is confident will pass through Congress and be signed into law, delivering generational investments in the economy for working people.
The Build Back Better Framework will transform the lives of millions of children, saving parents thousands of dollars, and adding two years of free, universal schooling to our education system for the first time in over 100 years. It will be the largest effort to combat climate change in history. It will cut taxes for tens of millions of middle-class families. It is the biggest expansion of affordable health care in a decade. As the President said, it's a big darn deal.
State, local, and tribal leaders applauded the President and praised the framework.
California's values will be on the national stage with the Build Back Better plan. @POTUS is creating good jobs, investing in clean energy to fight climate change, helping families through at-home elder, disability & child care, universal pre-k, & more.? [

Cities, towns and villages across the country are ready to rebuild and recover from the impacts of the COVID pandemic. The Build Back Better Act lays out a plan to create millions of jobs, support families and children, and combat the climate crisis. Alongside the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, this legislation paves the way for cities to empower residents and build sustained recovery. We urge Congress to bring both bills to a vote quickly. The framework released today includes important provisions NLC and city leaders have been advocating for, with investments in clean energy, resilience, housing affordability and workforce development. It is our hope that the administration and Congressional leadership will continue to build on the investments in this package by continuing to prioritize combating the climate crisis and investing in workforce development.

BREAKING: The #BuildBackBetter framework is historic!
Tax cuts for working families
Climate action
Health care
Child care
Lower costs of everyday essentials
Immigration

 San Diego is ready to support @POTUS's #BuildBackBetter agenda & prepare to provide critical services to our communities, including vital investments in infrastructure & environmental justice. Federal investments in the arteries of our local economy will help us more effectively circulate goods and services, and increase opportunities to create good-paying, union jobs. Replacing outdated lead pipes keeps families safe from dangerous toxins and clean water flowing to neighborhoods; expanding accessible broadband services ensures children can do their homework at home; and putting cleaner, GHG-reducing transportation options on our roads and rails will protect our environment and connect workers to jobs. These are some of the benefits President Joe Biden's Build Back Better Agenda will bring to San Diego County. It is not everything we hoped for but these are critical investments that are long overdue and I hope Congress finds a way to deliver this funding soon. [

Thanks to President Biden and Connecticut's Congressional delegation, the Affordable Care Act is poised to become truly affordable, Senator Lesser said. The framework announced today will dramatically lower premiums and out-of-pocket deductibles for Connecticut residents who purchase health insurance on AccessHealth Connecticut, a huge win for families and small businesses across our state. Recently, I spoke to a middle-class Danbury resident whose family will be saving $1,200 a month - let's be honest, that's life changing. [

 The Build Back Better framework announced by President Biden today represents a historic opportunity to address some of our country's biggest challenges and inequities. I urge members of Congress to pass legislation based on this framework.? The pandemic has highlighted and exacerbated shortcomings in our social safety net. State and local leaders fighting for more equitable access to critical needs will be especially grateful for an infusion of federal support for affordable health care, early education, and economic opportunity for all Americans. Furthermore, after years of being on their own in responding to a dangerously warming climate, NewDEAL Leaders are thrilled to see that the framework includes unprecedented resources for a clean energy future and advances key initiatives they have pursued in areas like electric vehicles and renewable power. This legislation also sets the stage for passage of the bipartisan infrastructure bill approved by the Senate, which will invest in major projects and priorities that state and local officials have long [Statement, 10/28/21]
 The @WhiteHouse announced $1.75 trillion in #BuildBackBetter framework with large investments in child care, infrastructure, and more. Lawmakers will finalize bill text on the proposed budget reconciliation package in the coming days. [
