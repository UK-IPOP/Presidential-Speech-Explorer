Dear Mr. Secretary:
Thank you for the copy of the second annual report of the President's Missile Sites Labor Commission.
The progress that has been made to reduce labor disputes at missile and space sites since the establishment of the Commission is encouraging and deserves the attention and praise of all citizens.
The labor and management representatives on the Commission and at the sites are to be congratulated for helping to reduce to a minimum the work time lost because of disputes. Since I established the Commission in May 1961, these efforts have resulted in a 91.9 percent reduction in the amount of work time lost. I am pleased to see that during the year covered by this report, only one day was lost to labor disputes for every 1288 worked. This is a 1200 percent improvement over the one day lost out of each 96 worked before the Commission was set up.
Americans can be proud of and secure in the fact, that as a result of the improved labor situation, every missile site has been finished either on or before schedule.
Please convey my thanks and best wishes to the members of the Commission.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
[The Honorable W. Willard Wirtz, Secretary of Labor, Chairman, President's Missile Sites Labor Commission, Washington 25, D.C.]
