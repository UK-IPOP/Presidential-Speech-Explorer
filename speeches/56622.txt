This restriction is fundamentally inconsistent with the bill's objective of increasing competition. It is also inconsistent with other congressional efforts to reduce potential antitrust liabilities that may deter legitimate and procompetitive research and production joint ventures. Should antitrust issues arise, the Department of Justice will use its authority to ensure compliance with U.S. antitrust law; the blanket prohibition should be deleted from S. 173.

A legislative remedy is not needed, and these provisions should be deleted from the bill.
