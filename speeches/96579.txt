Sioux Falls, SD - Senator Barack Obama's South Dakota campaign today begins airing a new radio ad featuring former South Dakota Senator and U.S. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle. In the ad, Daschle - who was one of Obama's earliest public supporters - asks South Dakotans to join him in backing the candidate who will "put you first - not the special interests."
"When milk and gas are both pushing 4 dollars a gallon, and jobs are hard to find, it's time for a president who will change things," Daschle says in the ad - entitled "Rebuild South Dakota."
Daschle also discusses Obama's background as a community organizer who worked in the churches to help those who lost their jobs when the steel plants closed, and adds, "it's no surprise Barack's plan invests in our economy. He'll stop sending billions to Iraq and end this war. And he'll end tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas."
