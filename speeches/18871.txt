Your Majesty, Distinguished and Honored Guests from your country, and Friends:

It is truly an honor and a privilege to welcome to this country, on behalf of the American people, King Hussein of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.
He has been admired as the head of his nation, but he has also been so courageous that his name has become symbolic of courage in the world.
Since the American people, Your Majesty, honor and admire courage as much as any other quality, they have for you a real feeling of friendliness and admiration. They recognize what the leaders of your country, headed by yourself, have been able to do in the face of very great trials and pressures. You have withstood the temptations that have been placed before you to weaken in defense of your principles and your rights.
So I am sure this company would like to give a salute to you in a toast to your health and happiness and prosperity.

Gentlemen, His Majesty the King
