I transmit herewith a communication from the Secretary of War, inclosing a report of Captain M. C. Meigs, stating that the sum of $750,000 will be necessary for the prosecution of the Capitol extension until the close of the next session of Congress, and recommend that that amount may be appropriated.
FRANKLIN PIERCE.
