 certain public lands contiguous to the Death Valley National Monument, established by the Proclamation of February 11, 1933 (47 Stat. 2554), have situated thereon various objects of historic and scientific interest, and are necessary for the proper care, management and protection of unusual features of scientific interest within the said monument; and
