On Fox and Friends, Newt discussed the president's jobs speech and why its important to stand up to the bias of the elite media.
He also released this statement: Last night President Obama called for a sequel to his failed stimulus, proving he continues to support the same destructive, job-killing policies that created the Obama Depression. If the jobs weren't shovel ready after his $800 billion stimulus, which the president himself admitted, why will this be different? After repeatedly calling on Congress to pass his American Jobs Act immediately â€“ we discover there is no bill and no plan to pay for it. President Obama continues to ignore facts and instead doubles down on failed economic policies. We need real leadership now that uses proven policies from the Reagan presidency and my Speakership to empower Americans to create jobs.
