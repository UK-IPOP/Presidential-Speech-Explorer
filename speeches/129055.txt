 Thank you very much. We appreciate it. President Putin and I have been discussing various things, and I think it's going very well. We've had some very, very good talks. We're going to have a talk now, and obviously, that will continue.

But we look forward to a lot of very positive things happening for Russia, for the United States, and for everybody concerned. And it's an honor to be with you. Thank you.

. Your Excellency, Mr. President, we spoke over the phone with you several times on very important bilateral and international issues. Well, phone conversation is never enough, definitely. [
] But if we want to have a positive development in bilaterals and be able to resolve most acute international politics and issues, definitely, we need personal meetings.

And I'm delighted to be able to meet you personally, Mr. President. And I hope, as you have said, our meeting will yield positive resultsâ€”[
