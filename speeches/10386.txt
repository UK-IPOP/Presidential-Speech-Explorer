My dear Mr. Minister:
I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of June 24th resigning as American Minister to Czechoslovakia. I must, of course, accept it. I do so with the deepest regret because of the distinguished service you have rendered and the fine place you have been able to make for yourself in the Diplomatic Service.
You have always been a public spirited citizen, working for the best interests of your state and of the nation and I know that whether in diplomatic work or at home, you will continue to render valuable service. Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER

[Hon. A. C. Ratshesky, Minister to Czechoslovakia, Prague, Czechoslovakia]
