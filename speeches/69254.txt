The Administration is committed to enactment of meaningful budget enforcement. Consistent with the bipartisan budget agreement, both the House-passed and Senate-passed reconciliation bills include effective budget enforcement mechanisms: (1) establishment of statutory discretionary caps through 2002, enforced by the current law sequester mechanism; (2) extension of PAYGO restrictions on new mandatory spending and revenue losses; and (3) protection of the reconciliation savings by reducing PAYGO balances to zero. We strongly support these important budget enforcement provisions.
However, the Administration is unable to support H.R. 2003 because it would impose an unworkable and unadministrable system of constraints and automatic triggers on the Federal Budget. The bill calls for a complicated series of projections and findings that could result in automatic entitlement cuts and tax cut suspensions that would be unprecedented in the Federal budgeting system. Following are a few of the practical difficulties raised by the bill.
We recognize that the sponsors believe these effects will not occur in practice because of the expedited procedures for Congressional action contained in the bill. However, the Administration believes that the policy choices inherent in the bill as written are very problematic.
For these reasons, the Administration cannot support H.R. 2003 and urges the conferees to include in Reconciliation, the extensions of PAYGO and discretionary caps as provided for in the bipartisan budget agreement.
