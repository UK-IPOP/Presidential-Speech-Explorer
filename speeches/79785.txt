The welfare reform bill approved by the Senate Finance Committee today is a significant step backward from our efforts to move even more people from welfare to work. The administration and the House of Representatives worked hard to strengthen work requirements, encourage strong families and healthy marriages, and provide ample funding to help people as they move into the workforce. Today's vote undermines and weakens our efforts, and abandons fiscal responsibility. There is still time left to pass a strong bill this year, but the Senate must act quickly to strengthen this legislation so that it more closely reflects the President's priorities.
