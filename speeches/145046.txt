Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced a comprehensive strategy to combat violent crime and gun violence. This strategy implements preventative measures that are proven to reduce violent crime, and attacks the root causes – including by addressing the flow of firearms used to commit crimes.
A critical element of the strategy is the historic $350 billion in state and local funding in his American Rescue Plan, which has empowered cities and states across the country to take action to ensure the safety and well-being of their communities – including by hiring cops and bolstering community policing, as well as supporting investments in a range of programs that are proven to reduce gun violence and violent crime. Today's strategy builds on that by providing further guidance for states and cities to expand their ability to improve public safety in their communities.
