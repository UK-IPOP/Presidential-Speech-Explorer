The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 3562 because it would:


— Increase direct spending without any offsets.

— Divert Customs Forfeiture Fund revenues that would otherwise reduce the deficit to support drug rehabilitation programs that are adequately provided for from other accounts. The President's FY 1993 Budget allocates almost $35 million from the Office of National Drug Control Policy's Special Forfeiture Fund for similar programs. 


H.R. 3562 would Increase direct spending, thereby increasing the deficit for the purposes of the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA). Absent enactment of offsetting direct spending cuts or revenue increases, this could trigger a sequester of budgetary resources.

OMB's preliminary scoring estimates of this bill are presented in the table below. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from these estimates. If H.R. 3562 were enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published within five days of enactment, as required by OBRA. The cumulative effects of all enacted legislation on direct spending will be issued in monthly reports transmitted to the Congress.
