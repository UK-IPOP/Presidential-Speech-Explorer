CITATION TO ACCOMPANY THE AWARD OF THE
MEDAL FOR MERIT
TO
MR. RUDOLPH FORSTER (DECEASED)
HE SERVED his Government faithfully, intelligently, and modestly for a period which spanned almost a third of our national existence, assisting eight Presidents through peace and war, through good times and bad, in the solution of the multitude of administrative problems, related to every branch of a great Government's activities, which find their way to the White House; he distinguished himself, from the beginning of the present emergency, by outstanding success in expediting critical decisions and actions when every minute gained was important in the over-all strategy of the war; and he thereby rendered a service of incalculable value to all of his fellow citizens.

FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT
