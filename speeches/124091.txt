 — The Eagle-Tribune endorses Rubio in New Hampshire

— EagleTrib (@EagleTrib) 
Rubio . . . is a solid conservative who offers real solutions to the nation's pressing problems.
Rubio believes in a strong national defense because he recognizes that a powerful America is less vulnerable to attack than a weak nation. He would begin to rebuild and modernize the military. He would restore economic sanctions against Iran until that nation gives up its nuclear ambitions.
Strong conservative values, trustworthiness and intelligence  — without the shouting. That's Marco Rubio, the right choice for New Hampshire and, ultimately, the nation.
