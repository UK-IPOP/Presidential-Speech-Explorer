The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 4174 because it would:


— allow tribal contractors to be treated as Federal agencies for purposes of the Federal Tort Claims Act, thus allowing certain tribal contractors to pass their liabilities on to the Federal Government;

— create a new, unnecessary layer of bureacracy to manage tribal contracting; and

— establish a rebuttable presumption that tribal contractors should be exempted from Federal contracting laws and regulations, and limit the basis on which the Secretary can refuse exemption.
