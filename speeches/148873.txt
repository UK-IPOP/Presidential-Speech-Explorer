President Biden, who was wearing an Airpod in his right ear, did not respond to a question about whether China was helping Russia.
The Bidens rode back past the pool at Gordons Pond at 11:35 a.m., completing a loop on the park's bike path. This time, the President was riding slightly ahead of the First Lady, who wished the press pool "Happy Spring." The President did not respond to a request from a reporter to stop and chat.
While the pool was waiting for the Bidens, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki tweeted that the President will not be visiting Ukraine when he is in Europe next week.
President Biden and the First Lady arrived at Gordons Pond at 1:07 p.m. The President waived to the press as he boarded Marine One at 1:08 p.m., and the helicopter lifted off at 1:12 p.m.
