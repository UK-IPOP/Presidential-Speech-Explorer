 Welcome. Is everybody having a nice day here?
 Yes. The lobsters are good.
 They are good.
 Sir, are you going to take him fishing?
 We might just do that, yes. Not sure yet, Mark.
 Today?
 Maybe today. It's pretty casual up here, as you know—unstructured.
 ——the menu?
 Lobster; what else? [

 How was the fishing today, sir?
 Lousy. [
] Was that you, Chuck, the other day? No wonder we didn't catch any fish. They took a look at you and—[
]—headed out.
 Sir, while you're waiting, can you tell us what you think of those terrorist incidents in Britain and Scotland?
 We got a press conference tomorrow, Mark. But it just goes to show the war against these extremists goes on. You never know where they may try to strike. And appreciate the very strong response that the Gordon Brown Government has given to the attempts by these people.

 Everybody been behaving themselves?
 You sure you won't come back here a little more often? [
]
 That's what I figured. [
]
 I wasn't going to give you the satisfaction—[
].
 That's what I thought, yes. Well, the guy is counting the days in Crawford, you know. [
]
 I'm counting your days here too—35.
 Are you watching any baseball?
 I watched the Ranger-Red Sox game today.
 Is it over? Did they win today too?
 I think they won today too.
 But the Yankees lost.
 They did?

 Where did these guys all come from? When I left there was nobody here.
 Come over, Condi. Come on, Bill.
Okay? It's been real. [
] Thanks for coming.
