"Newt Gingrich's Freddie Mac contract raises more questions than answers. His secrecy about his lobbying for Freddie Mac is troubling. No amount of bluster will hide the fact that Newt had his hand in Freddie Mac to the tune of $25,000 a month.  The bursting housing bubble helped lead to the current economic crisis and Newt Gingrich has his fingerprints all over it. His shifting explanations amount to a shell game with the truth. Speaker Gingrich needs to fully disclose his work as a lobbyist for Freddie Mac." —Gail Gitcho, Romney Communications Director
 — Officials At His Company Say They "Can't Find" His Other Contracts. "Newt Gingrich's consulting firm tonight released a copy of its 2006 contract with Freddie Mac, which covers just one year of his multiple years of service and documents only $300,000 of the $1.6 million he received from the mortgage company. The Republican hopeful's first contract ... wasn't released because officials at the Center for Health Transformation can't find it, said Susan Meyers, a center spokeswoman who also works for the Gingrich campaign." (Clea Benson and Julie Bykowicz, "Gingrich Firm Releases Freddie Mac Contract,"

 "Gingrich has always maintained that he never lobbied for Freddie Mac but served as an advisor and historian. The documents ... offer little insight. ... Under the scope of services section, the contract says, 'Consultant will provide consulting and related services as requested by Freddie Mac's Director, Public Policy in exchange for which Freddie Mac will pay consultant $25,000 per each full calendar month during which Consultant provided Services.'"
