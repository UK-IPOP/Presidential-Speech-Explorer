[Released June 13, 1931. Dated June 12, 1931]
I AM SADDENED to learn of the death of your husband Dr. Franklin Henry Giddings and extend my deep sympathy to you. Dr. Giddings' career as an educator and author was an unusually fruitful one, and his thinking has made a permanent and significant contribution to the science of sociology.
