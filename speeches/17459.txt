ON BEHALF of the American people I wish to express my deep appreciation to you for your thoughtful message sent at the conclusion of your recent visit to the United States. It was indeed a pleasure for Mrs. Eisenhower and me to have had Your Majesty and Empress Soraya as our guests.
I am also happy that your visit gave so many Americans an opportunity to become better acquainted with you both. Your sincerity and strength of purpose have increased the bonds of friendship between our countries.
I feel certain that under your able leadership your country will progress and will continue to contribute to the enduring peace which we both so earnestly desire.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
