 Have you worked out today, sir?
 This afternoon. As you know, I'm giving a speech tonight, the Sullivan speech. So after working all day long, before the speech, I'll work out. I'm going to lift weights. I'm going to do a little elliptical training. I'm going to do some physical fitness stuffâ€”not an outdoor run today.
 How's the other speech coming?
 The speech I'm giving tonight?
 No, the other one.
 I'll give it at the appropriate time. Thank you all.
