 "Sarah Palin was supposed to fall off the stage at her vice presidential debate Thursday evening. Instead, she ended up dominating it. She not only kept Joe Biden on the defensive for much of the debate, she not only repeatedly attacked Barack Obama, but she looked like she was enjoying herself while doing it. She smiled. She faced the camera. She was warm. She was human. Gosh and golly, she even dropped a bunch of g's." (Roger Simon, "You Betcha Sarah Palin Can Debate," 
, 10/2/08) 
 "Combining a happy warrior spirit with a home-spun style and some substance thrown in to boot, Palin proved that she belonged on that stage with Joe Biden tonight." (David Brody, "Palin Hurdles Over The Bar In VP Debate," Christian Broadcasting Network's "Brody File," 10/3/08) 
 "As for Palin, she seemed to hit her stride tonight. She offered more substance on issues like healthcare, energy policy, taxes and even Darfur by explaining how her role as Governor played a part." (David Brody, "Palin Hurdles Over The Bar In VP Debate," Christian Broadcasting Network's "Brody File," 10/3/08) 
 " In a fast-paced exchange about a range of domestic and foreign policy issues, she was the aggressive campaigner who in the first weeks of her candidacy had so energized the Republican faithful." (Dan Balz, "Palin Delivers, But Doubts Linger," 
, 10/3/08) 
 "From the minute Palin walked onstage and said, 'Nice to meet you, Joe -- can I call you Joe?' she had her performance down. It was very winning and very appealing and we saw that throughout the debate." (George Stephanopoulos, "Stephanopoulos: VP Debate Report Card," ABC News, 10/3/08) 
 "Gov. Sarah Palin, once again, confounded her critics with a strong performance. She did it at the Republican convention, and she did it again last night in her debate with Sen. Joe Biden. She performed with poise and charm. She effectively made the case that Senator Obama would be nave in foreign policy and harmful to economic growth, and that Senator McCain would be a common-sense reformer." (Editorial, "Palin's Triumph," 
, 10/3/08) 
 "She handled questions about Iraq, Afghanistan, and Iran well. She connected domestic-policy arguments to the lives of average voters. Anyone who hoped -- or feared -- that she would fall flat on her face was proven wrong." (Editorial, "Palin's Triumph," 
, 10/3/08) 
 "Palin delivered a strong and sure performance Thursday night." (Byron York, "Sarah Palin, The Winner By A Wink," 
, 10/3/08) 
 "Eight real-life 'hockey moms' plucked from the ice to watch the vice-presidential face-off last night said their high-profile counterpart from Alaska dealt her critics a bell-ringing body check." (Brendan Scott, "Sarah Scores!" 
, 10/3/08) 
 
 "Sarah Palin gave as good as she got in her televised faceoff with Joe Biden Thursday night - and by that measure she shored up her standing as John McCain's vice presidential running mate. Palin sailed through the 90 minutes with none of the unsteadiness she had shown in TV interviews. She was both assured and down-home folksy in arguing the case for McCain and against Barack Obama."

, 10/3/08) 
 "Last night was a big, big win for Sarah Palin. She showed originality, charisma and sass - a style that is refreshing and different in our politics. She didn't just win the vice-presidential debate, she showed that she belongs with Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton as among the best communicators of our modern political times." (Dick Morris and Eileen McGann, Op-Ed, "Palin Wins Big With A Reagan-Like Flair," 
, 10/3/08) 
 "A confident, folksy Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin attacked the Democratic presidential ticket Thursday over tax hikes and partisanship, holding her own against her vice-presidential rival, Delaware Sen. Joe Biden." (Laura Meckler, "Biden, Palin Clash On Taxes, Iraq In Sharp-Edged Debate," 
, 10/3/08) 
 
 "She won because to a vast majority of those who watched the debate tonight she likely came off as a plausible vice president. And that was all that mattered." (Stephen Hayes, Op-Ed, "A Plausible Vice President," 
, 
 , 10/3/08) 
 "But Palin kept her cool, stayed on her game and lived up to her reputation as a spirited debater. She played to her strengths -- her ability to connect with people like a neighbor and her resilience. Despite the contempt and criticism she's endured in recent days, she walked onto the stage like a candidate on top of the world. She shook hands with Biden and said 'Hey, can I call you Joe?' That opening line was friendly, down-to-earth and said, 'We're equals.'" (Editorial, "Palin Hits Her Stride," 
, 10/3/08) 
 "This thing's not over yet. She held her own. In what was likely one of the most-watched vice presidential debates in the country's history, Sarah Palin went in as the underdog Thursday night and came out of it with nary a scratch." (Editorial, "Palin Has Fun, Holds Her Own In Tepid Veep Debate," 
, 10/3/08) 
 "In her opening answer to a question about the troubled economy, Palin spoke with clarity and confidence and got to the heart of the matter with the kind of populist candor she displayed at the Republican National Convention. 'Go to a kid's soccer game on Saturday and ask any parent what they think about the economy, and I betcha you're going to hear about fear,' Palin said. 'Our economy is hurting.'" (Editorial, "Palin Has Fun, Holds Her Own In Tepid Veep Debate,"

 "Most effectively, perhaps, she turned Biden's past criticisms of Obama's plans for Iraq against Biden, adding, 'John McCain knows how to win a war.'" (Editorial, "Sarah Palin Scores," [New York] 
, 10/3/08) 
 "Sarah Palin used folksy language, winks, smiles and sharp elbows to try to put seasoned rival Joe Biden on the defensive in last night's vice-presidential debate." (Geoff Earle, "Pit Bull Sarah Shows Her Bite," 
, 10/3/08) 
 
 "When Biden complained that Republicans have taken to repeating the 'drill, drill, drill' mantra, she owned it and gently corrected him. 'I think the chant is drill, baby, drill.' It was a clever turn, and judging from virtually every poll on the issue, it was politically very smart." (Stephen Hayes, Op-Ed, "A Plausible Vice President," 
, 
 , 10/3/08) 
 "Appearing assertive and confident in her national debate premiere, Palin battled Sen. Joseph Biden on a broad range of issues -- the Wall Street meltdown, taxes and spending, Iraq, foreign relations, which candidate best represents change -- and more than held her own." (Steve Huntley, Op-Ed, "Palin Eases GOP Jitters, You Betcha," 
, 10/3/08) 
 "On international issues, the area where she has been considered to be weak, Palin appeared to get under Biden's skin when she criticized Barack Obama for saying he would meet without preconditions with some of the world's worse dictators. Biden's face turned grim, and he went so far as to deny that Obama had ever said he would meet without preconditions with the president of Iran, when in fact the Democratic presidential nominee said that during the primary." (Steve Huntley, Op-Ed, "Palin Eases GOP Jitters, You Betcha," 
, 10/3/08) 
 "Oh, and by the way, she morphed into 'Sarah Barracuda' tonight by using Biden's past statements on Obama against him. She had it all working tonight." (David Brody, "Palin Hurdles Over The Bar In VP Debate," Christian Broadcasting Network's "Brody File," 10/3/08) 
 "The Republican nominee more than held her own on foreign policy in general, and in our view won on points at least on Iraq and Afghanistan. She didn't let Mr. Biden get away with interpreting the comments of a U.S. general in Afghanistan as a rejection of Mr. McCain's strategy. And on Iraq she exposed both Mr. Biden's change of heart on the war, and his change of heart on Mr. Obama's views on the war. At times Mr. Biden even looked a little frustrated -- as if he couldn't quite believe he had to share the stage with someone who hasn't hung out with Dick Lugar or . . . Mike Mansfield back when the Senate was still a civil place. Or someone who says 'doggonit.'" (Editorial, "Free Sarah Palin," 
, 10/3/08) 
 
 
 "Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. appeared to incorrectly outline the constitutional role of the job he's seeking in Thursday's debate. In attacking Vice President Dick Cheney, Mr. Biden said the vice president's only role is to support the president and to preside over the Senate 'only in a time when in fact there's a tie vote. The Constitution is explicit.' The Constitution, though, actually says the vice president is always president of the Senate and legal scholars say he has the right to preside at any time. Early vice presidents, such as Thomas Jefferson, actively exercised that role, the vice president still keeps offices at the Capitol, and scholars say it wasn't until the middle of the 20th century that the vice president had an office at the executive office building."
