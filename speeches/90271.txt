The Democrats head into this week's debate in South Carolina with Hillary Clinton holding a consistent lead in the Democratic primary. In the four latest state polls, Clinton leads Barack Obama, South Carolina-born John Edwards, and the rest of the field.
And in those polls that released results among African-Americans (who make up half of the South Carolina Democratic primary electorate), Hillary Clinton has an even bigger lead among these voters.
Both the NEA poll and the Zogby poll also show that those who support Hillary Clinton say they support her more strongly and are less likely to change their minds than those who support the other candidates.
