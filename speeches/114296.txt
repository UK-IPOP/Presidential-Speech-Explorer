 "Why are so many in the media more concerned about Mitt Romney's criticism of a statement issued by the Cairo embassy on Tuesday than about the President's actual handling of this crisis? Well, we know the answer to the last question. As for the others, maybe the national media will stop piling on Romney long enough to find the answers." (

 "'Mitt Romney's a challenger, and he has every right to criticize that horrendous statement made by our embassy in Egypt.
