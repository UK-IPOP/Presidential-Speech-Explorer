This week, President Biden signed into law the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of 2022, bipartisan legislation passed by Congress as part of the Omnibus appropriations package.
One of the driving forces of President Biden's career has been fighting back against abuses of power. As a U.S. Senator President Biden championed the groundbreaking Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), landmark legislation that first passed in 1994. In the nearly three decades since, he has worked with Members of Congress from both parties to pass legislation to renew and strengthen VAWA.
In addition, yesterday President Biden delivered remarks at an event celebrating the bill's reauthorization. The President remarked "this reauthorization is testament to the power of your voices and your tireless dedication to changing things for the better."
Community leaders and elected officials applauded the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.
"Proud to join the President at the White House today as he signed #VAWA to protect and support survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault. As part of this bill, my years-long push to get survivors the care they need will finally become law."

"On behalf of the victims, survivors and advocates we represent, we applaud Congress for centering the needs of survivors by reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act with key enhancements in the omnibus appropriations bill. These updates to VAWA increase access to life-saving services, invest in prevention and improve the responsiveness of systems to the needs of survivors. This VAWA reauthorization recognizes that every survivor is unique with different needs and lived experiences and seeks to address survivors' needs holistically." [

"Today, President Biden signed the fiscal year 2022 omnibus appropriations bill, which included the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) Reauthorization of 2022 and much-needed funding increases for domestic violence programs. First enacted in 1994, VAWA creates and supports comprehensive, cost-effective responses to domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking. The National Network to End Domestic Violence (NNEDV) and our 56 member U.S. state and territorial domestic violence coalitions celebrate the reauthorization of VAWA and the signing of the fiscal year 2022 omnibus spending package. President Biden has a legacy of over 25 years of leadership advancing survivors rights in our nation. NNEDV is deeply grateful to the President and to the Senate and House VAWA Reauthorization bill lead sponsors Senators Feinstein (D-CA), Ernst (R-IA), Durbin (D-IL), Murkowski (R-AK), and Representatives Jackson Lee (D-TX), Fitzpatrick (R-PA), and Nadler (D-NY)" [

"I was so honored to be just a few feet from the President when he said:
"It wasn't so long ago this country didn't want to talk about violence against women. As a society, we looked away… This law broke the dam of congressional resistance and cultural resistance… No one, no one, regardless of gender or sexual orientation should experience abuse, period. And if they do, they should have the services and support they need to get through it... All of you should be enormously proud of what you've accomplished. This reauthorization is testament to the power of your voices and your tireless dedication to changing things for the better." He is right! This law will mean our country does more to support survivors, to prevent teen dating violence, sexual assault and rape, to stop online harassment and other predatory behaviors, and to end violence against women and children of every kind. Because the Violence Against Women Act was reauthorized, our families and our communities will be safer." [Statement 03/16/22]
"In supporting the reauthorization, President Biden continued what has been his decades-long example of being an accountable male ally for gender equality. On Wednesday I had the honor of being at the White House ceremony where the President acknowledged the many women's rights activists who made the legislation possible. He also put his finger on the heart of the issue: the power of some men over women, and the inaction of too many men in the face of men's violence against women." [Statement 03/16/22]
"Thank you, President for your steadfast commitment to #VAWA4ALL Grateful to you and your tremendous and committed staff for helping us get #VAWA across the finish line." [
