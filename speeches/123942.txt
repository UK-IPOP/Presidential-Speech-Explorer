After listening to Marco Rubio yesterday, I am convinced he is the right choice to lead our party into the general election. Marco bridges the gap between older voters and the next generation. I've never seen so many 18 year olds from Myrtle Beach High School so fired up about a Republican presidential candidate. Their excitement stems from Marco's talent for communicating our shared conservative principles in a manner that connects with voters on a human level. 
Huge crowd waiting on 
 here in Simpsonville!
