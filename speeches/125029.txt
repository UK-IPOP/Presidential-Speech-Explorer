Tonight is the fifth and final debate of 2015. It's yet another key moment for our campaign. Marco's emerged from the first four debates the clear winner, and we expect big things from him again tonight.
Despite the tone of the election season so far, Marco has succeeded by running a positive campaign. But don't be surprised if other candidates on the stage tonight get desperate and go on the attack.
That's not what Marco is there to do tonight. Of course, he will draw on his exceptionally strong record and contrast it with other candidates if he has to:
how he has a record of not just opposing ObamaCare but actually landing a significant blow against the law by blocking President Obama's attempted bailout
how he has offered a clear, strong vision for the United States' role in the world  in the 21st Century, which means standing up to Islamic terrorism 
 terrorist regimes
how he's fought to keep Americans safe at home, by keeping our intelligence programs strong and funding our military at the level it needs
how he has a detailed agenda to revive our economy here at home, through reforming taxes, regulation, health care, labor rules, and energy policy
That's the conservative record and vision you'll hear him talking about tonight. Debate viewers, and the thousands who've seen him on the campaign trail just this month, have liked what they've heard so far.
