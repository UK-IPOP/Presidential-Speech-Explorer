Just a heads up. Travel pool is at Ft McNair, leaving for the Delaware Air National Guard base at New Castle on an Osprey. That will position us for POTUS’ arrival from the White House scheduled later this afternoon. Stay glued to your in town pool feed for the departure and I will take the baton.
Marine One landed at the Air National Guard base in New Castle just before 7:00 pm.
POTUS disembarked immediately. He gave a little wave but got in a black SUV without coming over to take questions from pool. Seeking info on who was traveling with Biden.
Motorcade rolling at 7:01 pm.
The White House says traveling with the President were:
Steve Ricchetti
Annie Tomasini
Stephen Goepfert
Jonathan Cedarbaum
Kevin Munoz
 
He was met at the base by: by Lt. Col. Jason Brugman, Commander of the 166th Mission Support Group
At 7:16 pm POTUS motorcade peeled off into his residence in Greenville, DE. Pool could not see him.
