Romney for President today announced the support of veterans in South Carolina:
"I am proud to receive the endorsement of these South Carolina veterans who have selflessly and bravely fought to keep our nation safe and defend our American way of life," said Mitt Romney. "We must continue to support all of those who have served our nation as we work to preserve those very freedoms that our veterans and troops have fought to defend."
"Mitt Romney has been a strong advocate for veterans and will work to ensure that those who have heroically sacrificed for our country receive the care that they deserve," said Lt. General Bud Watts, former President of the Citadel. "We need a Commander-in-Chief who will support our veterans and troops, strengthen our military, and strengthen our national defense. Mitt Romney believes in America and in the founding principles that make our country great, and he is the kind of steadfast leader we need during these challenging times."
