The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced the campaign's Illinois Delegate Slate and Alternates throughout the state. These delegate candidates will represent Mayor Giuliani in the Illinois Republican primary election.
"Mayor Giuliani's recent successful trip to Chicago and DuPage County demonstrated he is the strongest Republican candidate in Illinois and our best chance in the general election," said Giuliani's State Campaign Chairman Tom Cross. "He is extremely excited to release this impressive delegate slate, which includes many respected leaders across the state."
The Mayor will visit Chicago on Thursday.
