Hello again from Wilmington — Pool is waiting near the Biden residence for departure.
We seem to be running behind sched, but don't have any updates on timing.
FYI due to a bad weather call, POTUS is going to be taking AF1 back to DC.
Press bus joined the POTUS motorcade at 9:30 am.
We are rolling to DANG.
Motorcade arrived at DANG at 9:37 am.
Biden boarded AF1 at 9:39 am, as pool was still getting out of the press bus. He waved at the top.
He didn't stop to take questions.
Wheels up momentarily.
AF1 landed at JBA at 10:12 am. (Sorry for slight delay in sending — took a few mins to get cell service back around small AF1)
POTUS deplaned at 10:20 am. He didn't stop for questions.
He boarded Marine One at 10:21 am. M1 lifted off at 10:27 am.
Handing off to in-town pool.
For some reason, this email from the WH just came through for me an hour later. But for those interested:
Steve Ricchetti, Assistant to the President and Counselor to the President
Terry Wolff, Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for MENA
