 "'I think the thing that really teed off a lot of firefighters was that nobody was polled about that,' said David Powell, a nonunion member who serves as chief of the all-volunteer Reedley Fire Department. 'The members were not asked about it.'" (Michael Doyle, "Union's Support Ignites Firefight," Fresno Bee, 8/8/04)

 "Some of the video's assertions are at the very least subject to debate. There is no dispute, for instance, that there were communications failures on Sept. 11. But the video highlights the hand-held radios, whereas the central problem, most experts agree, was the failure of a device meant to boost the signal so that it could reach the high floors of the towers. The video also implies that Mr. Giuliani was more concerned about securing some $200 million in gold stored in a basement vault at the World Trade Center than in recovering the remains of the dead, an accusation widely dismissed by people who closely monitored the cleanup." (Marc Santora, "Video By Firefighters' Union Urges Opposition To Giuliani," The New York Times, 7/12/07)
 "When a firefighters' union resorts to deceitful political stunts, it squanders the respect and credibility its members have sacrificed so much to earn. Which is why firefighters, more than anyone, ought to be livid over their national union's shamelessly mendacious new video skewering former Mayor Rudy Giuliani for his handling of the attack on the World Trade Center." (Editorial, "Union's Rudy Smear," The New York Post, 7/15/07)
 "New York's Bravest, and their leaders, have also had differences with Giuliani on a host of non-9/11 issues … But none of this excuses the blatant lies in the video released last week by the International Association of Fire Fighters. The flick all but holds Rudy responsible for the attacks themselves." (Editorial, "Union's Rudy Smear," The New York Post, 7/15/07)
 "What's the union's beef, specifically? It calls the idea that Giuliani provided leadership during the crisis an 'urban legend.' And says because of him, firefighters' radios didn't work and human remains were left in the debris. These are vicious falsehoods, of course. Which is why Lee Ielpi, a former firefighter whose son died in the attack, and former Office of Emergency Management Commissioner Richard Sheirer, called the film a 'disgrace.' 'I was there. I saw it,' said Ielpi, who worked at the cleanup at Ground Zero. 'I'm not going to let lies like this go.'" (Editorial, "Union's Rudy Smear," The New York Post, 7/15/07)
 "Here's the bottom line: On 9/11, New York was a safe, secure, well-run place – one that had been turned around, miraculously, from the chaotic, virtually lawless climate that prevailed before Giuliani took office. Indeed, the restoration of order and renewed investment in the city helped Gotham withstand the attack in 2001 and spring back quickly." (Editorial, "Union's Rudy Smear," The New York Post, 7/15/07)
 Not just for conveying confidence and calm, but also for assuring a smooth continuation of city government, despite huge obstacles. And, of course, for running the most complex rescue, recovery and clean-up operation in U.S. history." (Editorial, "Union's Rudy Smear," The New York Post, 7/15/07)
 "No one should be surprised that the IAFF is looking to impeach the integrity of a leading Republican presidential candidate. It has a record of supporting Democrats, like John Kerry and Hillary Rodham Clinton. Count on the union's endorsement of a Democrat for president next year. But that's a pathetic reason to distort the truth and rewrite the facts about a sacred period in U.S. history. IAFF leaders owe it to their fallen brothers at least to be honest about that awful day." (Editorial, "Union's Rudy Smear," The New York Post, 7/15/07)

 "[T]he video goes too far when it implies that bad radio communication was the only reason that 121 firefighters failed to clear the North Tower of the Trade Center after the first tower collapsed. To the contrary, the 9/11 Commission stated in its final report that the technical failure of fire department radios 'was not the primary cause of the many firefighter fatalities in the North Tower.'"

 "Nobody can say how many firefighters in the North Tower received the evacuation order and how many didn't. But, contrary to the impression left by the video, a number of firefighters did hear the orders on their radios. According to the 9/11 Commission, 'at least 24 of the at most 32 companies who were dispatched to and actually in the North Tower received the evacuation instruction – either via radio or directly from other first responders.'" (Brooks Jackson, et al, "Firefighters Vs. Giuliani," Annenberg Political Fact Check, 
, 7/18/07)
 "Other aspects of the video are misleading, including: an allegation that Giuliani 'blamed the victims' for not following evacuation orders, when his comments were in response to a question about heroism on 9/11; a statement that Giuliani pulled firefighters off recovery efforts, when he had reduced, not eliminated, the number of workers; a claim that Giuliani had protesting firefighters arrested, when arrests were minimal and most charges were dropped, as requested by the mayor." (Brooks Jackson, et al, "Firefighters Vs. Giuliani," Annenberg Political Fact Check, 
, 7/18/07)
 "The video also states that when firefighters protested the move, 'Giuliani had them arrested.' This is false. When New York City firefighters staged a protest on Nov. 3, 2001, only 18 people were arrested, according to news reports, and not by mayoral decree. In fact, about a week later, Giuliani announced that the city would drop the harassment and criminal trespass charges against 17 of the protesters. One man was charged with assault for allegedly hitting a police officer. That charge was not dropped." (Brooks Jackson, et al, "Firefighters Vs. Giuliani," Annenberg Political Fact Check, 
, 7/18/07)
 "Giuliani brushed off the video as a partisan smear. … Giuliani has a point here. In fact, records show the IAFF leans heavily Democratic. The union endorsed Democratic candidates Al Gore and John Kerry for president in 2000 and 2004, respectively. The IAFF's political action committee spending has favored Democrats by nearly 4 to 1 during each of the past two election cycles." (Brooks Jackson, et al, "Firefighters Vs. Giuliani," Annenberg Political Fact Check,

 After a terrible fire killed two firefighters shortly after he took office, Mayor Giuliani directed the FDNY to purchase and outfit every firefighter with new, state-of the-art protective bunker gear. By the end of his first year in office, the City had distributed 11,300 sets of bunker gear at a cost of approximately $10 million. The new bunker gear resulted in a decrease of burn injuries by nearly 60% between 1994 and 1996.

 To reduce heat stress at the fire scene, FDNY provided relief units faster than had previously been done. Recuperation and Care units, equipped with ice, water, fruit drinks, cold towels and misting fans to provide relief and hydration at the fire scene, responded to numerous fires. (FDNY, "With New York Firefighters," 4th Issue, 2001, p. 17)
 Giuliani Administration purchased thermal-imaging cameras for all FDNY Ladder Companies, allowing firefighters to see into smoke-filled spaces, locate victims more quickly, and detect hidden pockets of fires in walls and ceilings. (Mayor's State of the City Address, Jan 13, 2000; FDNY, "With New York Firefighters," 4th Issue, 2001, p. 9)
 In 1998, FDNY purchased Personal Alert Safety System (PASS) alarms for all firefighters to assist in the search and rescue of immobile/unconscious firefighters. The PASS alarms are integrated with the self-contained breathing apparatus, activating the alarm any time the air pack was in use so that firefighters no longer had to worry about activating their PASS in the middle of a fire response.

 The new exams, tailored to the unique risk factors that firefighters face, are much more comprehensive and thorough. (FDNY, "With New York Firefighters," 4th Issue, 2001, p. 18)
 Capital spending for the Fire Department under the Giuliani administration rose to an average of $120 million a year for eight years. This was a substantial increase over the $21 million a year for four years spent by the previous administration. (FDNY, "With New York Firefighters," 4th Issue, 2001, Pg 25)

 FDNY established the Special Operations Command Battalion in 1998 to oversee the role of specialized units at incidents concerning hazardous materials, chemical/biological threats, confined space operations and high-angle rope rescue. The Special Operations Command Battalion is responsible for five Rescue Companies, seven Squad Companies, three Marine Units, and one Haz-Mat unit, as well as the Tactical Support, De-Watering, De-Con, and Recuperation and Care (RAC) units. (FDNY, "With New York Firefighters," 4th Issue, 2001, p. 9)
 In 1998, FDNY designated five Engine Companies as Squad Companies, bringing the total number of squads under the Special Operations Command to seven. The Squad Companies, which had to undergo special training, can go into action as either an Engine or Ladder Company, and received intensive training in Ladder Company operations, Haz-Mat mitigation and decontamination procedures, as well as a variety of rescue skills. (FDNY, "With New York Firefighters," 4th Issue, 2001, p. 9)
 Mayor Giuliani and the FDNY created and placed Auxiliary Rescue Craft in service within the Marine Division in 1996. These two firefighting/rescue boats patrol the waterways between May and October, and immediately accounted for many water rescues, which resulted in more craft being ordered by the FDNY.

 "'New York City is the Cadillac of preparedness. On a scale of one to 10, I'd give them a 9.5,' [Michael Wermuth, senior policy analyst at RAND Corp.] said.

 "In a bid to improve the city's disaster planning and response, Mayor Giuliani [1/16/96] created a new Office of Emergency Management with a … director.

 Giuliani: "We try every day every month every year to improve and we — we're doing more about the possibility of attack than we've ever done before. I've established a couple of years ago an office of emergency management which the city never had before … They have gone through table top exercises, actual drills. We've worked with the Defense Department — worked with foreign agencies. We're trying to improve everyday our ability to react and to detect and we have – - I think the only joint anti-terrorism force in the country where the police and the FBI agents work together as partners to try to sift through this information."
