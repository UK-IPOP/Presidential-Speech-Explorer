Mitt Romney today announced members of his West Virginia Steering Committee.
"I am honored to have the support of so many West Virginia leaders," said Mitt Romney. While every state's economy is suffering under President Obama, West Virginia's is one of the few under active attack by Obama. As president, I will make domestic energy production a critical priority for our economic recovery. West Virginia's coal resources are a tremendous asset to the state and to the nation and I will encourage their development."
State Senator Donna J. Boley announcing her support said, "President Obama's attempts to restart our economy for the last three years have failed. His liberal, over-reaching policies are simply not working. We need a conservative, experienced leader who understands how the economy works and has actually created jobs. As Governor, Mitt Romney balanced the budget without raising taxes. He spent 25 years in the private sector turning around failing businesses and successfully turned around the 2002 Olympic Winter Games. I am proud and excited to support Mitt Romney for President." Boley is a veteran Legislator and former WV Republican National Committeewoman.
Bill Phillips will lead the Romney WV Team.  Serving as Co-Chairs will be Donna Gosney, Republican National Committeewoman; Delegate Bob Ashley, a member of the WV Legislature; Thomas O'Neill, Vice Chairman of the WV Republican Party; Wendy McCuskey, Romney State Director in 2008; and Senator Boley.
John H. McCutcheon, II, a senior advisor to Governor Romney in 2008 and State Bush Director in 2000, will assist Phillips who directed the 2000 Bush presidential campaign in WV.
