Proud to endorse

I am proud to support Marco Rubio, a strong fiscal conservative and living testament to the American Dream.

The son of a bartender and a maid, Marco has seen firsthand how American families and workers can thrive when the shackles of government are removed. Washington's pattern of borrowing and spending its way out of problems has failed to expand opportunity for working families, preventing many parents from providing their children with a better future as Marco's parents did for him. Marco is committed to expanding jobs and opportunity for all Americans, and he has successfully chipped away at Obamacare and consistently fought back against burdensome regulations that are crippling businesses from hiring more workers and increasing wages. Under Marco's leadership, all American families will know that their best days lie ahead.
Rubio bags the endorsement of Club for Growth's former president, Chris Chocola. The current regime likes him too.
