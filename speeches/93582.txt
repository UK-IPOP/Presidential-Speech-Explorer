 George Will: "[T]he wisdom of New York was to be Mayor of New York … That it was impossible to govern the city. … When I say that being mayor of New York is demanding, I mean this. It has more people than do 39 other states. It is more difficult to govern than all 50 of the states. This for a reason — New York City has been liberalism's laboratory in the 20th century, which means it is a seriously troubled place, or was. It produced a culture of complaint, which led to the politics of victimhood, which led to government by grievance groups, and the learned dependency of an over-developed welfare state."

 "Of all the problems Giuliani will face, none will loom larger – or sooner – than the question of what to do about the city's finances. Under a tough law passed after the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970s, he will be required to explain in January how he plans to close the gap in the current year's budget, estimated at about $400 million [and growing]. Soon after, he will be required to come up with the outline of his budget for the fiscal year starting next summer, which currently contains a projected $1.5-billion deficit [and growing]."

 "Giuliani will step into a crisis when he takes office in January. The city's revenues for the fiscal year ending next June 30 are projected to run $500 million below outlays. And powerful unions will resist Giuliani's campaign pledge to slash 35,000 city jobs to close the gap. Meanwhile, the mayor-elect says, New York City's high taxes and suffocating regulations have spurred a business exodus that has contributed to the loss of about 400,000 private-sector jobs in four years."
