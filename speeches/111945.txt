"President Obama's campaign is willing to say anything to cover up for the President's years of broken promises and job-destroying policies. President Obama would love to have Mitt Romney's record of job creation and economic growth. Instead, he's stuck defending an unemployment rate that has failed to meet his own goal of 6% and an economy that's stuck in neutral. If President Obama had even half of Mitt Romney's record on jobs and the economy, he'd be running on it." â€“ Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
