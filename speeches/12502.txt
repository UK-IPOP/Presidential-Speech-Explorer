 more than ten thousand lives are lost each year as a result of fires in the United States: and
 the property loss from fires in the United States in 1936 was more than $260,000,000, a marked increase over the loss in 1935; and
 this upward trend in the devastation wrought by fires can be corrected only through the earnest effort of everyone; and
 it has been customary for the President of the United States to request public observance of Fire Prevention Week in an effort to bring home to every citizen a realization of individual responsibility in the movement to curtail losses of life and property from preventable fires;
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim and designate the week beginning October 3, 1937, as Fire Prevention Week and invite the active cooperation of all our people in the elimination of fire hazards and the prevention of fire waste, to the end that human life may be safeguarded and the national prosperity increased.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 18th day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-second.
