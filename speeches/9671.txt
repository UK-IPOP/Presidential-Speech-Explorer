I AM GRATEFUL for the measure adopted by the Massachusetts Republican State Convention. I deeply appreciate your support. We have now entered a period of the campaign when every energy needs to be put forward to bring to the people an understanding of the principles and purposes of the Republican party. We have before us great problems, we have initiated and are carrying forward sound and effective measures. Our programs and policies are already demonstrating their validity. The real program of our opponents is clear--it is evidenced by the measures passed by the last House of Representatives under Democratic control and it is your duty to bring the knowledge of such disastrous efforts before the people. I have no doubt of your success.
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Amos Taylor, Chairman, State Committee, c/o Republican State Convention, Boston, Massachusetts]
