Pool Reports by 
, 
Good morning! Pool is held up at a park near Biden's house at 10:30, waiting to be swept. I'll send updates as I receive them.
Pool is positioned near a bike trail, waiting for the President.
Biden rode by on his bike, surrounded by secret service agents and joined by FLOTUS, on the trail at 11:35. He did not respond to shouted questions about calling Macron.
The President rode by again with FLOTUS at 12:16, as watchers cheered and drowned out a reporter's question about Macron.
Lid was called at 1:25.
