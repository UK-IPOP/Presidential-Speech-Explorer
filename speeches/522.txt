In compliance with a resolution of the Senate of the 18th instant, I transmit a report * from the Secretary of State, with the papers therewith presented. Not having accurate and detailed information of the civil, military, and political condition of Texas, I have deemed it expedient to take the necessary measures, now in progress, to procure it before deciding upon the course to be pursued in relation to the newly declared government.
ANDREW JACKSON
