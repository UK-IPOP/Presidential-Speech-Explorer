The Washington Times Wrongly Claims National Guard Troops Being Withdrawn "Earlier Than Promised"
 
 (Jerry Seper, "Guard Troops Pulled Back From Border," 
, 8/9/07)
 THE PRESIDENT:"This initial commitment of Guard members would last for a period of one year. After that, the number of Guard forces will be reduced as new Border Patrol agents and new technologies come online." (President George W. Bush, Address To The Nation On Immigration Reform, Washington, DC, 5/15/06)
 These National Guard members are not involved in direct law enforcement activities; instead, they are providing help with surveillance, construction, and logistics. Their support has allowed the Border Patrol to move more than 500 agents to the front line from administrative support positions.
 In addition, to continue enabling Border Patrol agents to work in the field rather than behind a desk, the Department of Homeland Security is spending about $40 million on 536 administrative support personnel in FY 2007 and is requesting $49.3 million in FY 2008 to support 688 administrative support personnel for the Border Patrol.
 The Border Patrol now has more than 14,000 agents serving today – up from 9,000 in 2001 – and is on track to add roughly 600 more agents by September 30. The Administration expects to add 3,000 agents in Fiscal Year 2008, doubling the size of the Border Patrol to 18,000 agents since the President took office.
 In addition, today there are in place:
 The number of other-than-Mexican alien apprehensions is down 48 percent. This is a result of the success of Operation Jump Start as well as implementing catch and return, increased worksite enforcement, and continued prosecutions of smugglers and criminals who try enter the country illegally.
