WE WHO WORK in the government want to assume our full citizens' share of voluntary support of the many worthwhile private health and welfare organizations.
True voluntary giving is based on the personal desire of an individual to make a private donation to a specific agency for a purpose with which he is familiar and which he wants to support.
The new program will make available to everyone in the government the opportunity to give his full measure of support to these efforts.
