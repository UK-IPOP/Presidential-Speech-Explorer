 the XVIth Olympic Games of the modern era will be held in Melbourne, Australia, beginning November 22 and ending December 8, 1956; and
 these games afford an opportunity for the finest men and women athletes from more than seventy participating countries to assemble together in an atmosphere of friendly competition and good sportsmanship; and
 these athletes, who represent different nations, creeds, and race's, meet together in competitive tests of their athletic abilities under rules and conditions which offer equality of opportunity for all; and
 experience has shown that contestants and spectators have returned to their homes from Olympic Games not only refreshed in their friendships and richer in their understanding of other peoples, but also with new insight into the brotherhood of man; and
 in these times of international tensions the peoples of the world need the stabilizing influence of the friendly relations, wholesome competition, and high ideals of sportsmanship engendered by the Olympic Games; and
 the United States Olympic Association is presently engaged in assuring maximum support for the team representing the United States at Melbourne:
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Saturday, October 27, 1956, as National Olympic Day; and I urge the fullest possible participation in its observance by people throughout the United States.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-sixth day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-first.

DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:

JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
