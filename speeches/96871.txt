 Yesterday, Mrs. Bush joined Members of Congress to announce the formation of the Congressional Malaria Caucus to combat this preventable disease. Today, President Bush signed a Presidential Proclamation in honor of Malaria Awareness Day. He then traveled to Hartford, Connecticut to visit the Northwest Boys & Girls Club and present the Dragonfly Awards. First presented by Mrs. Bush during the 2006 White House Summit on Malaria, the Dragonfly Awards promote awareness of malaria by recognizing the efforts of young people who have completed substantial projects focused on the prevention or treatment of malaria. President Bush presented this award to three leaders in the fight against malaria:
 At least one million infants and children under age five in Sub-Saharan Africa die each year from malaria – one approximately every 30 seconds. This February, President and Mrs. Bush traveled to Africa to see firsthand the incredible progress against malaria as a result of PMI.
 For example, in partnership with Malaria No More and others, PMI was able to distribute 590,000 nets in Uganda.
 Last summer, nations of the G-8 matched the United States' commitment by pledging to cut malaria deaths by half in an additional 15 countries – G-8 nations should take action on these promises.
 This summit brought together international experts, multilateral institutions, corporations and foundations, African civic leaders, NGOs, and faith-based and service organizations to discuss and highlight measures for controlling malaria.
 In 2007, the President requested that Congress double our original funding commitment for this successful program to $30 billion over five years.
