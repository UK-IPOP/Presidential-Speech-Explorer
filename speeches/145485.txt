Some clearer transcription of POTUS' responses from first email.
Q on china and russia's relationship
"There's nothing new about that."
Q on Putin's decision making
"I think things he cannot get."
Not included in first report, Biden was asked "Any message to the troops and their families in Poland?"
POTUS stopped pumped his fist as in a sign of support, it appears he said something but it was inaudible to poolers even after multiple playbacks given helicopter noise and his distance from mics at that point.
