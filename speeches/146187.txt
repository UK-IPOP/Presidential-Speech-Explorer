Presidential Determination on the Proposed Agreement between the Government of the United States of America, the Government of Australia, and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the Exchange of Naval Nuclear Propulsion Information
I have reviewed and concur in the positions taken in your memorandum of November 15, 2021, recommending approval of a proposed Agreement between the Government of the United States of America, the Government of Australia, and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the Exchange of Naval Nuclear Propulsion Information (the "Agreement"). I note your recommendation and concur with your assessment that Australia and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, by participating with the United States pursuant to international arrangements, are making substantial and material contributions to the mutual defense and security. The Agreement will permit cooperation, which will further improve our mutual defense posture and support our interests under the North Atlantic Treaty; the Australia, New Zealand, and United States Security Treaty; and the enhanced trilateral security partnership among the three Parties known as "AUKUS."
I hereby approve the Agreement, determine that performance of the Agreement will promote and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to the common defense and security, and authorize the execution of the Agreement by the United States Government in a manner specified by the Secretary of State.
JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.
