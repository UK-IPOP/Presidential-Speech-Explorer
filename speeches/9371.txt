It was announced at the White House today that the President has appointed a committee to make a careful study of the relation of the Emergency Agencies to the regular organizations of the Executive branch of the Government.
Louis Brownlow of Washington was named chairman of this committee with Charles E. Merriam of Chicago and Luther Gulick of New York as the other members. This committee will serve as an adjunct of the National Emergency Council which will provide the necessary office facilities and such personnel as the committee may require.
The President requested that the new committee present its report to him in time for submission to the 75th Congress of such recommendations as may be based on the report.
The White House also made public a letter from the President to the Vice President asking the Senate to cooperate with the President and with the new committee through a special committee which the Senate has already established to consider certain aspects of the same problem.
A letter from the President to the Speaker of the House was made public at the same time. This letter asks the House to create a committee of a similar character through which the House can cooperate with the President and with the committee just established. There follow the texts of the President's letters to the Vice President and to the Speaker. The letters are identical except for their last paragraphs.
