Mr. President, members of your party, ladies and gentlemen:
I wish to express on behalf of the people of the United States our great satisfaction in welcoming you to our country.
This is the first occasion in the history of the Sudan that a leader of your country has come to visit the United States and we're particularly glad that this should happen in this most significant year of 1961.
Your flag, like the flag of the United States, tells us a good deal about your country. The blue for the Nile River, the yellow for the desert, the green for what you have been able to do with the combination of the desert and the Nile.
We welcome you also because you have set an example of a country with eight. neighbors, all of whom live at peace with you and with each other. You have set a standard for your continent and indeed in that sense for the world.
So, Mr. President, we welcome you to Washington. We are extremely happy that you will visit the United States, that you will see something of our country and something of our people. We are a young country. You are the leader of a country which is even younger, but in a very real sense is perhaps the oldest part of the known world.
So for many reasons, Mr. President, we welcome you here. We value the fact that you have chosen to visit us. We want you to know that your Ministers and yourself will be most welcome, and we hope that when you depart you will carry with you a very real appreciation of the warm feeling of friendship that our country feels for yours.
