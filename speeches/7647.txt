THE NEWS of your successful flight thrills the people of the entire American nation and upon their behalf and my own I send to you and your gallant companion Monsieur Maurice Bellonte our heartiest congratulations. We shall delight to honor the heroic compatriots of those other brave Frenchmen whose undaunted efforts foreshadowed this triumph. Our people's welcome to you is wholehearted and universal.
HERBERT HOOVER
