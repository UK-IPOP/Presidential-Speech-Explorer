Dear Mr. and Mrs. Hoffman:
I learned only recently that yours is the only family with five sons currently on active duty in any of the military services, an experience unprecedented in the United States Marine Corps.

I am deeply impressed by this record. As you may know, each day I receive reports which indicate the bravery of our servicemen and which make me realize even more the magnitude of our debt to them.
This certainly applies to your fine sons who individually and collectively have demonstrated the highest degree of loyalty and dedication.

But just as I am proud of them, I also want to commend you for imparting to them a deep sense of patriotism and a full understanding of the responsibilities of citizenship.
As long as we have families such as the Hoffmans, I have not the slightest doubt that the liberty this nation has enjoyed for almost two hundred years will continue to be a birthright for future generations of Americans.
I wish you would express to each of your sons my appreciation, as well as that of the entire country, for the contributions they are making to the cause of free men everywhere.

Mrs. Johnson joins me in extending best wishes to all of the members of your courageous and devoted family.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Mr. and Mrs. Henry J. Hoffman, 92 Bingham Ave., Rumson, N.J.]
