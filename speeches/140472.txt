Joe Biden has pledged to rejoin the job-killing Paris Climate Accord on day one of entering the Oval Office, returning America to an era of subsidizing other countries, killing our jobs with onerous regulations, and putting America last!



Economists estimate that American households would spend between 15% and 20% more for their electricity under the accord.
It would kill 400,000 American jobs per year, including 200,000 manufacturing jobs.
The Paris Climate Accord would cost American families of four $30,000 per year, and cost the U.S. economy a shocking $2.5 trillion.

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris' plan to rejoin the Paris Climate Accord and impose their extreme climate agenda would cripple our economy with burdensome regulations. It would be exactly the wrong approach as our country recovers from the coronavirus pandemic, and it would certainly stop President Trump's Great American Comeback in its tracks.
