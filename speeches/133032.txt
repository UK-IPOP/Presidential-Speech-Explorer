 Thank you very much. It's a great honor to be with a friend of mine—Emmanuel, thank you very much—the President of France, who's doing a terrific job being President of France. He's changing a lot of things around. And I guess that had to happen. And it's—I think it's going to be very successful. We have a tremendous relationship. We're discussing trade. We're discussing NATO. We're discussing a lot of different things. And hopefully, in the end, it will all work out. And so it's great to be with you.

. Thank you, Donald.

 It sounded beautifully. [

 I have to say, I told them exactly the same—[

 That's right. That's right. Beautiful. It was beautiful.

 It was 13th and 14th of July. And we've worked together for—yes—12 months now.

 Sure.

 And took some great decisions. And——

 We've made some good decisions.

 And we'll continue to work together——

. That's right.

. ——on different issues.

 That's right. Thank you very much. Thank you.



President Macron, do you agree that Angela Merkel is beholden to the Russians?

 Oh, I'm glad they asked you that. [

Thank you. Thank you very much for asking him my question.

 No, I think——

No?

 We just discussed the nature of that. We work together.
