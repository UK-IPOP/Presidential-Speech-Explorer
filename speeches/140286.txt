President Trump just left Fort Bragg in North Carolina, where he met with Army special operations forces and presented the presidential unit citation to our heroes who conducted the successful raid against ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi one year ago this week. The President and First Lady also visited the special forces memorial and paid their respects.

President Trump's record of taking out dangerous terrorists and protecting American lives stands in stark contrast to the weakness of Joe Biden.
