The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced the launch of a new web video entitled "Some."

 to view the video. The script is below.
 "Some say we don't need a national catastrophe fund. That FEMA can handle disasters. Others say they haven't looked at it yet and want to sit down with insurance companies first. Only one Republican candidate has proven experience dealing with disaster. Only one will fight for a national catastrophe fund. And only one has a plan to lower rates and fix the insurance mess. Tested in crisis. Ready to lead. Rudy Giuliani. The only one for Florida."
 "I'm Rudy Giuliani and I approve this message."
