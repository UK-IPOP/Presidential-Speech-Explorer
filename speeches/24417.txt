Your Majesty:
On the happy occasion of the wedding of Princess Beatrix, Mrs. Johnson joins me in sending our very best wishes, and those of the American people. All my countrymen will share with our close friends of The Netherlands the pleasure of this important event in the life of your family and your great nation.

Mrs. Johnson and I recall with pleasure the hospitality you graciously extended to us when we last visited The Netherlands.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Her Majesty, The Queen of The Netherlands, Soestdijk, The Netherlands]
