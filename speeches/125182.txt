: "Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey had a standout performance."
: "My scoring, delivered on @NewDay w/ @ChrisCuomo and @AlisynCamerota: gold @ChrisChristie silver @JebBush bronze a tie @tedcruz @marcorubio"
: "Chris Christie won big...I want you to go home understanding that Ted Cruz and Chris Christie were the winners of this debate."
: "Chris Christie B+: As in the last debate, gave a commanding yet measured performance, standing out with a unique style and emphasis. Often addressed voters directly in an us-versus-them manner. Took advantage of the three squabbling senators to tout his executive experience without confronting any particular opponent head on. Confident, assertive, carefully non-abrasive, and driving towards his goal."
: "Chris Christie just made the GOP race a lot more interesting"
 "Chris Christie always does well in these debates, looking directly into the camera and speaking bluntly. He began with a great opening statement, discussing the bomb threat that suddenly closed every school in Los Angeles, and how the kids in those schools will feel tomorrow morning."
: "But overall he sounded confident positioning himself as someone who had personal experience on security and his argument might fit the post-Paris, post-San Bernardino times for GOP voters."
: "Chris Christie was at his best in Vegas, capping off a great month."
: "In one of his strongest moments, Christie slammed the senators on stage as "people who've never had to make a consequential decision in an executive position" and proclaimed that voters were looking for "a president who actually knows what they're doing."
: "At fifth GOP debate "most improved" award goes to Christie, bickering backfires"
: "You know, Christie was extremely forceful. He didn't really tangle with anyone. He just got his message across on every single answer. And Sean, importantly, brought it back at every single opportunity to Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton."
r: "And you know that's what Chris Christie does really well, is point out those kinds of eye rolling moments that people are really upset about."
: "He has this great ability to look straight down the camera and talk directly to the American people, and he had a lot of those moments tonight. So it was a good debate for him."
: "The other person who's taking it seriously is Chris Christie. Chris Christie came to fight -- I really really thought when he did the thing he does often, you know, scolding people. You guys are talking in ways that are not connecting with the American people. He's done it a bunch of times, but it was very effective tonight. Tonight when you had Rubio and Cruz going down the Senate rabbit hole."
 "Here we are with our panel of eight undecided Republicans, Republican leaning independents, we should say. They're all from the tri-state region here around New York... Who in your judgment had the best night tonight?"
 "I thought Christie was very clear."
: "I think Rubio and Christie did the best. and, just as important, I think people with low poll numbers didn't help themselves tonight.
 "Christie, I think helped himself tonight, I think Christie is a terror warrior and people got that impression."
: "Chris Christie did very well tonight. He's doing very well in New Hampshire."
: "Chris Christie has a path to win this New Hampshire primary. And if Chris Christie wins this New Hampshire primary, if he gets to go forward, he's a formidable politician; he's a gifted communicator."
