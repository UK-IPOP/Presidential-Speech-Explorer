SANTA FE, NM -- Today, Governor Bill Richardson issued the following statement commemorating America's brave men and women veterans.
"Memorial Day is a time to thank those that have served and sacrificed for our country," said Governor Bill Richardson. "Military service is one of most noble acts an individual can perform and we have an obligation and duty to support those that risk their lives for our country. In New Mexico, we have a proud tradition of answering the call to serve our nation and as Governor I have made it a top priority to return that support by ensuring that those serving in our U.S. military and their families are provided financial assistance and access to benefits they so deserve."
As an international diplomat, Bill Richardson throughout his career in public service has shown a commitment to championing the issues of our national veterans and military personnel.
Most recently, in April of this year, Governor Richardson led a diplomatic mission to North Korea that successfully returned the remains of six U.S. soldiers killed during the Korean War.
