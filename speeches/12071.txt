 it appears that it would be in the public interest to include within and reserve as part of the Ocala National Forest, in the State of Florida, certain forest lands which have been or may be acquired under the authority of the act of Congress approved March 1, 1911, 36 Stat. 961 (U.S.C., title 16, sec. 516), as amended by the act of June 7, 1924, 43 Stat. 653 (U.S.C., title 16, sec. 515), and certain intermingled public lands:
 President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the power vested in me by section 24 of the act of March 3, 1891, 26 Stat. 1103 (U.S.C., title 16, sec. 471), the act of June 4, 1897, 30 Stat. 34, 36 (U.S.C., title 16, sec. 473), and section 11 of the act of March 1, 1911, 36 Stat. 963 (U.S.C., title 16, sec. 521), do proclaim that there are hereby included in and reserved as part of the Ocala National Forest, in the State of Florida, all lands of the United States within the areas shown on the diagram attached hereto and made a part hereof, and that all lands therein which may hereafter be acquired by the United States under the said act of March 1, 1911, as amended by the said act of June 7, 1924, shall upon their acquisition be reserved and administered as part of the said national forest.
The reservation made by this proclamation shall as to all lands which are at this date legally appropriated under the public-land laws or reserved for any public purpose other than for classification under Executive Order No. 6964 of February 5, 1935, as amended, be subject to, and shall not interfere with or defeat, legal rights under such appropriation, nor prevent the use for such public purpose of lands so reserved, so long as such appropriation is legally maintained or such reservation remains in force.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington, this 16" day of July in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-third.
