Memorandum for Chairman Macy:
I found your report on the operation of the new Executive Seminar Center both interesting and encouraging. I congratulate you, your Civil Service Commission colleagues, and all who have worked to make this unusual interagency experiment in career development the success that it has been.
I am pleased by your report that the Center is making significant contributions to the excellence in the public service for which we strive. I am also pleased to find that the Center draws on the intellectual resources of the academic, business, labor, and Government communities to enrich the trainees' educational experience and broaden their perspectives by exposing them to the divergent ideas, views, and approaches the varied visiting faculty brings to the seminars. I hope, and I have confidence, that the performance of seminar participants in the years ahead will bear out your observation.
It is important that you continue to emphasize to agencies the need to make careful selections of seminar participants. They should be sure to nominate not those who can most easily be spared, but those who ordinarily can't be--the men and women who show real potential for assignment to career positions of greatest responsibility. Only in this way will the Seminar Center fulfill its high promise.
I will watch with continuing interest the course of the Seminar Center. I will be particularly interested in hearing more of your plans for establishment of similar centers in other areas. Please keep me advised of future developments and progress.
