Hi, all,
As of 10:55 a.m. ET, President Trump has no public events listed on the available schedule, though the daily coronavirus task force on-camera press briefing at the White House is still scheduled for 5:00 p.m. ET today. I'll send along additional info. if/when that changes.
Out on the driveway earlier this a.m., Dr. Deborah Birx did a TV hit. Several reporters tried to ask her questions, ranging from Q's about the millions of newly uninsured Americans to her scarves, around 10:35 a.m. ET, but Dr. Birx did not stop to gaggle, with staff citing that she was late for a meeting.
I'm your print pooler for the day, so if you haven't been able to make it to the White House lately due to concerns/issues surrounding the virus, and if you have question(s) for the task force briefing later today, please feel free to message me directly, and I'll see if I can get to them. Thank you.
Everyone stay healthy out there.
At 12:27 p.m. ET today, the White House called a lunch lid until 2 p.m. ET.
Hi, all,
The daily coronavirus task force presser is still on the schedule for 5 p.m. ET today, in the White House briefing room. Below is a link to livestream the press briefing, once it starts. I'll send along any additional information or color or off-camera detail from the room, if warranted.
Thanks, all.
This was distributed to the briefing room as today's coronavirus task force press briefing began:
At 7:43 p.m. ET, the White House called a travel/photo lid. Apologies that I wasn't able to get to all of your submitted questions, re: the daily briefing, but I got in as many as I could.
To everyone, be healthy and safe and at least relatively happy out there. Take care, all.
