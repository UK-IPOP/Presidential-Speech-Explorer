Ladies and gentlemen:
As you will recall, during the last campaign I expressed a great interest in basic research and particularly in the field of science.
As you know, there has been considerable concern expressed in scientific circles and in educational circles with regard to the ceiling on expenditures for the National Science Foundation.
After a very vigorous discussion of this item, having in mind the fact that we have a difficult expenditure situation in the present budget, I have finally decided to authorize the Director of the Bureau of the Budget to raise the ceiling by an amount of $10 million. This is covered in the statement which you have before you.
Dr. DuBridge will indicate what this will mean. Also, I think, Doctor, if you could indicate why ,the imposition of the ceiling had such a detrimental effect not just on the scientific community, but on higher education generally.
Thank you very much.
