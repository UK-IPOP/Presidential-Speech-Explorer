 baited

So that's a "no" from Trump on whether he will bring his clothing companies back from Mexico and China. 


— Leon Wolf (@LeonHWolf) 
Trump still isn't actually answering the question about whether or not Trump collection clothes are made in Mexico

— Jessica Taylor (@JessicaTaylor) 
So Trump won't make clothes in U.S. B/c of devaluation — got it

Good answer here from Rubio. He's hitting Trump for saying that he, not the private sector, would create jobs.

Rubio is clearly under Trump's skin. Two hours of this, he might crack.
