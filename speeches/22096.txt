THE recommendations in this report should have the immediate attention of the Congress. Less than a month ago I said that if our society is to move higher, higher education must be made a universal opportunity for all young people. There is no more urgent need today than to provide the educational opportunities which will permit every young person to develop to his maximum potential. The report shows that this opportunity is not now available to many District high school graduates. The Nation's Capital, which should set an example for the Nation, has instead lagged behind.
I am asking the District Commissioners to prepare a draft of appropriate legislation for submission to the Congress. In the meantime, I commend the report for study by all interested groups.
