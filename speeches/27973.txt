Your Highness Prince Juan, Princess Sophia:
I welcome you, on behalf of all the people of the United States, very warmly to our country and to the Nation's Capital. I welcome you not only officially but personally.
Speaking officially for the people of the United States, we recall the great debt we owe to those courageous and daring Spanish explorers who came to the New World so many centuries ago.
We think of the heritage we owe to Spanish-speaking people in our Nation. We recall the fact, for example, that right at this time, next to English, more Americans speak Spanish than any other language. It is our second language.
We also think of the present, of the fact that we are partners in defense and that we also are partners in progress in our economic policies, partners in progress for the fastest growing economy of all the nations of Europe, the economy of your country.
And we think also of the future, of the vibrancy and the strength represented by the young people of your country of which you and your Princess are such distinguished representatives.
And speaking personally, Mrs. Nixon and I will never forget the welcome we received from the people of Spain in Madrid a few months ago.
You are welcomed just as warmly to our country, and we hope that your few days stay here will be as memorable for you as our stay in your country was memorable for us.
