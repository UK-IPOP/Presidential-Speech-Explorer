President Biden's economic plan to build from the bottom up and the middle out is working. America is getting back to work, and for the first time in decades, workers at the bottom are seeing the results. Since President Biden took office, there has been historic job growth – more than 3 million jobs created, and a monthly average of more than 600,000 new jobs – the most in any President's first five months.
The average number of new unemployment claims has been cut by more than half since President Biden took office, and in every metropolitan area across the country, unemployment has fallen compared to last year. Consumer confidence is now soaring and independent projections from the CBO, the IMF, the Federal Reserve, the World Bank, the OECD, and many others all forecast America this year reaching the highest levels of growth in nearly four decades. And recent data suggest that supply chain disruptions driving short-term price increases are beginning to resolve themselves.
Over the past week, we have seen continued evidence that President Biden's economic plan is working.
