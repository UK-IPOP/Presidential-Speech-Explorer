Joe Biden is falsely claiming the Senate's impending confirmation of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court is "unconstitutional." It's a laughable, pathetic accusation, and it 
.
"It's not unconstitutional," CNN's Jake Tapper said after Biden's deputy campaign manager failed to specify which part of the Constitution Republicans were violating. "There's nothing unconstitutional about what the U.S. Senate is doing."
 In 2016, Biden said that if he were chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he would see it as his constitutional duty to move forward with a Supreme Court nomination, even a few months before a presidential election:
In January 2017, Biden was asked if Democrats should refuse to go along with the confirmation process of a Supreme Court nominee selected by President Trump. Biden said no:
This Supreme Court vacancy has exposed Joe Biden as a shameless hypocrite who will say whatever he needs to say to help the radical left seize power. He has refused to come clean on his plans to rig the Supreme Court in the far left's favor if he were to win the White House, and he now is attacking as "unconstitutional" a process he himself was defending just a short time ago.
Biden has campaigned on the claim that he will always tell voters the truth. That's obviously malarkey.
