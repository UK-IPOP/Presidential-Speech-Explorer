ARLINGTON, VA -- Today, McCain-Palin 2008 campaign spokesman Ben Porritt released the following statement:
"By the time Barack Obama ran for the U.S. Senate, he had grown so close to ACORN that they were characterized as 'old friends.' In fact, when Obama first ran for the Illinois state senate, the head of ACORN in Chicago said it was 'natural' for ACORN employees to work on his campaign. Given ACORN's unlawful involvement in the presidential election, the American people deserve an honest and forthright explanation from Obama about the true nature of his relationship with the group." 
 "The latest wave of ACORN investigations has provided Republicans with both an opening to assail an old foe, and a new line of criticism to use against the Democratic presidential nominee, who represented ACORN in a lawsuit in the 1990s." (Alexander Burns, "ACORN Gives GOP New Line Of Attack,"

 "At the time, Talbot worked at the social action group ACORN and initially considered Obama a competitor. But she became so impressed with his work that she invited him to help train her staff." (Letta Tayler and Keith Herbert, "Obama Forged Path As Chicago Community Organizer," 
 , 3/2/08) 
 "Since then, we have invited Obama to our leadership training sessions to run the session on power every year, and, as a result, many of our newly developing leaders got to know him before he ever ran for office. Thus it was natural for many of us to be active volunteers in his first campaign for STate [sic] Senate and then his failed bid for U.S. Congress in 1996. By the time he ran for U.S. Senate, we were old friends." ("Barack Obama's Involvement with ACORN Unearthed, Missing Articles Recovered,"
