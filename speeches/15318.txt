GENERAL, it gives me a lot of pleasure, on behalf of the Cabinet, to present you with the seat that you have occupied as Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense with such great honor and credit to the Government of the United States, and as a great help to the President of the United States.
We all join in wishing you a happy continuation of your retirement, and I cannot guarantee that you will continue to be in retirement, as I have already robbed you of your time three or four times.
