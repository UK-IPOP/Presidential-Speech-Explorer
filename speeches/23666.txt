THIS IS the first time such a consortium has been used in United States aid programs in the field of education. I am delighted that these nine major centers of knowledge and learning have been willing to pool their resources, in cooperation with the Agency for International Development, to cooperate in the development of advanced education facilities in India in this important phase of her Third Five Year Plan.
The success of this cooperative enterprise will be a model for other similar efforts on the part of the United States to share our educational and technical resources with the peoples of the developing nations of the world.
I am particularly hopeful that Prime Minister Nehru will consider this project a souvenir of his visit.
