THEODORE GREEN was one of the first men I met when I came to Congress. Through all my years of public life he remained a friend and inspiration. I was not alone in those whose lives were strongly influenced by him and who felt deeply honored to work beside him. He championed integrity. He was a gentleman. His service to his Nation is the legacy he sought to leave. It will be an enduring memorial to a wise and honorable man.
