Good morning from the White House, everyone. I'm your pool reporter for the day. Contact info is below.
POTUS has no public events scheduled today. I will notify if that changes. Press briefing is scheduled for noon, and widely available for viewing.

In the morning, the President will receive the President's Daily Brief. This meeting will be closed press.
After, the President and the Vice President will receive the Weekly Economic Briefing in the Roosevelt Room. This meeting will be closed press.
Feel free to ping with questions and requests.
Two-minute warning for briefing.
