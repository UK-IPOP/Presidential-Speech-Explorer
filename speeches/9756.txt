My dear Judge Wilkerson:
I am in receipt of your letter of December 1st, asking that I should not resubmit your name to the Senate for appointment to the Seventh Circuit.
I deeply regret that you have come to this conclusion. I should have been proud to submit your name because I am confident that the people at large feel as I do the important and devoted service you have given, and the high contribution you have made to the standing of the judiciary of the United States.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Hon. James H. Wilkerson, United States District Court, Chicago, Ill.]
