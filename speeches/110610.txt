Verona, PA - Republican Presidential Candidate Rick Santorum published an opinion piece in this morning's Detroit News outlining his dynamic plan to revitalize the American manufacturing sector. The op-ed contrasts Rick Santorum's bright, bold vision against the top-down government-focused plan of President Obama.
Hogan Gidley, National Communications Director, said: "The differences between Barack Obama and Rick Santorum couldn't be more stark. Rick Santorum is advocating for free-people and free-markets to rebuild our industrial center from the bottom-up, the same way it became great in the first place. Barack Obama believes in the heavy hand of government, and defers decisions and policy ideas to his friends in the environmental fringe and Big Labor bosses.
While gas prices continue climbing, this President decides to stop a job-creating energy-producing project like the Keystone Pipeline. The negative impact that this decision has on every American and American business seems to be obvious to everyone but President Obama. We need a president who understands the problems facing our industrial base and who will put people ahead of radical environmental policies - and that leader is Rick Santorum."
