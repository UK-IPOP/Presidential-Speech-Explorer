Dear Mr. Secretary General:
As you leave the United States, I want to tell you again how pleased we were to have you here as our guest and for the opportunity for extended discussions.
I found our talks on the state of the North Atlantic Alliance and its future needs and hopes useful and rewarding. I was particularly pleased that you were able to join me in visiting the Strategic Air Command in Omaha for I think it gave both of us another opportunity to see how closely the strategic strength of the United States and the effectiveness of the Alliance are tied together.
As I have emphasized several times, the United States is dedicated to NATO. The American commitment to the Alliance is firm and real. We in the United States remain ready, as I know you do, to work with all our allies to insure that ours is a growing partnership of freedom based on shared responsibility for the most effective defense of our people and our freedom.
More personally, I would like you to know that your visit here gave us a new sense of confidence in your leadership and your dedication to a most challenging task. You have my assurance that this Government will give you the closest possible cooperation as you carry on at the helm of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
Good luck, and very best wishes.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
