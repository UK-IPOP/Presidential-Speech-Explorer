A lunch lid was called until 2:00 p.m.
It has been a quiet morning at the White House, with no public events on the president's schedule. Pool will advise if that changes.
Pooler did not catch this Rudy Giuliani gaggle on the WH driveway a bit ago, but C-Span has posted video: 
WH has just updated schedule to include press secretary briefing at 4:30 p.m.
WH press secretary Kayleigh McEnany started the briefing at 4:43 p.m., which is being livestreamed.
McEnany ended briefing at 5:05 p.m. after calling on (pool believes) everyone seated in the room and one reporter in the back.
A travel/photo lid was called at 5:20 p.m.
Pooler did not see POTUS today. Have a great evening everyone.
