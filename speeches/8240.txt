My dear Mr. Johnson:
Please express for me to those gathered at the services of dedication of the new building of the Y.M.C.A. of Philadelphia and those who have taken any part in bringing it into existence my congratulations upon the completion of the building marking the success of their labors in providing a new instrumentality of usefulness in behalf of the service men and young people of Philadelphia. I wish you all every success in this fine and constructive field of human service.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
