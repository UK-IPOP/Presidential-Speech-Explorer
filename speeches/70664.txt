The Administration is committed to enacting a responsible Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) in this Congress that is consistent with preserving a balanced budget, authorizes those projects and programs vital to the Nation, and adopts other needed program reforms. The Administration, however, has concerns about the total cost of S. 2131 and the efficacy of authorizing a sizeable number of new projects and programs in view of the existing backlog and continuing constrained budget resources. The Administration looks forward to working with Congress in determining the scope of the program and to resolving differences that move the Nation closer to a mutually satisfactory program.
The Administration welcomes continued dialogue with Congress to align the number of projects under construction with a reasonable expectation of future resources. The existing backlog of Army Corps of Engineers construction projects is already very large. It will require over $21 billion in FY 1999 and future Federal appropriations to complete the Corps construction projects already underway. In addition, over half of the almost 300 projects authorized in WRDA 1996 will not have received any construction funding through FY 1999.
The Administration believes it is appropriate to authorize an amount of construction spending equal to what can reasonably be funded within the two-year WRDA reauthorization cycle. To do more would only add to the existing backlog.
The Administration urges Congress to make additional WRDA reforms and improvements to continue improving the direction and focus for the Corps water resources projects and programs. These changes include:
S. 2131 would affect direct spending and receipts, therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. The preliminary OMB PAYGO estimate of the bill is displayed below. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from this estimate.
