, 
Good morning from Wilmington, Del., where it's partly cloudy and cool (52 degrees). Nothing public on the sked today for POTUS here. Only change is earlier return to WH - now scheduled for 7:30 pm.
We have a lunch lid 4:30. Apologies for late report!
The pool has been swept at its staging location near POTUS residence, and awaits motorcade for the drive to Delaware Air National Guard base in New Castle. From there POTUS will take Marine One back to Washington, scheduled to land on the Ellipse at 7:30 pm. Pool will take an Osprey to JBA.
Motorcade is rolling for Delaware Air National Guard base at 6:19 pm.
Motorcade arrived Delaware Air National Guard base at 6:28 pm. Drive was uneventful.
Truck with big Trump 2020 sign sat at side of road near entrance to DANG.
POTUS and FLOTUS boarded Marine One at 6:30 pm, lifting off soon for DC. He did not gaggle.
Pool is taking Osprey to JBA. Now handing off to in-town pooler for M1 landing on the Ellipse. Thanks to Wilmington co-poolers for their good cheer!
Happy rest of Sunday.
