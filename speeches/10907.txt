I have the honor to transmit herewith for the consideration of Congress an estimate of appropriation for the fiscal year 1931, amounting to $150,000,000, for an emergency construction fund to enable the Chief Executive to accelerate work on construction projects already authorized by law so as to increase employment.
In my annual message to the Congress, I requested that an appropriation of from $100,000,000 to $150,000,000 be granted for this purpose, and this estimate is in furtherance of that request. As I stated in that message, the application of this money to work already authorized by the Congress not only limits its application to work already directed by Congress but assures its use in directions, the economic importance of which has already been determined by Congress. This plan also avoids the long delays incident to selection of new projects by Congress and the further long delays in technical preparation which new projects would require, both of which would render such action of no purpose in emergency relief of unemployment.
I suggested in my message that the allocation of the monies between the different authorized projects should be made upon recommendation of a committee of the Cabinet. Such a committee should comprise the Secretaries of the Treasury, War, Navy, Commerce, and Agriculture, and may be established in the terms of the appropriation or appointed by me.
The test of the value of such relief is the ability to pay wages between now and the end of the fiscal year, and I therefore urge .that this estimate be given early consideration.
The details concerning this estimate are set forth in the letter of the Director of the Bureau of the Budget, transmitted herewith

Respectfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[The Speaker of the House of Representatives ]
