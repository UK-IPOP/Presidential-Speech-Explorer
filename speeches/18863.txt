[Released April 10, 1959. Dated April 9, 1959]
Dear Mr. Stans:
I am enclosing a copy of a report by Mr. E. R. Quesada on the implementation of the Curtis Report on "Aviation Facilities Planning." Mr. Quesada's report indicates a high percentage of implementation of the recommendations made by Mr. Curtis. However, the recommendation pertaining to the replacement of the Air Coordinating Committee by arrangements for interagency cooperation in keeping with the intent of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 is still not implemented.
I should like the Bureau of the Budget to undertake an analysis of this recommendation and to present to me, as soon as possible, recommendations for such action as may be found desirable and appropriate. Your analysis should identify areas of aviation activity in which interagency cooperation will be required and should suggest efficient and workable arrangements for bringing about such cooperation.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
