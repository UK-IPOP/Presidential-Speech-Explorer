THE PRESIDENT considers that the misjudged youths calling themselves Communists who have been arrested for demonstrating in front of the Executive offices should be released and sent to their parents.
He does not believe that any such discourtesy seriously endangers the Republic and that a night in jail is only doing them a favor of cheap martyrdom.
