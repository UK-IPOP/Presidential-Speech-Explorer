Good news for Marco: On GOP side, the Des Moines Register has endorsed the eventual nominee every time since 1996.

In two meetings with the editorial board, the whip-smart senator displayed an impressive grasp of public policy detail, reeling off four-point plans on foreign policy and other issues. He proposes overhauling higher education and promoting vocational training, helping workers threatened by automation acquire skills rewarded by a new economy.

Rubio would prime that new economy by embracing innovation. He would auction off portions of the wireless spectrum controlled by government, allowing freer flow of online traffic. He'd remove barriers to enable the next Uber to take off. He'd require a cost-benefit analysis of federal regulations.
