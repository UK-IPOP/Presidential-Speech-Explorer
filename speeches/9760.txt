THE DEATH of Mrs. H. Otto Wittpenn removes from the service of the Nation a leader in humanitarian effort whose broad vision, warm sympathy and high ideals will long inspire gratitude and memory. She gave distinguished representation to the United States upon the International Prison Commission. I am deeply grieved to learn of her death.
