I AM deeply shocked and saddened to learn of the sudden and tragic passing of Donald A. Quarles, Deputy Secretary of Defense. As Deputy Secretary--and prior to that as Secretary of the Air Force--Mr. Quarles devoted his extraordinary talents to the service of his country. His contribution was of inestimable value to the security, not only of the United States, but of that of the entire free world.
I share with his associates in the Government a keen sense of personal loss. Mrs. Eisenhower and I extend our deepest sympathies to Mrs. Quarles and to the family.
