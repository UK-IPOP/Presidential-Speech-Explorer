The images that have flashed across the news in recent months of injustice, protest, division, and even violence all have one thing in common: they're happening in Donald Trump's America. And instead of bringing the nation together to address our challenges, unite and heal together, the current president has fanned the flames. In a desperate attempt to avert blame for the chaos, division and failure that has defined his presidency, Trump and his team have tried to shift it onto Joe Biden. But here's the thing: we're living in Donald Trump's America.

Joe Biden has been very clear: violence is unacceptable, no matter who commits it. He has shown by example that a real leader can stand up for equal justice -- listening to the families and communities in pain, and taking action to unite the country -- while unequivocally condemning violence of all kinds.

It's clear why more Americans trust Joe Biden on the issue of public safety.
