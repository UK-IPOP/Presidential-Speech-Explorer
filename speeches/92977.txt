"Not only was Mitt Romney unsuccessful in cutting taxes, he raised them. Fees went up, government spending went up, and we still don't know just how much his universal health care plan will cost Massachusetts for generations to come. By any measure, Mitt Romney was unable to bring about the fiscal discipline in Massachusetts that Mayor Rudy Giuliani brought to New York City."
--Former Massachusetts Governor Paul Cellucci

 "In 2006, Governor Romney proposed and signed into law a private, market-based reform that ensures every Massachusetts citizen will have health insurance, without a government takeover and without raising taxes." (Romney For President Website, 
, Accessed 6/25/07)
 "The impact of this law on employers is substantial … [T]he reality is that the $295 penalty is small potatoes compared with the other obligations in the law. Say, for example, you open a restaurant and don't provide health coverage. If the chef's spouse or child is rushed to the hospital and can't pay because they don't have insurance, you — the employer — are responsible for up to 100% of the cost of that medical care. There is no cap on your obligation. Once the costs reach $50,000, the state will start billing you and fine you $5,000 a week for every week you are late in filling out the paperwork on your uncovered employees (Section 44). These provisions are onerous enough to motivate the owners of small businesses to limit their full-time workforce to 10 people, or even to lay employees off."

 "'This is certainly a tax increase on business,' declared Mike Tanner, health-care analyst at the free-market Cato Institute in Washington, D.C.

 "[T]he 'Connector' is a species of quasi-independent state bureaucracy with the power to set its own salaries. Former Gov. Mitt Romney once 'railed against [such agencies] for their overly generous compensation packages' — that is, until he created one." ("One Reason Why RomneyCare Costs So Much," Cato Institute's "
" Blog, 1/30/07)
 "RomneyCare has not even been fully implemented yet, and a cost overrun of $151 million in 2007 alone is already in the cards, perhaps because the RomneyCare financial model assumed the wrong number of uninsured in Massachusetts (the Census Bureau puts it at 748,000, but RomneyCare assumes only 500,000)."
