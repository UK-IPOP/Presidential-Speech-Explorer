Senator, I just want to comment on the commercials that have been running on your behalf that I have been watching on television. I want to thank you for them. They are positive, and they are expressing an American vision, and a New American Century, and I think that's something that's sorely needed to be states.

I haven't heard anyone speak like that who is running for President since Ronald Reagan in 1980, and I want to thank you for that.
