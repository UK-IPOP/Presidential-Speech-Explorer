"I Don't Want To Say Anything In The Debate That's Not Completely Accurate." — Vice President Joe Biden, October 4, 2012
 BIDEN: "The centerpiece of their economic plan was giving what they call the 'job creators' a bigger tax break, right? And they had a plan that cost $5 trillion in tax cuts." (Vice President Joe Biden, Remarks, Council Bluffs, IA, 10/4/12)
 BURNETT: "Right. So you're saying if you lower them by 20% you get a $5 trillion tab, right?" CUTTER: "It's a $5 trillion tab."  BURNETT: "But then when you close deductions it's not going to be anywhere near $5 trillion. That's our analysis." CUTTER: "Well, okay, stipulated, it won't be near $5 trillion, but it's also not going to be the sum of $5 trillion in the loopholes that he's going to close." (

 "Obama accused Romney of proposing a $5 trillion tax cut. Not true. Romney proposes to offset his rate cuts and promises he won't add to the deficit." (Brooks Jackson, "Dubious Denver Debate Declarations."

 KARL: "Okay, so, the big thing there, and he came back to it several times, is Governor Romney has a $5 trillion tax cut plan. I rate that mostly fiction." (ABC's "Your Voice: 2012Presidential Debates," 10/3/12)
 "Obama's claim that Romney wants to cut taxes by $5 trillion doesn't add up. Presumably, Obama was talking about the effect of Romney's tax plan over 10 years, which is common in Washington. But Obama's math doesn't take into account Romney's entire plan." (Calvin Woodward, "FACT CHECK: Presidential Debate Missteps,"

 BIDEN: "And they say -- and if you want to -- if you want to buy back into Medicare, you can do that -- except the first plan they introduced, in fact, the so-called CBO -- the sort of arbiter, the Congressional Budget Office -- they said that plan would cost seniors out-of-pocket -- the average senior $6,400 a year -- (jeers) -- a year more for the same exact Medicare people are getting now." (Vice President Joe Biden, Remarks, Charlotte, NC, 10/2/12)
 "But he still clung to an outdated estimate of an earlier version of the plan, claiming it will cost seniors an extra $6,000 a year. (He had previously earned Two Pinocchios for this claim.) The problem is this dollar figure—usually expressed as $6,400--is an estimate for an earlier version of Ryan's plan. He's since changed it significantly to address some of the loudest complaints. The new version of the plan includes the option for traditional Medicare, as well as a commitment that at least one health-care option would be fully covered by the government."

 "Not long after Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz told seniors at Century Village of Boca Raton they could be socked with $6,300 a year in higher Medicare costs under Mitt Romney, Vice President Joe Biden acknowledged the figure is based on an analysis of an outdated plan. But Biden argued it's fair for Democrats to keep using the number, anyway." (George Bennett, "Biden OK With Democrats Citing Outdated Number To Fault Romney On Health Care,"

 BIDEN: "Here's the deal, folks. We laid out a $4 trillion debt-reduction plan over the next 10 years -- $4 trillion." (Vice President Joe Biden, Remarks, Fort Myers, FL, 9/29/12)
 (Glenn Kessler, "Fact Checking Bill Clinton's Speech And Other Democrats At The Convention In Charlotte," 
, 9/6/12)
 "We are encouraged that President Obama has embraced the goal of stabilizing the debt and the target of achieving at least $4 trillion in deficit reduction. Unfortunately, his proposal falls short of this goal by counting war savings that were already planned; and while it does (barely) stabilize the debt, it does so at a dangerously high level and with no margin for error. We are disappointed, too, that the president did not address the long-term solvency of Social Security." (Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, Op-Ed, "Go Big, Be Bold, Be Smart,"

 BIDEN: "They're saying we raised taxes on the middle class and we're going to raise more taxes on the middle class, none of which is true. We've cut taxes for the middle class a total of $3,600 a year." (Vice President Joe Biden, Remarks, Council Bluffs, IA, 10/4/12)

 "In a new paper, AEI's Matt Jensen looks at the real annual cost of servicing the debt for households at various levels of income — including a potentially higher tax burden. As the table below illustrates, a household making between $100,000 and $200,000 a year could find its tax liability higher by roughly $2,400 every year. Over ten years, that works out to $24,000. And when you add in the debt already accrued the past four years under President Obama (the second table), that's another $1,600 a year. So now we are now talking about $4,000 a year, $40,000 over ten years." (James Pethokoukis, "Study: Obama's Big Budget Deficits Could Mean A $4,000 A Year Middle-Class Tax Hike,"
