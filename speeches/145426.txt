The Biden Administration made available today nearly $5 billion in funding to build out the country's first national network of electric vehicle chargers. The program will distribute funds over five years to help states create a network of charging stations, particularly along the Interstate Highway System. President Biden's historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is making EV charging accessible and his Made in America policies are ensuring that the EV future is being built in America. That means good-paying, union jobs building electric vehicles and chargers.
To ensure a convenient, affordable, and equitable charging experience for all users, the newly established Joint Office of Energy and Transportation is focusing on making charging accessible in rural and underserved communities. The President made a commitment to deliver at least 40 percent of the benefits of climate investments to disadvantaged communities, and these investments deliver on that promise.
Today, an American family that chooses an EV will save up to $1,000 a year on fuel. That means direct savings to consumers, and critical reductions in emissions from America's largest source of climate pollution – transportation. National outlets highlighted these historic investments, their equitable distribution, and the savings they will bring to hard-working Americans.
