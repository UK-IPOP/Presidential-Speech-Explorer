— The Cruz for President campaign has released its 
 highlighting Sen. Cruz's #CruzCountry #CruzToVictory bus tour through seven southern states that represent 356 of the 1,236 delegates needed to win the Republican nomination:


In stops along the tour in South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Oklahoma, standing-room-only crowds of courageous conservatives showed up to support Sen. Cruz. As a result, many events had to be moved outdoors to parking lots or fields to accommodate the overwhelming demand.
