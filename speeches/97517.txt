ARLINGTON, VA -- Today, McCain-Palin 2008 released its latest television ad, entitled "Folks." The ad highlights Barack Obama's defense of his extreme liberal voting record by accusing others of lying. Despite Barack Obama's protests, the truth is very clear that Barack Obama is the most liberal member of the United States Senate. The ad will be televised nationally.
