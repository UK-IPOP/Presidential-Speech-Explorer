"I will work harder than anyone to actually make the changes that make your lives better."
Hillary fought for every vote in the New Hampshire primary. And when she came up short, she took the stage to address the thousands of people who worked so hard for her in the Granite State.
And Hillary made an important pledge:

  " Here's what I'll promise: I will work harder than anyone to actually make the changes that make your lives better."
She talked about the many things that she and Senator Sanders agree on—like the need to overturn Citizens United and guarantee that Wall Street can never be allowed to once again threaten Main Street.
But she also talked about the choice voters have in this election.

  " The real differences in this race are truly over how do we create a future of prosperity, opportunity, and security for all of us."
She vowed to "break through the barriers of bigotry" and make sure that nothing is holding Americans back.
And she reminded the audience that this is not a new fight for her.

  " When children anywhere in our country go to bed hungry, or are denied a quality education, or who face abuse or abandonment, that diminishes all of us."

  " When people anywhere in America are held back by injustice, that demands action. "
She thanked everyone who is helping to make this campaign what it is—and build a better tomorrow for all our children and grandchildren.
