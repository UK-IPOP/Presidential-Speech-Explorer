 Hello.
 Hello, Mr. President.
 Mr. Maggio?
 Yes, sir.
 Happy birthday.
 Thank you, sir.
 I heard you're in Tampa with a big group of family members and friends.
 Right. That's my home in Tampa. Been in Tampa—my home since 1903.
 That's great. And this is your actual birthday, on this Veterans Day, is that right?
 Actual birthday, November the 11th at 11 o'clock at night.
 That's amazing. And you were among the first group of people from Tampa to volunteer for World War I, weren't you?
 Yes, sir. I sure did.
 Well, I really appreciate you.
 Thank you.
 I appreciate you and—do you have all your children there?
 All here.
 And a lot of grandchildren there?
 I got grandchildren and a greatgrandchild here. It's the fifth generation.
 That's great.
 They come from Fort Lauderdale just to celebrate my birthday.
 I bet you're proud of that.
 I sure am.
 You've been very fortunate, haven't you?
 I've been very fortunate with my family. Got a beautiful family. And all— all of the boys that were servicemen—ex-servicemen—all have been servicemen.
 I know you're proud of them.
 And I'm proud of them. The whole six of them.
 Well, I just wanted to wish you a happy birthday, and I wanted to tell you that I'm proud of you, and I'm very grateful that our country has had someone like you——
 Thank you.
 ——living here throughout the 20th century, seeing all the changes you've seen, and making the sacrifices you've made so that we could stay a free country and——
 I've seen plenty.
 You have seen a lot, haven't you.
 Yes, good and bad.
 Yes. But we can still bring immigrants to our shores and give them a shot at a better life because of people like you. And I really thank you for it.
 Thank you.
 And you have a wonderful day.
 Have a beautiful day, too. Thank you.
 Tell your family I said hello.
 Mr. President says hello to the family.
