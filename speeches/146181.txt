The pool joined President Biden's motorcade from his house in Wilmington at 2:04 p.m., and we are now rolling to Delaware Air National Guard (DANG) base.
President Biden arrived at DANG at 2:13 p.m. and boarded Marine One shortly thereafter to return to Washington. Biden will land on the South Lawn and pool will follow in an Osprey to JBA, so handing off to in-town pool.
