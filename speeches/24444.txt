AT THIS very minute, somewhere in Vietnam, the American Red Cross is saving a soldier's life--feeding a starving child-sheltering a refugee family.
At this very minute, somewhere in America, our Red Cross is helping with a personal tragedy--easing a community crisis--tackling and solving the problems and emergencies of life.
At this minute, in these difficult hours, I am deeply grateful for the Red Cross. We should all be grateful--and very proud.
We should all remember Hurricane Betsy --and how the Red Cross rescued thousands from the brink of that disaster. We should all remember the nurses, doctors, and countless volunteers who stand watch around the clock in hospitals, tents, shelters--wherever there is human need or suffering--here and in Vietnam this very minute.
We should remember and give thanks--by giving our personal support to Red Cross Month. The Red Cross needs volunteers and funds. No dollar sign can measure the priceless service they provide. I ask every American to give--and generously--to the Red Cross.
The Red Cross has never failed us. We cannot fail it now. We owe it the goodness of our hearts and the labors of our hands. I know we shall offer a full measure of both volunteers and funds.
