Today, at the General Motors Allison Transmission Plant, in White Marsh, Maryland, Hillary outlined her Green Jobs plan, which will stimulate economic growth, end our dependence on foreign oil and provide good-paying jobs in Maryland and around the country. Hillary's plan will transform the way we use energy, finally require large oil companies to pay their fair share towards renewable technologies, and create at least five million new jobs in the process.
Hillary's Green Jobs Plan will:
Exxon Mobil just reported the highest quarterly and annual profits ever for a U.S. company - earnings of $11.7 billion in profit in the final quarter of 2007 and $40.61 billion in all of 2007 ["Exxon shatters profit records," 2/1/08, money.cnn.com]; and
Shell's revenues increased 60% between the 4th quarter of 2006 and the 4th quarter of 2007; BP's revenues increased by 53% over the same period [money.cnn.com].
Hillary believes our climate crisis presents us with a significant opportunity. She is prepared to harness America's entrepreneurial spirit and make the bold investments necessary to lead us to an energy independent future, of which green-collar jobs are the cornerstone.
