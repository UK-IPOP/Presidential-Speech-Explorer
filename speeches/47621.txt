The Administration supports reauthorization of the Rehabilitation Act. The Administration does not object to House passage of H.R. 4021, but will seek amendments in the Senate to:


— increase from 20 to 25% the State matching requirement for the State grant program as proposed in the Administration's five-year reauthorization legislation; and

— enact the 10% grantee match for the Centers for Independent Living program included in the Administration's bill.
