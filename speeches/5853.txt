I transmit herewith communications to me from the Secretary of Commerce and Labor, the Commissioner of Fisheries, and Dr. H. R. Gaylord, Director of the New York State Cancer Laboratory, in respect to the necessity for an active investigation into the subject of cancer in fishes, and I respectfully request an appropriation of $50,000 for the purpose of erecting one or more laboratories at suitable places and to provide for the proper personnel and maintenance of these laboratories. Were there a bureau of public health such as I have already recommended, the matter could be taken up by that bureau, and if in the wisdom of the Congress it should be provided in the near future, all such instrumentalities as that for which appropriation is here recommended may be placed in that bureau as the proper place for research in respect of human diseases.
I have directed the Secretary of Commerce and Labor and the Secretary of the Treasury to forward an estimate for the appropriation here recommended, in accordance with the procedure provided by law.
The very great importance of pursuing the investigation into the cause of cancer can not be brought home to the Congress or to the public more acutely than by inviting attention to the memorandum of Doctor Gaylord herewith. Progress in the prevention and treatment of human diseases has been marvelously aided by an investigation into the same disease in those of the lower animals which are subject to it, and we have every reason to believe that a close investigation into the subject of cancer in fishes, which are frequently swept away by an epidemic of it, may give us light upon this dreadful human scourge.
