 In 2005, about 4 million taxpayers were affected by the AMT. Without extending the AMT relief through the temporary patch in the tax relief package, this number would rise to 22.2 million taxpayers in 2006.
 The unemployment rate is 4.7 percent.
 This follows our economic growth of 3.5 percent in 2005 - the fastest rate of any major industrialized nation.
 Hourly compensation rose at a 5.7 percent rate in the first quarter. Personal income rose 0.5 percent in March.
 To date, tax revenues have increased by 11 percent for FY 2006. Total tax receipts in April 2006 were the second highest in history for a one month period.
