THE PRESIDENT announced today that the administration had decided to recommend to Congress a special emergency appropriation to be applied to the further intensification of public works, public buildings, and other forms of Federal construction which are already authorized by Congress but for which no appropriations would normally be made until later periods; and further to recommend the provision of a "seed loan" assistance to farmers in the drought area.
It will be remembered that the appropriations for Federal construction were greatly increased upon the President's recommendation by the last Congress as aid to employment during the current year. The departments were also authorized to undertake necessary technical preparation for future construction work which was authorized but not appropriated for. As a result of appropriations available during the present fiscal year, the construction work of all kinds in the Federal Government will be increased to a total exceeding $500 million. The emergency appropriations that will be requested will be in the nature of an addition to this already enlarged program and will be in anticipation of such construction work as would normally have taken place a year or two hence. The necessary technical preparation has been underway for some months and has now been advanced so that the programs can be further expanded for emergency purposes. The precise amount for the emergency appropriation has not yet been decided upon but will be determined on a basis of authorized works for which the preliminary technical preparation has been or can be completed. The whole purpose is to provide further employment during the forthcoming year upon works of ultimate necessity.
