"The President called for a one-year AMT patch in February, but instead of acting promptly to send the President a bill he can sign, the House is just now considering a bill that would raise taxes on individuals and businesses by nearly $80 billion. If Congress continues in its failure to send the President an AMT patch he can sign into law, as many as 50 million taxpayers could face delays in the processing of their returns and $75 billion in refund checks could be delayed – essentially forcing American taxpayers to extend a $75 billion no-interest loan to the IRS. Congress should not be playing politics with money American families are counting on to pay off credit card debt or get current on their mortgage."
 This would amount to forcing American taxpayers to extend a $75 billion no-interest loan to the IRS.
 Since 2001, Congress has periodically "patched" exemption levels and credit rules to keep the number of AMT taxpayers roughly constant at about 4 million.
 Q: "Will you have an AMT patch to the White House before Thanksgiving?" SEN. REID: "No." (Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV), Media Availability Following Senate Policy Luncheons, Washington, DC, 11/6/07)
 Congress has had months to pass this legislation. Instead of spending time debating tax increases at this late date, they should quickly pass a patch that does not raise other taxes so the President can sign it into law.
