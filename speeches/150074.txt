This week, local news outlets are reporting about how President Biden's economic plan has led to a nationwide manufacturing boom that is creating good-paying jobs in communities across the U.S.
On Friday, President Biden traveled to Licking County, Ohio and declared: 
During his visit, he joined with Intel and Ohio leaders for the groundbreaking of a new semiconductor chip manufacturing facility that will create over 7,000 construction jobs and 3,000 full time jobs. The commitment from Intel was made possible by passage of the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, which President Biden signed into law a few weeks ago.
During the speech, the President also highlighted the latest string of manufacturing investments by companies across the U.S., including Wolfspeed, which announced Friday that they will invest $5 billion to build a new silicon chip factory that will create 1,800 good-paying jobs in North Carolina.
President Joe Biden told the crowd at the groundbreaking of Intel's semiconductor factories in Licking County on Friday that 
Biden celebrated Intel's investment in the factories as a sign of the return of American manufacturing in general, and semiconductor production in particular. "We need to make these chips right here in America," he said. "America's back. ... The future of the chip industry is going to be made in America, made in America."
Wolfspeed will build a new semiconductor plant at a 400-acre site in Chatham County with an estimated investment of $5 billion and a commitment to create more than 1,800 jobs paying $77,000 a year on averageâ€¦. The investment over time stands to be the largest in North Carolina history, exceeding the $4.5 billion commitment by automaker VinFast to build a plant. That investment is also going to Chatham County.
