: "It's estimated that 200 million people will die [from coronavirus] probably by the time I finish this talk."
Joe Biden grossly overstated the death toll from the coronavirus, saying nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population would be dead.
 "We can't keep rewriting history, scrambling norms, and ignoring our cherished system of checks and balances. That includes this whole business of releasing a list of potential nominees that I would put forward."
Biden's ignoring that he pledged to release a list of potential nominees back in June.
: "After Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away, they said Biden should release his list. It's no wonder the Trump campaign asked that I release the list only after she'd passed away. It's a game for them. It's a play to gin up emotions and anger."
Biden is flat out wrong; for months, President Trump and his campaign have been calling on Biden to release his list of potential Supreme Court nominees to the American people.
: "And by the way, there's no court session between now and the end of this election."
Biden is flat-out wrong; the first arguments of the Supreme Court's new term begin the first Monday of October.
