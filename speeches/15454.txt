THIS IS a very fine tribute. I appreciate it, and I hope I deserve it--and I hope I will continue to deserve it.
I have just received a book from a friend of mine awhile ago, on his tour of duty in Israel, and he passes around an immense amount of credit in my direction, which is not customary for publications in this present day and time.
I am very appreciative of your thoughtfulness in giving me this plaque. I will treasure it as long as I live.

Thank you very much.
