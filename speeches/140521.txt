VOICEOVER: "Hunter Biden Was reportedly paid $50,000 to $80,000 a month for several years for serving on Burisma's board." CBS NEWS' NORAH O'DONNELL: "Hunter said that the only thing you said to him was 'I hope that you know what you are doing.'" JOE BIDEN: "That's exactly right he's a grown man. What I meant by that is I hope he thought this through, I hope you know exactly what you're doing here." O'DONNELL: "Meaning what?" BIDEN: "That's all I met. Nothing more than that because I've never discussed my business or their business, my son's or daughter's and I've never discussed them because they know where I have to do my job and that's it and they have to make their own judgements." O'DONNELL: "Do you understand people say, Joe Biden, he's an experienced politician, statesman, knows the issues of Ukraine, why didn't he just say to his son this is one to take a pass on, it may not look good." BIDEN: "He was already on the board and he's a grown man and it turns out he did not do a single thing wrong as everybody's been investigated." (CBS, 10/27/19)






 JOE BIDEN: "No I don't because I never discussed with my son anything having to do with what was going on in Ukraine. That's a fact." (MSNBC, 10/16/20)






CNN'SANDERSON COOPER: "Mr. Vice President, as you said, your son, Hunter, today gave an interview, admitted that he made a mistake and showed poor judgement by serving on that board in Ukraine. Did you make a mistake by letting him? You were the point person on Ukraine at the time. You can answer." JOE BIDEN: "Look, my son's statement speaks for itself. I did my job. I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having do with Ukraine. No one has indicated I have. We've always kept everything separate. Even when my son was the attorney general of the state of Delaware, we never discussed anything, so there would be no potential conflict. My son made a judgment. I'm proud of the judgement he made. I'm proud of what he had to say." (Joe Biden, 
, Westerville, OH, 10/15/19)






JOE BIDEN: "I don't discuss business with my son. I didn't know that was the case when in fact I found out after the fact and because I don't discuss things with my son or my family because I don't want to have any knowledge of any, I don't want to be accused of 'well you talk with your son, you talk with your whomever.'" (WBZ, 10/9/19)

JOE BIDEN: "Well, first of all, I have never discussed with my son or my brother or anyone else anything having to do with their businesses. Period. And what I will do is the same thing we did in our administration. There will be an absolute wall between personal and private and the government. There wasn't any hint of scandal at all when I was there. And I'm going to propose the same kind of strict, strict rules. That's why I never talked with my son or my brother or anyone else – even distant family – about their business interests. Period."

"Hunter Biden introduced his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden, to a top executive at a Ukrainian energy firm less than a year before the elder Biden pressured government officials in Ukraine into firing a prosecutor who was investigating the company, according to emails obtained by The Post. The never-before-revealed meeting is mentioned in a message of appreciation that Vadym Pozharskyi, an adviser to the board of Burisma, allegedly sent Hunter Biden on April 17, 2015, about a year after Hunter joined the Burisma board at a reported salary of up to $50,000 a month. 'Dear Hunter, thank you for inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent [sic] some time together. It's realty [sic] an honor and pleasure,' the email reads."

"Hochstein spoke to Vice President Biden about concerns relating to Hunter Biden's role on Burisma's board because, according to Hochstein, Russians were using it to advance disinformation. According to testimony and public reports, Hochstein, then-U.S. Special Envoy and Coordinator for International Energy Affairs, raised concerns about Hunter Biden's role on Burisma's board directly to Vice President Biden.("Hunter Biden, Burisma, And Corruption: The Impact On U.S. Government Policy And Related Concerns," 
, 9/20)

DOWNEY: "How did Hunter Biden know you had a conversation with Vice President Biden?" HOCHSTEIN: "He told me that the Vice President told him that he had a discussion." DOWNEY: "So, in late October 2015, you have the conversation with Vice President Biden about Hunter's position on Burisma's board. He tells Hunter Biden, and then sometimes in the beginning of November 2015, you discuss Burisma with Hunter Biden?" KELLY KRAMER: "Again, we can't confirm or deny anything about a conversation that may or may not have happened with the Vice President. Otherwise, he can confirm that's an accurate statement, if it is." HOCHSTEIN: "It is true that I had--I raised the matter with Vice President Biden. It is true that Hunter Biden called me--or called--his office contacted my office, and I did meet with him sometime after that." (Amos Hochstein, 
, 9/17/20, p. 117)



"In December, 2015, as Joe Biden prepared to return to Ukraine, his aides braced for renewed scrutiny of Hunter's relationship with Burisma. Amos Hochstein, the Obama Administration's special envoy for energy policy, raised the matter with Biden, but did not go so far as to recommend that Hunter leave the board. As Hunter recalled, his father discussed Burisma with him just once: 'Dad said, 'I hope you know what you are doing,' and I said, 'I do.''"

"Investigations by the press, during impeachment, and even by two Republican-led Senate committees whose work was decried as 'not legitimate' and political by a GOP colleague have all reached the same conclusion: that Joe Biden carried out official U.S. policy toward Ukraine and engaged in no wrongdoing. Trump Administration officials have attested to these facts under oath. The New York Post never asked the Biden campaign about the critical elements of this story. They certainly never raised that Rudy Giuliani - whose discredited conspiracy theories and alliance with figures connected to Russian intelligence have been widely reported - claimed to have such materials. Moreover, we have reviewed Joe Biden's official schedules from the time and no meeting, as alleged by the New York Post, ever took place." (Andrew Bates, 
, 10/14/20)



"Hunter Biden's lawyer refused to comment on the specifics but instead attacked Giuliani. 'He has been pushing widely discredited conspiracy theories about the Biden family, openly relying on actors tied to Russian intelligence,' the lawyer, George R. Mesires, said of Giuliani. Pozharskyi and the Joe Biden campaign did not return requests for comment. Hochstein could not be reached."

"In December, 2013, Vice-President Biden flew to Beijing to meet with President Xi Jinping. Biden often asked one of his grandchildren to accompany him on his international trips, and he invited Finnegan to come on this one. Hunter told his father that he wanted to join them. According to a Beijing-based BHR representative, Hunter, shortly after arriving in Beijing, on December 4th, helped arrange for Li to shake hands with his father in the lobby of the American delegation's hotel. Afterward, Hunter and Li had what both parties described as a social meeting. Hunter told me that he didn't understand why anyone would have been concerned about this. 'How do I go to Beijing, halfway around the world, and not see them for a cup of coffee?' he said." (Adam Entous, "Will Hunter Biden Jeopardize His Father's Campaign?,"

"In June 2011, Krein's brother announced the launch of StartUp Health at the Health Data Initiative Forum, a conference in Bethesda, Md., put on by the Department of Health and Human Services. ... The day before the launch, Krein's brother scored a meeting with Obama and Biden in the Oval Office. Krein told the Philadelphia Business Journal that Biden was 'a big fan' of StartUp Health and had arranged the Oval Office meeting when Krein mentioned to his father-in-law that his business partners were in Washington. Krein's brother told the Business Journal that he used the meeting to let Obama know the administration's health reforms offered a potential 'treasure trove' to health startups. 'The President loved it and it became a talking point for him,' Krein's brother told the publication.

VOTER: "...But you on the other hand sent your son over there, to get a job and work for a gas company, that he had no experience with gas, or nothing. In order to get access for the President. So, you're selling access to the President just like he is." JOE BIDEN: "You're a damned liar, man. That's not true. And no one has ever said that... Look, the reason I'm running is because I've been around a long time and I know more than most people know. And I can get things done. That's why I'm running. And if you want to check my shape on, let's do pushups together, man. Let's run, let's do whatever you want to do. Let's take on two sets. That's number one. Number two. Number two, no one has said my son has done anything wrong, and I did not on any occasion, and no one has ever said it." VOTER: "I didn't say you were doing anything wrong."
