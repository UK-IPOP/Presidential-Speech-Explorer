 In recent weeks, ordinary men and women have taken to the streets in Burma in peaceful marches to demand their freedom and call for democratic change. Despite the world's just demands to stop their persecution, Burma's military junta has responded viciously, beating and killing monks and peaceful protestors and arresting thousands of pro-democracy protestors. In addition, Burma's dictator, Than Shwe, continues to hold captive Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of Burma's largest democratic party, the National League of Democracy.
 Sanctions against Burma were first imposed in 1997 with the issuance of Executive Order 13047. These sanctions were augmented in 2003, when President Bush signed the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act and issued Executive Order 13310 to freeze the assets of senior Burmese officials.
 This Order expands the Treasury Department's existing authority to designate individuals for sanctions to include: Individuals responsible for human rights abuses and public corruption; and individuals and entities who provide material or financial support to designated individuals or to the government of Burma.
 This will impact the export of "dual-use" goods and high performance computers to Burma.
 They should also allow Aung San Suu Kyi and other detained leaders to communicate with one another and permit UN Special Envoy Ibrahim Gambari to enter the country immediately.
 He commends nations such as Japan that have curtailed their assistance to Burma in response to the atrocities - and those in ASEAN such as Singapore, the Philippines, and Indonesia who have spoken out.
 This month, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called Mrs. Bush to thank her for her "unwavering support" for the people of Burma.
