"The middle class has been crushed under President Obama, but he doesn't seem to get it. Gas prices have doubled, incomes have dropped, poverty is headed toward fifty-year highs, and chronic unemployment is at unprecedented levels. But the Obama campaign now has a clear message for Americans – you're doing well, you just don't know it. Americans deserve a president who understands we're not better off and has a plan to fix it." – Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 NATALIE MORALES: "And let me begin by starting with that central question on a lot of people's minds, and that is are we better off today than we were four years ago when President Obama was elected?" CUTTER: "Absolutely." (NBC's "Today," 9/3/12)

 "Lower-paying jobs, with median hourly wages from $7.69 to $13.83, accounted for just 21% of the job losses during the recession. But they've made up about 58% of the job growth from the end of the recession in late 2009 through early 2012." (Jim Puzzanghera, "Majority Of New Jobs In Recovery Are Low-Paying, Study Finds,"

 "In January 2009, the month President Obama entered the Oval Office and shortly before he signed his stimulus spending bill, median household income was $54,983. By June 2012, it had tumbled to $50,964, adjusted for inflation. (See the chart nearby.) That's $4,019 in lost real income, a little less than a month's income every year."
