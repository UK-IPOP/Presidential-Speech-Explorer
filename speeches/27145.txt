DESPITE the many difficulties of its first year, the Corps has made a strong beginning. It offers bright promise for substantial improvement in the education of disadvantaged children, and it should be continued. This Council is convinced that to abandon or weaken the Teacher Corps would be a serious and wasteful error.
I hope this report will be read by every Member of Congress who is concerned about education in America. It confirms evidence we have received from every part of the country. The Teacher Corps meets a desperate need.
