Happy Sunday, everyone. I'm your print pooler today. Call time for the pool has been pushed back to 4:15 p.m. Otherwise there are no updates to the president's schedule, which has no public events on it as of now.
Pool is now gathering and loading into vans on the driveway along the South Lawn. Destination still TBD, but your pooler will provide updates accordingly.
Motorcade rolling from the White House at 5:27 p.m. Pooler did not spot POTUS getting into his vehicle.
Motorcade arrived at Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Georgetown at 5:37 and saw POTUS walk inside from down the sidewalk. Pool is holding outside.
President Biden exited the church at 6:32 p.m. Asked if he spoke to Ukrainian President Zelensky today, he responded "yes."
Pool loaded back into vans and motorcade is once again rolling at 6:34.
Motorcade arrived back at the White House at 6:41 p.m. after an uneventful ride. A lid was called at 6:44. Have a great rest of the evening!
