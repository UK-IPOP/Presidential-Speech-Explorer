Hey all â€“

Just wanted to check in for the day! Pool has been tested and we have a pretty light day scheduled. President Biden doesn't have any public events on his schedule but we do have a briefing at 3 today. And from the White House: "NSC Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby will join Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre for today's press briefing."


Ukrainian First Lady Olena Zelenska arrived at the White House via the South Lawn at 1:31 pm.

Surprise guest POTUS with a bouquet of flowers and FLOTUS greeted her.

Shoutout to Emily for the assist 


Per WH: "The Press Briefing will begin at 3:15 PM today."
