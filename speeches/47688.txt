The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 4600 because it would:


— unnecessarily and wastefully disrupt the organization of the Indian Health Service (IHS) by moving it from its present location with other health services programs in the Health Resources and Services Administration of the Public Health Service to the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services.

— maintain redundant sanitation construction authorities already in the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

— require numerous burdensome and costly reports, studies, and other new program responsibilities unrelated to the IHS basic health services delivery mission.
