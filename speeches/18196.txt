[Released January 13, 1953. Dated January 10, 1953]
Dear Charlie:
Effective at the end of my term of office, January 20, 1953, I accept your resignation as Secretary of Commerce, as you have asked me to do.
Since you took office in May 1948, you have done a great deal in bringing business and Government closer together, in administering the materials control program, in strengthening our national economy, and in preparing a plan for business men to cope with the problems of post-defense markets. These are accomplishments of which we both can be proud. I want also to commend you for your skillful management of the Department of Commerce and its constituent bureaus in the performance of their far-reaching activities in behalf of foreign and domestic commerce, shipping, aviation, transportation, science and invention.
I am grateful for your service during my administration and glad that it has been a satisfying experience for you. Please accept my good wishes.
Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
