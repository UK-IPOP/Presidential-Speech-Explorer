[ Released December 8, 1959. Dated December 2, 1959 ]
Dear Dr. Canham:
Your letter of November nineteenth arrived in my office only several days after I had received a report from the Director of the Bureau of the Budget on improvements in budgeting, present and contemplated. It occurred to me that this report was directly relevant to the questions you have raised, and I am taking the liberty of forwarding a copy of it to you.
Thank you for sending me so useful and constructive a letter on these important matters.
With warm regard,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
