Prime Minister and Mrs. Egal, Mr. Foreign Minister, Secretary and Mrs. Rusk, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen:
Mr. Prime Minister, it is a very special pleasure this morning to welcome you and Mrs. Egal to our Nation's Capital.
Vice President Humphrey has told me of the warm reception that he received on his visit to your country. He speaks often of the friendliness of your people and the warm hospitality he received from you and your President.
The people of America, Mr. Prime Minister, are delighted to have this opportunity to return your friendship.
We have watched with interest and admiration the development of the Somali Republic in the last 8 years. We know that you have succeeded in building one of the most effective democratic governments in all of Africa. We are aware of your noble efforts to bury ancient antagonisms and to get on with the work of peace.
I understand, Mr. Prime Minister, that this is your first visit to the United States. You will find many differences between our countries. But you will also find much that is the same.
Like you, we value the dignity and the freedom of the individual.
Like you, we are striving to perfect our democratic institutions, to provide better homes, better medical care, and better schools for all of our people.
Like you, we are working with all of our hearts and our minds to secure a just peace.
We are deeply proud that we have been able to offer a measure of help to your people in your own efforts to achieve these common goals.
I had hoped that we might welcome you this morning in the warm glow of a Washington spring. But Mother Nature has seen fit to give us instead just a parting taste of winter. But I know that you will find that our friendship for you and for your people flourishes in every season.
Mr. Prime Minister, we bid you and your lovely lady the warmest of our welcomes.
