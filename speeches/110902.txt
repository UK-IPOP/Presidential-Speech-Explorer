Unlike Newt Gingrich, Mitt Romney never sat next to Nancy Pelosi in an ad funded by George Soros on behalf of Al Gore's global warming initiative. As recently as 2008, the Soros agenda had no better friend than Newt Gingrich. Nice try, Mr. Speaker." —Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman
 PELOSI: "Hi! I'm Nancy Pelosi, life-long Democrat and Speaker of the House." GINGRICH: "And I'm Newt Gingrich, life-long Republican, and I used to be Speaker. PELOSI: "We don't always see eye to eye, do we Newt?" GINGRICH: "No, but we do agree: our country must take action to address climate change." PELOSI: "We need cleaner forms of energy, and we need them fast." GINGRICH: "If enough of us demand action from our leaders, we can spark the innovation we need. PELOSI: Go to WeCanSolveIt.org. Together, we can do this." (The We Campaign,
