Florida's March 15 winner-take-all primary could be the last chance for party voters to throw up a roadblock in billionaire businessman Donald Trump's march to the GOP nomination.

We recommend Florida Republicans cast their ballots for another Sunshine State leader, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio. Unlike Trump, Rubio has the knowledge and judgment to be president.
Where to begin on Trump's judgment? His idea of political discourse is hurling or tweeting insults at anyone who dares question him. He has maligned Mexican immigrants and Muslims. He has mocked people with disabilities and prisoners of war. He has disparaged and degraded women.

Lately Trump has been singing the praises of torturing suspected terrorists â€” which is not only illegal, but abhorrent to American values. He has called for changes in libel law to make it easier for politicians to muzzle the free press with lawsuits.
