The Administration is committed to enactment of legislation to reauthorize vocational-technical education programs, including a separate tech-prep program, as proposed in H.R. 1853. The Administration has serious reservations about H.R. 1853, but does not oppose House passage of the bill. The Administration will work to improve the bill in the Senate.
In its present form, the bill:
H.R. 1853 would affect direct spending and receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB estimates that H.R. 1853 would decrease direct spending by $1 million in FY 1998 and a total of $29 million during FYs 1998-2002.
