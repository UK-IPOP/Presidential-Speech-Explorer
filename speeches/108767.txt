AUSTIN — At his news conference this afternoon, Mitt Romney falsely denied that MIT economist Jonathan Gruber played a key role in creating Romneycare and the individual mandate that served as the blueprint for Obamacare.
"Mitt Romney has real problems shooting straight with the American people, especially on the clear policy and personnel links between Romneycare and Obamacare," said Perry spokesman Mark Miner. "Mr. Romney looked right into the camera and denied the facts — that his advisors helped craft the government-mandated Romneycare and Obamacare health care plans.
"We call on Mr. Romney to repudiate government-mandated health care as crafted in Romneycare and admit his policies and advisors ushered in Obamacare's costly and destructive health care mandates."
