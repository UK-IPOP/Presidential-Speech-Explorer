Happy New Year's Eve from St. Croix. I'll be your final print pooler of 2022.
The pool's call time got moved from noon to 2 p.m. local time.
No word yet on what the president is up to today, but it's 81 degrees, breezy and puffy white clouds are dotting the sunny skies.
The White House called a lid at 12:16 p.m. local time.
Hope everyone has a festive New Year's!
