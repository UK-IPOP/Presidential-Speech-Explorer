I am returning herewith H. R. 167, "An act to amend the act of February 12, 1925 (Public, No. 402, 68th Cong.), so as to permit the Cowlitz Tribe of Indians to file suit in the Court of Claims under said act," without my approval.
These claims amount to approximately $1,584,800, which represents the value, at $ 1.25 per acre, of 1,267,840 acres of land in the aboriginal possession of the Indians.
In returning S. 1480, without my approval, I said:
These claims are not based upon any treaty or agreement between the United States and these Indians, nor does it appear to me that they are predicated upon such other grounds as should obligate the Government at this late day to defend a suit of this character. The Government should not be required to adjudicate these claims of ancient origin unless there be such evidence of unmistakable merit in the claims as would create an obligation on the part of the Government to admit them to adjudication. It seems to me that such evidence is lacking.
The same objections apply to this bill (H. R. 167). I am compelled, therefore, to withhold my approval of this bill.
