I'm your supplemental pool report for Vice President Harris swearing in Bridget Brink to be ambassador to Ukraine.
At 5:37 pm the supplemental pool gathered in the Vice President's ceremonial office.
At 5:43 pm the family walked in.
At 6:21 the Vice President and ambassador-to-be walked in. The swearing- in began immediately.
The swearing-in was fast. The Vice President posed for a photo with the new ambassador and her family present.
Reporters were cut off as they tried to ask questions about the Supreme Court and Ukraine. The Vice President and the ambassador left the room at roughly 6:23 pm.
A White House official relayed the following:
Ambassador Brink's husband, Nicholas Higgins, holds the constitution and Bible for the swearing in.
Participants:
Ambassador Bridget Brink, U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine
Nicholas Higgins, Husband and Foreign Service Officer, 
 for International Development
Jack Higgins, Son
Cole Higgins, Son
Family and friends are also present for the swearing in.
At 6:29 pm pool was ushered out.
That's it for me.
