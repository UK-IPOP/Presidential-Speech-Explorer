I HAVE received and read with interest the report of the first year's activities of the Missile Sites Labor Commission.
I appointed the Commission a year ago to help resolve labor 'problems at our missile and space sites and to assure the country of uninterrupted and economical operations at these vital installations.
Through the combined efforts and cooperation of labor, management and government officials we have been able during the past year to reduce considerably the man days lost at these sites due to labor disputes. I think this is a tribute to all concerned with this program. When men of so many divergent interests can set aside their separate interests and work in harmony in the national interest, all Americans can be justifiably proud.
I know that our missile and space sites are not located in choice working areas. I know that in many cases the workers are exposed to undue hardships and that the remoteness of these sites makes sacrifice necessary. I also know that when the Nation demands it our people will respond.
I am certain that the American people join me in congratulating the Commission and the workers and management representatives at the sites for the job they have done. The record that has been set, while good, is not 'perfect, and perhaps we can never reach perfection. I am confident, however, that the Commission will continue to get the cooperation of all our workers, our labor unions and our management officials in making sure that our missile and space programs go forward uninterrupted by labor disputes and as economically as possible. Such cooperative effort is necessary for the defense and progress of our nation.
