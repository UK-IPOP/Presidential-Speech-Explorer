THE WHITE HOUSE today released the text of a letter from Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg, Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, reporting their conclusions following a joint review conducted by the Department of Defense and the Atomic Energy Commission of the status of progress during the past 8 months on the implementation of the Limited Test Ban Treaty Safeguards recommended by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and approved by the late President Kennedy.
In releasing this letter, the President reemphasized the statement he made today in a speech before the Associated Press that his administration is committed to the policy first expressed in the four points in President Kennedy's letter to Senators Mansfield and Dirksen on September 11, 1963. These four points were restated in the McNamara-Seaborg letter released today.
The President also pointed out that while an adequate underground testing program is, under present circumstances, essential to our national security, the United States continues to be alert to possibilities for the relaxation of tensions and the building of a permanent peace. Although we are testing nuclear weapons as now permitted by the Limited Test Ban Treaty, we still support a complete cessation of all testing of nuclear weapons accompanied by an adequate system of inspection to ensure both sides against violations. The United States Government is ready at any time to negotiate a treaty providing for such a comprehensive test ban.
