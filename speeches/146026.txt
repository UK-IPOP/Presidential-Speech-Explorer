WASHINGTON -- President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. approved Kentucky's request for an expedited major disaster declaration Sunday night. The declaration authorizes federal assistance for disaster survivors in Caldwell, Fulton, Graves, Hopkins, Marshall, Muhlenberg, Taylor and Warren counties.
The declaration was granted after FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell and DHS Sec. Alejandro Mayorkas visited affected areas of Kentucky Sunday to see tornado destruction firsthand and meet with 
 conducting operations throughout the state.
"To all of the people of Kentucky, my heart goes out to each and every one of you who have experienced the tragic events from these tornadoes. I want you to know that the nation, your country, is praying with you," said Administrator Criswell following the visit. Criswell said it was important for her and the secretary to see the damaged areas firsthand "so we can make sure that we're providing the right level of assistance to help with your response and your ongoing recovery."
FEMA's priorities are to support lifesaving and life-sustaining actions. The agency continues working with federal, state, local, tribal and non-governmental partners to support the needs of areas affected by the tornado outbreak.
