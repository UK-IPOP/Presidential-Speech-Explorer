— The Newt 2012 campaign added to its "All-Star" Oklahoma leadership today announcing a strong political steering committee for Oklahoma.
The leadership team includes:
State Chairman J.C. Watts and State Director Chad Alexander have put together a strong grassroots effort in Oklahoma, recruiting some of Oklahoma's most powerful leaders.  "We have organized an outspoken team of political leaders who can deliver a win for Speaker Gingrich on Super Tuesday," said Chad Alexander.
Newt echoed that sentiment praising the group "for their commitment to the cause of conservativism.  We need bold solutions and strong leadership to lower the price of gasoline to $2.50 per gallon, create jobs and defend America. I am honored that these leaders have joined in the fight."
