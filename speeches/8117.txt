Dear Dr. Moron:
I have been greatly impressed by the constructive work of the Commission on Interracial Cooperation.
The solution of all conflict is that men and women of good-will shall search and find the areas where we can cooperate, and thus minimize differences. That is the sane, simple and sensible plan of the Commission. It is of real national importance. I trust it will have the widest support.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
