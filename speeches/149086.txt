Hello all,
I'm your pooler for the VP's engagement with French President Emmanuel Macron at NASA HQ.
We're holding with the French pool awaiting the start of the meeting.
Here's some background from the VP's office:


Pool was ushered in at 10:44am.
The VP & the French President were seated side by side and the rest of the attendees around an L shaped table.
The VP spoke for several minutes calling France a vital partner.
President Macron followed.
They wrapped up their opening remarks at 10:54am.
President Macron acknowledged one shouted question on whether he was concerned about Ukraine funding with Republicans controlling the House. It was hard to hear with all the commotion of being ushered out but he said something along the lines of: he wanted to focus on the topic at hand, space.
Will send quotes soon.
Participating in the briefing were the French Ambassador to the US and the US ambassador to France as well as several french ministers (Economy, Foreign Affairs, Higher Education & research)
Also in attendance, NASA administrator Bill Nelson & French astronaut Thomas Pesquet.
Still waiting for a full official list of attendees.
Kamala Harris:
"France is a vital ally for the US"
"So Mr. President today we have the occasion to celebrate the cooperation of our two nations in space."
"I believe space remains a place of undiscovered and unrealized opportunities. And for that reason, there's so much potential in terms of the work that nations can do there. And in particular, when we work together, based on shared principles, and values, to seize these opportunities."
Emmanuel Macron (spoke in English)
"we did a lot together in the past decades and I think we can do a lot and we have a lot of projects. I want to thank you personally because indeed when you came one year ago in Paris, we had this very long discussion, we decided together to strengthen this cooperation and larger strategic dialogue of space."
"Space is the new place of conflict. And, we have crazy players in this space as well. And we have rogue states. And we have new hybrid attacks. And I think it's very important together because we do share this history. We do have the same commitment and attachment to science and progress that we do share as well as democratic values and I think building these new rules and setting them together is for us very important."

Good afternoon
I'm your pooler as Vice President Harris is due to deliver remarks at the White House Tribal Nations Summit at 3pm.
This event is at the Department of the Interior.
It will be live-streamed at 
This on background from a White House official:
, Vice President Harris will deliver remarks at the 2022 White House Tribal Nations Summit, which will be livestreamed on 
.
In her remarks, the Vice President will focus on how improving maternal health, increasing access to capital, fighting the climate crisis, and protecting the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) will help build a future where all people have the opportunity to succeed and thrive. The Vice President will outline the Administration's actions to address these issues, and will emphasize the Administration's commitment to working with Tribal leaders.
This year's in-person summit brings together Tribal leaders to discuss top priorities, key policies, and critical issues that impact Tribal communities. Last year, the Vice President delivered remarks at the all-virtual Summit, where she highlighted the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law's investment in Tribal broadband and the need to protect Native voting rights.
Alongside President Biden, Vice President Harris has led the Administration's efforts to create opportunity and to promote equity in Tribal communities:






Vice President Harris was introduced by Chairman Mark Macarro, Tribal Chairman at Penchanga Band of Luiseno Indians.
She spoke in a large auditorium on a stage flanked by flags, and in front of a blue background.
A reminder: the livestream is here - 
Some quotes:
"Every day tribal leaders help America live up to our highest ideals."
"You speak truth about our country's history so the lessons of our past can lead us to a better future."
"The bonds between our nations are sacred."
She said the administration had a "duty to honor tribal sovereignty, to ensure tribal self-determination."
"We must always speak truth, no matter how difficult it is for some to hear, about our history."
She said "deep disparities persist" and "we have put equity at the center of all our work."
Vice President Harris spoke for 15 minutes.
Some more quotes:
"Native communities are on the front line in the fight against the climate crisis."
"Across America, Native communities are disproportionately impacted by toxic air and water pollution."
"All the while, we also know Native peoples have served as responsible stewards of our environment and natural resources for millennia."
"So, to create enduring solutions to the climate crisis we must rely on your traditions, your expertise, your knowledge, your history, your leadership."
"Native families and communities continue to face profound threats from the urgent crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous people."
"For centuries Native children were torn away from their families and their communities. These acts were not only violations of basic human rights for those children and their families but also an attack on the very existence of tribal nations."
"As our administration tries to create an America where all have the opportunity to succeed and thrive we will continue to depend on your friendship, on your leadership, and on your partnership. Together we will continue to build a better future for this generation and the generations to come."
That's all from me.
