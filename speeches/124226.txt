Marco Rubio fared best, Ted Cruz underperformed in debate, local GOP panelists say

Alan Furey, an educator who formerly served as chairman of Young Republicans of Huron County, applauded the energy of Rubio's opening statement and said "I like him more and more every time I hear him speak. I'd love to see who he aligns with for VP."
Our local Republicans were particularly impressed by Rubio, and felt he succeeded in portraying Cruz as an opportunist who would say or do anything to win an election.

"Confirms my suspicions that Cruz plays many sides of the fence to achieve his goals," said Joyce Banjac of Broadview Heights, a business school lecturer at Baldwin Wallace University.
