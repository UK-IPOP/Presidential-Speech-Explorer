Accordingly, the Administration supports House passage of H.R. 1278 and urges the House to make significant progress toward resolving the Administration's most serious concerns. Two items are of special concern:

Other issues of strong concern are:

The Administration will continue to work with Congress on an urgent basis to present to the President legislation that will resolve the current crisis and ensure that it is never repeated.
