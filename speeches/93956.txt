 – As part of a new "True Blue Majority" campaign launching this week, today Democratic leaders from Wisconsin held a conference call with reporters, where they discussed their endorsement of Senator John Edwards for president. During the call, the endorsements of more than twenty prominent Wisconsin Party leaders and elected officials were unveiled, including Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Joe Wineke and Wisconsin State Representatives Frank Boyle, Kim Hixson and Josh Zepnick. The new Edwards endorsements build on a list of 17 Wisconsin supporters unveiled earlier this year, including State Treasurer Dawn Marie Sass, Madison Mayor Dave Cieslewicz, former Governor Tony Earl, and Congressman David Obey, Chairman of the U.S. House Appropriations Committee. Edwards has now been endorsed by more than 40 prominent Democratic leaders in the state.
"It is so important that we nominate a candidate who will motivate swing voters in battleground states, like Wisconsin, to support the Democratic Party in 2008," said Wisconsin State Treasurer Dawn Marie Sass. "Poll after poll in the red and battleground states shows Edwards to be the strongest Democratic challenger in a general election match-up with the leading Republicans. Edwards' strength at the top of the ticket will help Democrats not only to take back the White House, but also to maintain and expand our majorities in Congress and state legislatures. And his coattails will help lead Democrats to victory in hundreds of other down-ballot races at the state and local level as well." "We need a leader who can compete anywhere in America and win," said Joe Wineke, Chairman of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin. "Some pundits say that a Democrat can't win in some places in the South, Midwest or West. But they're wrong. The right Democratic presidential nominee – one who shares our values, understands our issues and offers real and bold solutions – can win these states. That candidate is John Edwards."
"The American people are tired of being ignored by the folks in Washington. The people who want real change in this nation don't just live in blue states or in swing states – they live in every state in this country and on every street in America," said Edwards. "I am committed to spreading a message of real change in every single state in this country. As the Democratic nominee, I will go to the places like small towns in Wisconsin that politicians usually ignore, and I will work to get Democrats elected to Congress, governorships and state legislatures all across this country."
