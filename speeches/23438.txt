Ladies and gentlemen:
It's a great honor for me, speaking on behalf of the Congress and the people of the United States, to present this much deserved and rather rare action--award--to Mr. Robert frost.
I suppose in a sense he is disappointed that this was not a more controversial decision by the Congress, but instead was a unanimous one. We are proud of you, Mr. Frost--

Mr. Frost: Both parties!
THE PRESIDENT. What? Both parties--[laughter]--in fact, the only thing, really, that we have been able to agree on since you were here, in a long time.
But I think we are proud of Mr. Frost and his interpretations of what we feel is the best of America. And therefore I present this award to our very good friend.
