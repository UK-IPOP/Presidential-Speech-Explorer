 certain forest lands within the State of Florida have been or may hereafter be acquired by the United States of America under the authority of Sections 6 and 7 of the Act of March 1, 1911, ch. 186, 36 Stat. 961, as amended (U.S.C., Title 16, Secs. 515 and 516); and
 it appears that it would be in the public interest to designate said lands as the Apalachicola National Forest:
, President of the United States of America by virtue of the power vested in me by Section 24 of the Act of March 3, 1891, ch. 561, 26 Stat. 1095, 1103, as amended (U.S.C., Title 16, Sec. 471), and by Section 11 of the said Act of March 1, 1911 (U.S.C., Title 16, Sec. 521), do proclaim that there are hereby reserved and set apart as the Apalachicola National Forest all lands of the United States within the area shown on the diagram hereto attached and made a part hereof, and that all lands therein which may hereafter be acquired by the United States under authority of said Act of March 1, 1911, as amended, shall, upon their acquisition, be reserved and administered as part of said National Forest.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington, this 13th day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-six and of the independence of the United States of America, the one hundred and sixtieth.
