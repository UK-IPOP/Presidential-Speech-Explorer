 Thank you very much. And it's a great honor and privilege—because he's become a friend of mine—to introduce President Erdogan of Turkey. He's running a very difficult part of the world. He's involved very, very strongly, and frankly, he's getting very high marks. And he's also been working with the United States.

We have a great friendship as countries. I think we're right now as close as we have ever been. And a lot of that has to do with the personal relationship.

So, President, thank you very much. It's a great honor to have you in the United States. Thank you.

 Thank you so much, Mr. President. Thank you so much, Mr. President. We are here in New York, in the United States, to attend the General Assembly of the United Nations. And my dear friend, Donald, we are getting together with you as the delegations, and we're going to conduct a bilateral meeting as well, whereby we will be assessing the current relations between the United States and Turkey, as well as we will have the opportunity to discuss the recent regional developments as a whole.

And I would like to once again thank you for this opportunity, and it's great to get together with you.

 Very well. Thank you very much, Mr. President. We appreciate it. Thank you all very much. I appreciate it.



Mr. President, what will your message be—[

Mr. President, are you going to reconcile with the Kurdish issue, do you think?

 We'll be discussing many issues. Many issues.
