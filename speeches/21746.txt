Senator Kennedy listened by radio to Vice President Nixon on "Meet the Press" as he was driven from Santa Monica, Calif., to the airport.
Senator Kennedy agreed today with Mr. Nixon and said that he wished all political debate on the religious issue could be cut off "right now."
"I think we'd all be better off," he added. "How can we improve on the Constitution?"
