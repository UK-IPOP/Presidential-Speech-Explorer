"Every day brings more disappointing news for the middle-class Americans who are struggling in the Obama economy. With millions of Americans out of work and retail sales dropping for the third straight month in June, it's clear the only people who are 'doing fine' are President Obama's allies and donors. Mitt Romney will deliver a new direction for the country that won't put the interests of his political allies above the interests of middle-class families." —Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 "The outlook for the U.S. economy appeared dimmer Monday after a report that Americans spent less at retail businesses for a third straight month in June. The report led some economists to downgrade their estimates for economic growth in the April-June quarter. Many now think the economy grew even less than in the first quarter of the year, when it expanded at a sluggish 1.9 percent annual rate."

 "Retail sales in the U.S. unexpectedly declined for a third straight month in June, a sign limited employment gains are taking a toll on the biggest part of the economy. The 0.5 percent drop followed a 0.2 percent decrease in May, Commerce Department figures showed today in Washington. The decline was worse than the most-pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News survey in which the median projection called for a 0.2 percent rise. The June decrease was broad-based, including car dealers, department stores and gasoline stations." (Alex Kowalski, "Retail Purchases In U.S. Unexpectedly Decreased 0.5% In June,"

 "A weakening job market is sapping households of the confidence and the incomes needed to boost expenditures, which account for about 70 percent of the economy. Without gains in spending at retailers such as Target Corp. and Macy's Inc., the expansion will have a difficult time gaining momentum."

 "More than two years after President Obama took office vowing to banish 'special interests' from his administration, nearly 200 of his biggest donors have landed plum government jobs and advisory posts, won federal contracts worth millions of dollars for their business interests or attended numerous elite White House meetings and social events, an investigation by iWatch News has found."

 "After the election, Gips was put in charge of hiring in the Obama White House, helping to place loyalists and fundraisers in many key positions. Then in mid-2009, the new president named him ambassador to South Africa. Level 3 Communications, in which Gips retained stock, meanwhile received millions of dollars of government stimulus contracts for broadband projects in six states—though Gips said he was 'completely unaware' of the stimulus money."
