The Administration opposes enactment of S. 140, which would increase Federal payments in lieu of taxes (PILT) without indicating the source of additional funding. Increased PILT payments would' be funded at the expense of other important domestic discretionary programs. There is little evidence to indicate that current payment levels are not sufficient to compensate local governments fairly.
