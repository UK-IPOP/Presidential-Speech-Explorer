Hillary Clinton received the endorsements of Democratic Senate Leader Mark Schauer and several state legislators today, illustrating her growing support in Michigan.
"Hillary Clinton understands what Michigan is going through economically, and she'll work with us to make Michigan jobs a priority, not an afterthought," Schauer said. "When the tough times come -- and they will -- she'll make the difficult decisions that must be made. She won't hesitate to tackle a crisis head on because she has the experience and leadership abilities to do it."
