In answer to newspaper reports that the anti-Curry fight in New York City would be discussed with the President by Postmaster General Farley, it was definitely stated today at the White House that the President will take no part whatever in such discussions nor will he in any way allow himself to be drawn into the political controversy between Curry and anti-Curry factions.
Press reports suggesting that Mr. Farley would outline the situation to President Roosevelt and discuss with him the part the National Administration should take in the anti-Curry movement were categorically denied.
It was emphasized that the President will strictly adhere to this "hands-off" policy when and wherever attempts are made to involve him in local political party contests.
