IT IS a pleasure to have you here. I hope you are all enjoying yourselves at the camp. I am sure you are, because by the looks of you, you are getting plenty to eat.
I hope that when you go back home you will carry with you an impression of this country that will be lasting, and that will be pleasant.
It is a pleasure for me to greet you this morning, and in the name of your country; and I hope that you will continue to have a pleasant time while you are here, and when you go back home you will all be successful in your own countries.

Thank you very much.
