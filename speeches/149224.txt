Today, Indonesia, the United States, and the European Union co-hosted an event on the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) on the margins of the G20 Leaders' Summit, in which we reaffirmed our shared commitment to strengthening global partnerships for high-standard investments in sustainable, transparent, and quality infrastructure in low- and middle-income countries. In line with the G20 theme for 2022, "Recover Together, Recover Stronger," the event highlighted ways in which G20 nations are investing together and investing stronger to meet the critical challenges that the world faces today.
Quality infrastructure is critical to countries' development outcomes, global supply chains, economic and national security, and the health and wellbeing of the planet and people around the world. That is why at the June G7 Leaders' Summit in Germany, Leaders launched PGII and announced their intention to mobilize $600 billion for global infrastructure investments by 2027.
Today's side event demonstrated the importance of partnerships in pursuit of quality infrastructure among G20 members. The co-hosts and participants—who included Argentina, Canada, France, Germany, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Senegal, and the United Kingdom—announced new projects and new forms of collaboration in investments in key sectors such as climate and energy transition, digital connectivity, health and health security, education and gender equality, and transportation.
During the event, we also launched the ground-breaking new Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) with President Joko Widodo of Indonesia co-led by the United States and Japan on behalf of the G7 and the International Partnership Group (IPG), including Canada, Denmark, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, and the United Kingdom. This long-term partnership will accelerate Indonesia's just power sector transition, consistent with keeping the 1.5 °C global warming limit within reach, backed by $20 billion in support from public and private sources.
