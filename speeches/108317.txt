A crowd of nearly 800 ignored the rain and made their way to the historic Sottile Theater at the College of Charleston last night to see Newt Gingrich participate in Tim Scott's Presidential Town Hall Series. Rep. Scott has now hosted six contenders for the Republican nomination in a format that uses questions submitted by the voters and moderated by Scott.
