Dear Mr. Chairman:
The American people join me in expressing to you and the Soviet people our deepest sympathy on the tragic death of the three Soviet cosmonauts. The whole world followed the exploits of these courageous explorers of the unknown and shares the anguish of their tragedy. But the achievement of cosmonauts Dobrovolsky, Volkov and Patsayev remains. It will, I am sure, prove to have contributed greatly to the future achievements of the Soviet program for the exploration of space and thus to the widening of man's horizons.

Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
