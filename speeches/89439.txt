 Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced the Romney for President Massachusetts Steering Committee. Led by statewide chairs former Lt. Governor Kerry Healey, The Honorable Jody Dow and The Honorable Ron Kaufman, this group of Massachusetts Republicans will help build Governor Romney's already strong grassroots support in the state.
Announcing the Massachusetts Steering Committee, Governor Romney said, "The people of Massachusetts have always had a powerful and passionate voice in our government. The members of this committee are all leaders dedicated to strengthening our state and our nation. Like we did in the State House, I look forward to working with this team to bring conservative change to Washington."
Massachusetts Steering Committee Co-Chair Kerry Healey added, "As citizens of Massachusetts, every member of this committee can attest to the leadership ability of Governor Romney. We all witnessed as Governor Romney closed a nearly $3 billion budget gap without raising taxes or borrowing money. Working together, we will help Governor Romney in his efforts to bring the same much needed change to Washington."
