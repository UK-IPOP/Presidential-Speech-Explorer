 
During the debate, Joe Biden gave several Delaware shout-outs, including Wilmington's Union Street...
Maybe, I heard this wrong, or misunderstood, but I think he mentioned Katie's restaurant......
Wilmington used to have a Katie's restaurant - way back in the day - and it was in Little Italy, as is Union Street, but I'm almost positive Katie's wasn't on Union Street.
And it hasn't been Katie's in, well, years. Maybe he said Kozy's - as in Kozy Korner?
