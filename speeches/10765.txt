THE PRESIDENT said:
"In signing the Interior Department appropriation bill I wish to express the hope that the provisions asked for from the Congress in the 'furlough plan' and for a limited flexibility in transfer of appropriations within the departments will be authorized. Such measures would enable us to realize the economies provided in the bill with less interruption to the public service and without such serious hardship on numbers of employees."
