THE STATEMENT issued this evening by the Governor of Arkansas does not constitute in my opinion the assurance that he intends to use his full powers as Governor to prevent the obstruction of the orders of the United States District Court. Under the circumstances, the President of the United States has no recourse at the present time except to maintain Federal surveillance of the situation.
I want to commend the Governors representing the Southern Governors Conference for their cooperative attitude at the meeting today. I hope that they will continue their efforts, as will the Federal Government, to bring about a basis for the withdrawal of Federal forces in Little Rock and the orderly carrying out of the orders of the District Court.
