ON BEHALF of my countrymen, I join you in mourning the death of your distinguished predecessor, the former Governor-General.
Canada has lost one of its most honored citizens and the United States, a valued friend. Vincent Massey was a wise and eloquent statesman, and we in the United States were especially honored by his service as the first Minister of Canada.
I extend to you and all Canadians my deepest sympathy.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[ The Honorable Roland Michener, Governor-General of Canada]
