MR. PRESIDENT, on behalf of the people of the United States, and of the government and myself, I bid you a cordial welcome to the United States.
This, of course, is not your first visit to our country. You are no stranger here. But you have demonstrated in your position of great responsibility such great awareness of the principles on which this country was founded--you have been such a great supporter of those principles-that it is a special privilege for me to have this opportunity to renew with you an association and friendship that began back in Panama in 1956.
So, to you and Senora Lemus I say welcome, with the great hope that you will find here an interesting and enjoyable experience, to say nothing of meeting with people who will share with you such views about government and about the dignity of man.
So again--welcome, Mr. President.
