All aspects of the Continuing Resolution presented to the President for signature should be consistent with these criteria.

The Senate Committee version of the Continuing Resolution for FY 1987 is a marked improvement over the Resolution that passed the House. By contrast, the House version, which reduces defense spending, increases domestic spending, and restricts the President's authority to conduct essential national security programs, is altogether unacceptable.

To the maximum extent possible, the Resolution should be kept free of extraneous amendments. We very much hope that Congress will produce a Continuing Resolution the President can approve.
