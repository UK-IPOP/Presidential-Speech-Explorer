Dear Mr. Weil:
The members of the President's Committee on Religion and Welfare in the Armed Forces deserve the thanks of the entire Nation for the work they have accomplished in the approximately two years during which they have been active. I, personally, have been extremely gratified at the splendid way in which the Committee and its staff have carried out their responsibilities.
The work the Committee has done has always been highly valuable. This work takes on increased significance as we face an uncertain future. I am sure that in the future, the Committee's reports and recommendations will provide a storehouse of wisdom from which we will frequently draw guidance on matters affecting the well-being of our military personnel. I regret that the Congress did not see fit to provide the funds which would have enabled your Committee to continue its constructive and important work.
Please extend my good wishes and gratitude to every member of the Committee and its staff for a job well done.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[The Honorable Frank L. Weil, Chairman, The President's Committee on Religion and Welfare in the Armed Forces, Room 1045, Tempo R Building, 4th and Jefferson Drive, S.W. Washington 25, D.C.]
