Excellency:
I deeply appreciate the spirit which prompted your message of yesterday.
As we made clear in the Security Council, the existing threat was created by the secret introduction of offensive weapons into Cuba, and the answer lies in the removal of such weapons.
In your message and your statement to the Security Council last night, you have made certain suggestions and have invited preliminary talks to determine whether satisfactory arrangements can be assured.
Ambassador Stevenson is ready to discuss these arrangements with you.
I can assure you of our desire to reach a satisfactory and peaceful solution of the matter.
JOHN F. KENNEDY
[His Excellency U Thant, Acting Secretary General of the United Nations]
