Good morning, all!

I will be your pooler for today. The sun is out right now in Charleston, South Carolina, but there is a slight chance of rain later today.

The pool was tested this morning for COVID-19. We are holding now to head to Kiawah Island, where President Biden and his family are staying. We will be at the press hold there. The drive to the island is about an hour.

There are no updates to the president's schedule. 


Pool left Charleston around 10:10 am. We arrived to the pool hold on Kiawah Island at 11:05 a.m., where there is a nice view of the ocean. We were briefly held at the entrance to the island.

There are now some gray clouds overhead, but your pooler still saw several folks on a bike ride.

Just FYI, the cell service on the island is spotty. 


There's been no update to POTUS schedule, and the pool has not seen the president today.

The pool will let you know if we get any details on what the president has been up to or if there are any changes to his schedule.

The sun is out now after a brief thunderstorm around 12:45 p.m. that lasted about 10 minutes.


After an uneventful day on Kiawah Island, a lid was called at 3:51 p.m.
