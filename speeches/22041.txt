I HAVE been advised by Secretary of Labor W. Willard Wirtz that both the New York Shipping Association and the International Longshoremen's Association, AFL-CIO, have jointly requested the appointment of a board of neutrals to assist them in their current contract negotiations. Secretary Wirtz has been instructed by me to respond to this joint and voluntary request of the parties.
