 "The announcement yesterday by the magazine executive and former presidential candidate, Steve Forbes, that he is endorsing Mayor Giuliani in 2008 and joining the campaign as a national co-chairman and senior policy adviser, crystallizes for us a feeling that has been germinating for quite some time, that Mr. Giuliani is emerging as the candidate in this race for growth-oriented, economic conservatives — and, for that matter, those who aren't so conservative but comprehend the importance of policies not of managing shortages but of ensuring jobs and growth."
