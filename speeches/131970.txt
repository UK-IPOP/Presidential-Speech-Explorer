 Well, thank you very much. So many familiar faces, Admiral, from the media. They're lovely people and great relationships.

But I'll tell you, this is very special to be in Hawaii and to be visiting very shortly Pearl Harbor, which I've read about, spoken about, heard about, studied, but I haven't seen. And that's going to be very exciting for me in a little while.

So thank you very much, really incredible, and it's been wonderful meeting the folks that you're with. And that's a lot of talent.

Yes, sir. It is.

You have a lot of tough people and a lot of talented people, and we appreciate it.

 Mr. President, it's great to have you here in Hawaii, great to have you here at Camp Smith and Pearl Harbor. And we're all honored to have you on the island.

 Thank you.

. The people here on the island are grateful that you're here.

. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
