Federal aid for vocational education plays an important part in the program of the Democratic Party for accelerating our rate of economic growth. As the skill of our workers increases, the output which they contribute to the economy will also increase. Vocational education brings great increases in the skill of workers. In vocational education, as elsewhere, nothing short of the best will meet the challenge of the 1960's.
I do not believe the Mr. Nixon's tardy commitment to stimulate research and demonstration projects designed to update and strengthen vocational education prograins is adequate in this period of crisis.
I am in favor of continuing the appropriation of Federal funds for vocational education at the full amounts authorized under the various vocational education acts, and where justified, I am in favor of expanding vocational education on a grant-in-aid basis, to be administered by State boards for vocational education.
In the 1959 budget, and again in the 1960 budget, the Republican administration proposed discontinuance of Federal grants for vocational education. The administration endeavored to decrease Federal assistance for training in agriculture, home economics, industrial trades, and in distributive occupations in the 1961 budget. Fortunately, the Democratic Congress did not approve the administration's proposal.
