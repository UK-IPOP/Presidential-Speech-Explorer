Mr. Prime Minister, and Ladies and Gentlemen:
For me there is always a bit of sadness in my heart when I leave this country. I have had many experiences here, in war and peace. I have formed some of the most valued friendships that I have. So, whenever I leave, it is a goodbye that has with it and in it a bit more of sentiment than would seem fitting to express in such a spot and before such a machine as this microphone.
But as I go, I want to say one thing about Anglo-American relationships. We talk often about their warmth and their strength--their health. I would like for all of you to remember, and on our side of the water I should hope that we always remember, the value of these relationships. To my mind, if two nations such as ours, with common traditions and almost a common language, cannot together get basic agreement upon the principles, upon the general road we want to travel as we go side by side into the future, then indeed the future of the world is bleak.
We can, with the other nations of the British Commonwealth--on our side I am sure--do our part to make these things possible, so that all of us can gain the confidence that comes from having by its side a true ally, a true friend, friends that can express their differences without rancor, can discuss difficult questions without personal animosity, and between them find a way to advance the great causes for which we stand.
And so, once more I say goodbye--except that I have a little sneaking ambition for the next weekend where I am going to stop in Scotland. So although this is goodbye to you, sir, and to my friends here, I hope to have in that lovely spot a Saturday and Sunday where I might even get in a round of golf.
Thank you very much, and goodbye.
