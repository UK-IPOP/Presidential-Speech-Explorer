Pool Reports by 
, 
Hi all,
I'm your in-town print pooler today. The president has no public events on his schedule, but we have a coronavirus task force meeting scheduled for 4:30 pm.
No changes to today's schedule as of now. Let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,
As mentioned by yesterday's pooler, reporters are having their temperatures checked again before the 5pm presser. A yellow sticker indicates that a reporter's temperature has been checked.
Just a reminder this briefing is on camera so I will not be sending quotes or updates from it.
White House officials who were checking temperatures asked reporters if they were experiencing a fever, cough or shortness of breath.
Also of note: The coronavirus task force met by conference call today.
The briefing has been pushed back to 5:30 p.m.
We have a two-minute warning on the briefing.
The president left the briefing room at 7:27 p.m. after about an hour and 32 minutes.
He was joined by CDC Director Robert Redfield, FEMA Director Peter Gaynor, Vice President Mike Pence, Surgeon General Jerome Adams and trade adviser Pete Navarro.
We have at travel/photo lid. Enjoy your night.
