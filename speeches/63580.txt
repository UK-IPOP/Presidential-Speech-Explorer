The Administration supports appropriate reforms of the federal securities laws. The goal should be to end litigation abuses and to clarify the law, without improperly limiting the rights of investors to pursue civil actions against financial fraud.

As reported by the Senate Banking Committee, S. 240 contains a number of provisions designed to end litigation abuses which the Administration endorses. A number of its original provisions that had been the-focus of committee discussions have been modified appropriately or deleted. S. 240 is now a substantial improvement on H.R. 1058, which the Administration could not support. For instance, S. 240 rejects certain of H.R. 1058's egregious provisions, such as its "loser-pays" approach and its too-stringent definition of recklessness. At the same time, S. 240 adopts several sensible provisions, including a workable pleading standard taken from the Second Circuit, and appropriate class action reform provisions.

The Administration recommends the following modifications to two provisions in the bill:

The Administration, recommends that the Senate adopt the following measures, which are not included in S. 240:

It should be noted that the Securities and Exchange Commission has expressed many of the same concerns with respect to this legislation. The Administration encourages the Senate to continue to work with the Securities and Exchange Commission to ensure that S. 240 redresses litigation abuses while preserving the ability of investors to bring class-action lawsuits against financial fraud, a legal device that is critical to the maintenance and integrity of our financial markets.



S. 240 could affect receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay- as-you-go (PAYGO) requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. The preliminary OMB PAYGO estimate is zero. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from this estimate.
