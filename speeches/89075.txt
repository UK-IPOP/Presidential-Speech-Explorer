 Clinton: "Well, I want to make clear that there is a difference between having a health care system that provides quality, affordable health care to every American, and having a national health care system where there's only one source of care and the government runs it. That is what's called a single payer system. And the single payer system can be done a variety of ways." (ABC's "Good Morning America," 3/26/07)
 "[Clinton] said that the failure of her proposal for universal coverage in 1994 made her more determined to achieve the goal now. 'It also makes me understand what we are up against,' Mrs. Clinton said. 'We have to modernize and reform the way we deliver health care. But we have to change the way we finance it. That's going to mean taking money away from people who make out really well right now.'" (Robert Pear, "Candidates Outline Ideas For Universal Health Care," The New York Times, 3/25/07)

 "The [Democratic] candidates compete with one another over whose plan is more 'universal,' but nobody ever explains how you 'require' someone to purchase health insurance. This is one of the many virtues of a straight-up socialized-medicine scheme. If we had national health care, you wouldn't have to enroll in a plan.

 "The Health Service may not be able to afford the next generation of cancer drugs, senior doctors have warned. Specialists fear that the NHS will be 'crippled' by the increasing range of breakthrough treatments. Some believe that private health insurance is the only way to fund the most expensive drugs. Their concerns raise the prospect of cancer patients spending thousands to have a chance of survival. Furthermore, if patients pay for their own drugs, many NHS trusts refuse to cover the cost of care." (Daniel Martin, "Cancer Drug Costs 'Will Cripple NHS'," [London] Daily Mail, 5/14/07)
 "One person in eight who is admitted to hospital for non-emergency procedure in Britain has to wait more than a year before being treated. Britain's health minister, Andy Burnham, said the NHS should be 'very proud' that only 48 percent had to wait longer than 18 weeks between being referred by a doctor to the start of their treatment because this was an increase from 35 percent." (Nic Fleming, "Hospitals With A Year-Long Waiting List," The Telegraph, 6/9/07)
 "Over the course of the past decade almost every European country with a national health care system has introduced market-oriented reforms and turned to the private sector to reduce health costs and increase the value, availability, and effectiveness of treatments."
