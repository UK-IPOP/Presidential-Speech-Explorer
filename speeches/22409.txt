THE YEAR 1963 has been a time of fruitful achievement aimed at reaching the objectives set by Congress in the Communications Satellite Act.
The program to establish a global communications satellite system to meet the many objectives of the act is progressing well in light of the complexities of the problem.
An entirely new long-haul communications transmission system is being fitted into the complex technical and organizational arrangements of the growing international communication structure.
These efforts are going forward with ingenuity and determination on the part of the Government, the Corporation, the U.S. international communications carriers and 'telecommunication entities overseas.
The national program of the United States moves forward aggressively toward the fulfillment of the policy and purposes of the Congress.
