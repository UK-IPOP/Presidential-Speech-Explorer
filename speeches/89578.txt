NEVADA -- Hillary Clinton's Nevada Chair Rory Reid today announced the formation of the Nevada African American Leadership Council, a group of African American community leaders from a wide range of personal and professional backgrounds, who are united in support of Hillary Clinton's bid for the presidency. Joining Reid for this morning's teleconference announcement were council representatives Dr. Robert Fowler and Hannah M. Brown.
"Senator Clinton has demonstrated a commitment to protecting civil rights and expanding opportunities for African Americans throughout her career," said Fowler. "She has the experience and vision to break down barriers between us and move our country in the right direction. I am thrilled to be a part of this Leadership Council, dedicated to making Hillary Clinton our next president."
"Hillary has always been an advocate for those without a voice in society," said Brown. "She has championed equal access to education, health care and home ownership - and fought discrimination in all its forms. I know that as President, she will be a leader who gives voice to all of our hopes for a better America."
The Council will serve as a steering committee and advisory body for the campaign on African American community issues and outreach efforts. The wide-ranging group of founding Council members includes educators, business leaders, public service veterans and community activists from across the state.
"The breadth of experience and depth of knowledge assembled in this group of leaders is very exciting for our campaign," said Reid. "Their endorsement is a tribute to Senator Clinton's record of achievement and vision for our country, and their support and expertise will bring immeasurable value to our efforts in Nevada."
