 – As part of a new "True Blue Majority" campaign launching this week, today Georgia Democratic leaders held a press conference to announce their support of John Edwards for president.
"It is so important that we nominate a candidate who will motivate swing voters in battleground states, like Georgia, to support the Democratic Party in 2008," said former Governor Roy Barnes. "Poll after poll in red and battleground states shows Edwards to be the strongest Democratic challenger in a general election match-up with the leading Republicans. Edwards' strength at the top of the ticket will help Democrats not only to take back the White House, but also to maintain and expand our majorities in Congress and state legislatures. And his coattails will help lead Democrats to victory in down-ballot races at the state and local level as well."
"We need a leader who can compete anywhere in America, and win," added Barnes. "Some pundits say that a Democrat can't win in some places in the South, Midwest or West. But they're wrong. The right Democratic presidential nominee – one who shares our values, understands our issues and offers real and bold solutions – can win these states. That candidate is John Edwards."
"The American people are tired of being ignored by the folks in Washington. The people who want real change in this nation don't just live in blue states or in swing states – they live in every state in this country and on every street in America," said Edwards. "I am committed to spreading a message of real change in every single state in this country. As the Democratic nominee, I will go to small towns in Georgia that politicians usually ignore and I will work to get Democrats elected to Congress, governorships and state legislatures all across this country."
