Mr. Ambassador, Mr. Carmichael, Ladies and Gentlemen:
It is indeed a great privilege to speak for the American people in accepting from the German people this product of a German artist and a gift of that entire nation.
We know that twice in our generation our two countries have been at war. What this gift symbolizes in a revolution of thinking--in the erasing of old enmities and a desire to cooperate among ourselves for the peaceful advancement of all nations is going to be meaningful as long as this statue, this work of art, endures.
I think, for myself, I have a particular additional item of satisfaction in that I was, after all, the commander of the great forces from the West that swept over Germany in the most recent war. The fact that I am now privileged as the representative of our country to accept this, with feelings and mutual expressions of peaceful intent and purpose, is something that is very dear to me at this moment.
I hope, Mr. Ambassador, that you will express to President Heuss, and through him to all the people of Germany, the very great satisfaction we shall take in this, not only for its own sake as a great work of art, but because of what it symbolizes in the efforts that both nations and both peoples are now making to do our best to make this a peaceful world.

Thank you very much.
