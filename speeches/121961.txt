 runs piece by former editorial page editor 
 backing Marco Rubio 
â€” Kailani Koenig (@kailanikm) 
No candidate for President has worked harder to understand the most important issues of the day, domestic and foreign, than Marco Rubio, and it shows. Take Obamacare. While all candidates talk about getting rid of it, Marco Rubio is the only one who has actually damaged it. He led the fight to deny extra subsidies for Obamacare exchanges, and the provision he fought for passed into law. As a result, insurers are pulling out of the exchanges because the administration cannot take money from other programs to prop up the failing exchanges.
Republicans want a leader who will get things done, not just talk. Rubio is that leader. What's more, he understands where this country needs to go. Domestically, his opportunity agenda is exactly what the country needs. On foreign policy, no one has a more impressive grasp of the facts and the strategy necessary to enhance our security by reclaiming our position as the leader of the free world. Instead of mouthing platitudes, Rubio has done his homework and is fully prepared to lead this country.
