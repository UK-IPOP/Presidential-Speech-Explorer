My dear Mr. Zukor:
I congratulate you cordially upon acquiring the services of my long time friend and co-laborer, George Akerson, whose ability, personality and loyalty I hold in the highest esteem. He is equally to be congratulated upon the opportunity of such a profitable and congenial association with yourself in your increasingly important field of activity.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
