We have taken the first steps down the pathway to disarmament. Last year saw the test ban treaty, the direct communications link, and the U.N. resolution against nuclear weapons in space. This year both the Soviet Union and the United States have announced reductions in the production of fissionable material for nuclear weapons.
Each of these steps points in the direction of effective control of arms. Each moves us a small way down this long and difficult road.
We must not hesitate now that the journey has been begun. We must redouble our efforts until it is completed.
