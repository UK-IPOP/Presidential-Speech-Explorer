ON MAY 9 press representatives were told that the President hoped to take a month's holiday in the western national parks, beginning August 1. At that time it was anticipated that the work of Congress would be completed at a much earlier date than has now eventuated.
The President will require some time in Washington to complete important matters after the adjournment of the present session. He expects, however, to be able to spend at least 2 weeks in the northern Rockies late in August or early September, solely for purposes of an outdoor holiday and rest.
The President has received a very great number of cordial invitations to make public appearances and addresses in various cities en route. The curtailment of the period when he may be away from Washington, and the very nature of taking a holiday and rest will preclude acceptance of these invitations and he believes they will not be pressed.
