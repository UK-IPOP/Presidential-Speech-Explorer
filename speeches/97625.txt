 The special agents awarded their badges today will write a new chapter in the FBI's storied history with assignments as diverse as the FBI's mission – from dismantling organized crime networks, to pulling the plug on online predators, to making white-collar criminals pay for defrauding hardworking Americans – and they will take their place on the front lines of the war on terror.
 Before 9/11, terrorism was viewed primarily as a criminal matter. Law enforcement focused more on prosecuting terrorists after an attack than on preventing the attack in the first place. For example, after terrorists first targeted the World Trade Center in 1993, FBI agents succeeded in tracking down several of the killers, obtaining indictments against them, and putting them behind bars. But eight years later al Qaida returned to finish the job.
 Over the past seven years, the FBI has more than doubled the number of intelligence analysts and translators on the force. The Patriot Act has helped ensure that FBI analysts and investigators have the information they need to protect our Nation. The FBI established a new National Security Branch – bringing together divisions responsible for intelligence, counterterrorism, and counterespionage.
 Since 9/11, the FBI has worked with our partners around the world to disrupt planned terrorist attacks. Most Americans will never know the full stories of how these attacks were stopped and how many lives were saved.
 Over the past century, the FBI has grown from a small team of 34 investigators to a powerful force of more than 30,000 agents, analysts, and support professionals serving around the world. They have pushed the boundaries of forensic science – from mastering the art of fingerprints to pioneering the use of DNA evidence.
