Operation Iraqi Freedom:
Since September 2001, over 3,000 al-Qaida suspects have been detained in over 90 countries.
In the global war on terrorism, the United States and its allies have:
Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Hong Kong have all been strong partners in the War on Terrorism, arresting dozens of terrorist leaders with al-Qaida ties.
Pakistan has taken into custody more than 500 terrorist suspects, including Ramzi bin al Shibh and Khalid Shaykh Mohammad.
The U.S. is working closely with the Afghan and Pakistani governments to deny sanctuary to terrorists moving into and among their border areas.
The United Kingdom along with Spain, Italy, Germany, France and other European nations have disrupted al-Qaida cells.
Many Middle East and North Africa nations have sought and arrested al-Qaida members.
Since 9/11, the U.S. and other countries have frozen over $137 million, much of which was supporting al-Qaida operations.
We have developed partnerships with both Canada and Mexico to stop illicit border crossings and facilitate legitimate trade and travel.
In the United States, al-Qaida associated cells were dismantled in Buffalo, New York, and Portland, Oregon and arrested individuals charged with supporting the Egyptian-based Al-Gamat Al-Islamiyya.
To improve intelligence sharing and coordination, the President directed the establishment of the Terrorist Threat Integration Center (TTIC), whose partner agencies include CIA, FBI, DHS, DOD, and State.
The FBI established the National Joint Terrorism Task Force and we have expanded FBI-led interagency Joint Terrorism Task Forces investigating terrorist activity around the country to 66.
The Attorney General established the Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force to identify and locate terrorists.
The State Department has developed tamper-resistant visas and new digital passports.
