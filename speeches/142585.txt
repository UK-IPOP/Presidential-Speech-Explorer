EXTERNAL SOURCE Denis McDonough finished the oath as secretary of the VA at 12:23. He was surrounded by his two sons. His wife held what looked like a Bible. VP Kamala Harris administered the oath. They did not answer questions during or after the ceremony, which lasted little more than a minute.
"It happened!" Harris shouted to Mcdonough's daughter Addie, who joined by video phone on a cell. Harris and McDonough waved to the phone.
Harris told Mcdonough's two sons "guys, get in the shot" just before it began.
Among those present:
Kari McDonough (wife)
Liam McDonough (son)
Edward "Teddy" McDonough (son)
(Daughter Addie joined virtually on a White House official's cell phone)
The event took place in the vice president's ceremonial office in the EEOB, the same office used for Secs. Blinken, Mayorkas and Buttigieg.
The ornate room has three gold chandeliers, a large patterned carpet over a wood floor and a long wooden conference table, along with framed wooden ships and framed period paintings. The swearing in took place on the side by an unlit fireplace, a large gold-framed mirror and four flags — two US and two white vice presidential flags.
Small addendum: The White House says the bible McDonough used belonged to his father and still has his notes in it.
