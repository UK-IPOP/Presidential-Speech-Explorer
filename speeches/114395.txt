  LIU: "This is really the time, Leo right, when they start deciding who they are going to go with.  And with a report like this, this makes President Obama's job a whole lot tougher to sell the next four years." (Bloomberg, 9/7/12)
 
 "You had Americans leaving the labor force.  In fact, you've got the labor force shrinking by 368,000.  The number of employed falling by more than the number of employed.  The participation rate, 63.5%.  That is the lowest participation rate we've seen since 1981.  12.5 Million Americans unemployed, according to the household survey.  Again, huge factor hanging over the election." (Bloomberg, 9/7/12)
 "Across the board, this is not a good report when you are coming at it from the perspective of the Federal Reserve. First of all, the revisions to the prior months, we saw July and June revised lower again. June had already previously been revised down. So, the labor force appears to be losing steam, or at least the idea that companies hiring." (Bloomberg, 9/7/12)
 CNBC's BECKY QUICK:  "Yeah, the jobs number today was a disappointment, Chuck. ... If you looked at the unemployment rate, it dropped.  So, there are some who will look at this and say it was decent.  The headline coming out tomorrow morning is that this dropped to 8.1% from 8.3%, but the economists that I talked to, Chuck, said that it's hard to spin this as a positive number." (MSNBC, 9/7/12)
 "All about the labor participation rate and that coming down, which is depressing when you think about it. Fewer people looking for work. Perhaps some staying in school longer because they know there's not a market for jobs. But overall, not a great picture." (CNBC, 9/7/12) 
 QUICK: "You guys were all expecting more jobs across the board." ... SWONK: "The labor force strength, and it was both sides. It was all negative. The labor force shrank along with the participation rate fell." CNBC's STEVE LIESMAN: "There are 250,000 fewer unemployed, so the number of unemployed did fall by 250." QUICK: "Those people just stopped looking for jobs." (CNBC, 9/7/12)
 
 VELSHI: "But this is not the hopeful number that the administration and frankly the country was looking for. I would say that you would have to characterize this as the glass half empty, Soledad." (CNN, 9/7/12)
