I transmit herewith a report by the Secretary of State setting out reasons why the invitation extended by the Government of Italy to that of the United States to participate in two international expositions which, in commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Kingdom of Italy, will be held at Rome and Turin, respectively, in 1911, should be accepted and provision made by Congress to enable the United States fittingly to take part in the expositions.
Deeming international expositions of the comprehensive character of those it is intended to hold in Italy next year to be instructive agencies of the industrial development of the world and important instrumentalities in the advancement of trade relations, I give my cordial approval to the recommendation made by the Secretary of State and urge upon Congress timely provision in accordance therewith.
