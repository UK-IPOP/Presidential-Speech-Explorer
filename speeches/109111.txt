Mitt Romney today announced additional legislative endorsements in Florida. "I am thrilled to have earned the support of so many respected legislators in Florida," said Mitt Romney. "They are champions for the taxpayer, fighting for the middle class that has been hit so hard by President Obama's failed economic policies. Their hard work in Tallahassee will help put many Floridians back to work. I'm excited to work with them to bring my message of reduced spending and fiscal restraint to Washington." "Florida Republicans are getting behind Mitt Romney because he is the one candidate with the leadership experience and conservative solutions to help fix our country's struggling economy," said Florida House Speaker Designate Will Weatherford. "I welcome these legislators who share Mitt Romney's vision for our country's future. They join an already impressive Florida team and I look forward to working with them to elect Mitt Romney and defeat President Obama in November 2012."
