Dear Mr. Postmaster General:
Our Nation has lost one of its most rare and inspiring talents with the passing of Adlai E. Stevenson. In the generation since the Second World War, he touched the lives, the minds, and the hearts of his countrymen as few other Americans have done at any time. He called us to greatness--and we shall never forget either the man or his call.
As Governor, as a national leader, as an international statesman, Adlai Stevenson enlarged our horizons as Americans and helped to light the hopes of mankind all around the world. His place is secure in the hearts of all who knew him and in the history of these times. I believe it is fitting that we pay the honor that we can to this most exceptional man. So, I am, by this letter, requesting that you immediately undertake to develop and issue publicly a commemorative postage stamp appropriate to the life and works of Adlai Ewing Stevenson.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Honorable John A. Gronouski, Postmaster General, Washington, D.C. ]
