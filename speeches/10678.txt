[Released October 27, 1931. Dated October 26, 1931]
EVERY American interested in clean and honest sportsmanship will grieve with you in the death of your father, Charles A. Comiskey. His career coincided with the evolution of baseball into our national sport. His rugged character was reflected in the ideals and standards which he valiantly championed in his responsible connections with the sport. Please accept for yourself and your associates my deep sympathy in your loss.
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Louis Comiskey, Eagle River, Wisconsin]
