(Final-Sent On 7/6/90)



The Administration opposes enactment of H.R. 5064 because it duplicates existing programs already operating in 49 States. Local school districts already can and do support these programs under the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act. In addition, the Department of Justice already supports the training of law enforcement officers who participate in these programs.
