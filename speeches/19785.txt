Dear Mr. Secretary:
I appreciate very much your sending me a copy of your proposed letter to the Chairman of the Surface Transportation Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Interstate and foreign Commerce.
The recommendations made by the Administration to solve the railroad problem and strengthen the transportation industry are in my judgment sound. The soundness of the proposal for temporary financial assistance depends, of course, upon the increased earnings expected to result from the other proposals. Adoption of the former without the latter would, therefore, be quite undesirable.
All the recommendations should be enacted into law with dispatch. hope that no effort will be spared to achieve this result.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
