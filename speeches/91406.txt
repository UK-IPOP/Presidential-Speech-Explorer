The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsements of State Senate Minority Leader Marsha Arzberger and 13 Arizona legislators and community leaders.
"We need a change in Washington, and Hillary Clinton has the experience and knowledge to make it happen," said Senate Minority Leader Marsha Arzberger.
"America has lost its way, and it will take a leader with Hillary Clinton's strength and experience to get us back on track," said Maricopa County Supervisor Mary Rose Garrido Wilcox.
"Hillary Clinton has spent more than three decades advocating on behalf of those who are invisible in America," said former National Council of La Raza President and Campaign Co-Chair Raul Yzaguirre, who endorsed Hillary in April. "Not only is she the most experienced and qualified candidate to be president, Senator Clinton has the ability to bring people together to get results and move this country forward."
"I am honored to have the support of these local leaders who will be critical in spreading our message of change across Arizona and the nation," Clinton said.
