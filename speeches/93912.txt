This week, the Hillary Clinton campaign focused on Women Changing America. The week was a great success, including growing grassroots support, a record breaking fund-raising event, new family-friendly policies and leadership by Hillary on issues important to women.
Meanwhile, President Bush celebrated this week in his own special way: two weeks after vetoing the children's heath bill that would have covered nearly 4 million additional kids, he appointed Susan Orr, an anti-family planning ideologue, to be responsible for overseeing family planning funding at the Department of Health and Human Services. Women know what's at stake in this election!
