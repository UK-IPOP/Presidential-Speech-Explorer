 - Today, the Cruz for President campaign 
 Donald Trump's long history of helping to elect some of the most liberal Democrat office holders as well as contributing heavily to the Democrat machine in New York. Several liberal politicians who have benefited from Trump's contributions have gone on to commit ethics violations, resign in disgrace, or serve time in prison.
"Donald Trump has supported the Democrat politicians who have made it difficult for average Americans to get ahead," said presidential candidate Ted Cruz. "I have met a number of hard-working New Yorkers who are excited that they finally have a true conservative on the ballot to vote for. Trump's record of electing Democrats proves he's not being truthful about what he says he supports and what he claims he'll do. The real Donald Trump is a Democrat and should not be our Party's nominee."


Trump has contributed to New York Rep. Charlie Rangel and floated his name as a potential Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. But in 2010, 333 of Rangel's colleagues voted to censure him for eleven violations of House ethics restrictions and other federal rules.
In addition:
It should come as no shock that Donald Trump would be a financier of Democrats and the Democratic Party because he's long held controversial liberal positions. He has called himself "very pro-choice," has previously supported banning popular guns, advocates for government-funded universal health care, said he's a "big fan" of the United Nations, hires illegal labor for his construction jobs, and defends importing cheap foreign labor to work at his country clubs. Donald even supported John Kerry over George W. Bush, and called for President Bush's impeachment.
Donald Trump is no Republican and he's certainly no conservative. His long record of contributing, helping, and electing liberal and corrupt Democrats should disqualify him as our party's nominee for the Presidency of the United States.
