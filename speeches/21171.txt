Senator KENNEDY. Ladies and gentleman, I want to thank you for coming out here and showing that we believe in the Democratic Party and in progress. I stand here tonight where Franklin Roosevelt stood when he caused this country to move forward in the 1930's, and I call upon you to join us in moving this State and country forward in the 1960's. [Applause.] We believe in the cause of freedom, we believe in a strong and growing country, we don't believe in standing still. We believe that in 1960 and 1961 this country is going to pick itself up and start forward on the road again, and I ask you for your help. [Applause.]
The next President of the United States will carry New York. I come here tonight to the heart of a great Democratic section of old Brooklyn and ask your help. [Applause.]
Now, if you can tell us where there is some place to eat, we will go and eat. Thank you. [Applause and laughter.]
