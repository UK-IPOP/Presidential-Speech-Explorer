, Susan B Anthony List president Majorie Dannenfelser, applauded his efforts, 

"Mr. Graham, of South Carolina, said his Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act would put the U.S. on the 'right side of history' in the long-running debate over abortion." (Tom Howell Jr., "Lindsey Graham files bill to ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy,"

"There are only seven countries that allow wholesale abortions at the 20-week period including China and North Korea," said Mr. Graham, who is running for president. "The United States should not be in that club."

"To become law, the GOP-driven legislation would have to overcome a likely Democratic filibuster in the Senate and to get by President Obama, who has vowed a veto, saying the bill restricts women's choices at a difficult time for them...'I have no doubt the legislation will one day be passed by Congress and signed into law,' he said."

"Graham said Wednesday the Senate should debate the proposal even though it may not gain enough support to overcome a likely presidential veto. 'I want to make the American people think long and hard about wholesale abortions at 20 weeks,' the South Carolina senator said at a Capitol Hill press conference with leaders of several anti-abortion organizations."
