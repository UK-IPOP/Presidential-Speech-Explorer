Dear Mr. Harrison:
I have your letter of September 2nd, tendering your resignation as a member of the Federal Farm Loan Board, which I accept, as you request, effective at the close of September 15, 1931. I take this action with very sincere regret and cannot let the occasion pass without expressing my appreciation of your long and notable public service, first in the Department of Agriculture and later as a member of the Board of Directors of the War Finance Corporation, and a member of the Federal Farm Loan Board. In positions of large responsibility you have displayed fine capacity for efficient administration and it is my pleasure to say that the ability, energy and devotion to the public interest which you have manifested in the discharge of every duty are worthy of the highest commendation. As you leave the Farm Loan Board, you carry with you my best wishes for success in the new work which you are about to undertake in the Federal Reserve System.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Honorable Floyd R. Harrison, Federal Farm Loan Bureau, Washington, D.C.]
