The Speaker of the House of Representatives:
SIR: Pursuant to the provisions of the Second Deficiency Appropriation Act, 1945, and the Military Appropriation Act, 1946, I have the honor to transmit herewith for the consideration of Congress proposed rescissions and provisions as set forth in the letter of the Director of the Bureau of the Budget in whose comments and observations thereon I concur.
These recommendations are the result of the continuous review of the war and war-related appropriations and authorizations which I indicated in my previous recommendations would be made. There is need for further efforts in this direction and I have directed that the review be continued.
The amounts here recommended for rescission, together with those set forth in the enrolled bill, H.R. 4407, are being placed in a nonexpendable status, pending the enactment of legislation.

Respectfully yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
