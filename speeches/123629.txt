Republicans can't afford to forfeit this race to Hillary Clinton by nominating the wrong candidate.Â I'm endorsing Marco Rubio because he has all the ingredients for a winning campaign: inspiration, judgement, and vision. He can be trusted to deliver real results once he is in office. Most important of all for me, Marco has a thorough knowledge of foreign policy and fully understands the true nature of the terrorist threat.
