Well played, Abbi and Ilana.
In the latest episode of Comedy Central's "Broad City,"?a show about a best-friend duo navigating post-college life in New York, Ilana Glazer's character spends the day volunteering for Hillary Clinton's campaign. On her way out the door, she and her best friend, Abbi, run into a surprise guest.
The episode wasn't actually filmed at campaign headquarters in Brooklyn—but the show's producers certainly captured the office vibe. Here's what they got right (and wrong).
The "H" wall featured in last night's episode is a dead ringer for the one at HQ—right down to the Post-its.
What's on the Post-its? Dozens of handwritten reminders from staffers and visitors about the things we're fighting for.
Filing cabinets double as standing desks, and the hallways are pop-up conference rooms.
What can we say? The hours are long.
