Mitt Romney today announced the endorsements of current and former elected officials in Georgia.
"I am pleased to receive the endorsements of so many great leaders in Georgia," said Mitt Romney. "I look forward to working with these leaders to reverse the failed policies of the Obama administration, put Americans back to work, and get the economy turned around."
"Georgians are suffering under the leadership of President Obama. Mitt Romney is the candidate with the vision and experience to turn around the failing economy," said House Majority Whip Edward Lindsey. "As governor, he balanced the budget without raising taxes and created jobs. He has the experience in both the private and public sectors to get Americans back to work."
Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens has also endorsed Governor Romney.
