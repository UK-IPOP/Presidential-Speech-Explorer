WASHINGTON, DC – After months of negotiation, the United States, along with 14 states and a tribal government, have reached an agreement with Old General Motors (now know as Motors Liquidation Company or MLC) to establish a trust to cleanup and repurpose 89 properties left behind in the GM bankruptcy. Under this agreement, Old GM will commit $773 million to cleaning up property sites – two thirds of which are known to be contaminated with hazardous waste – in fourteen states (state by state breakdown below).
This kind of environmental trust is unprecedented in size, speed of settlement, and level of local involvement. It will give local communities the opportunity to participate in designing the strategy for repurposing these properties in accordance with their specific development objectives, using these funds to both properly clean them up and quickly return them to productive use creating jobs and restoring communities. The Agreement was filed with the bankruptcy court that is overseeing the final dissolution of Old GM. It is expected that final approval will take place early next year.
 said of the trust: "We're happy to have a path forward that addresses the needs of former auto communities. This trust ? the largest environmental trust in our history ? provides support for aggressive environmental cleanups at these sites, which will create jobs today and benefit the environment and human health over the long-term."
 highlighted the trust's impact on local community development: "These funds will create much-needed jobs in the communities directly affected by the General Motors restructuring. This trust will create jobs not only through the direct hiring of clean up personnel, but also by generating private investment through locally-driven solutions that repurpose the sites toward new productive uses."
"This settlement holds accountable those responsible for contaminating certain properties and ensures they help transform these communities by supporting the necessary cleanup," said 
 "The agreement marks a new beginning by responsibly addressing hazardous waste contamination in impacted communities, and at the same time creates jobs to help clean up and return these sites to beneficial uses. It also shows how the federal government can work successfully in concert with states and tribes to resolve environmental legacy issues in their communities."
