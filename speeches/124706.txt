Marco Rubio is the next generation leader America needs in the White House. As president, Marco Rubio will help Iowa farmers by rolling back job-killing EPA overreach. He knows outdated Washington red tape harms our economy and has a plan to empower farmers, not unelected bureaucrats.
I support Marco Rubio for president because he has a deep understanding of the issues facing agriculture in the 21st century and how Washington's burdensome regulations impact Iowa agriculture. Marco Rubio's pro-growth, pro-family tax reform allows Iowans to  invest and grow their businesses, not turn them over to the government.
As president, Marco Rubio will be a consistent defender of Iowa farmers and agriculture. Unlike other candidates, Marco Rubio will not change his position based on what audience he is talking to, what state he is in, or which way the polling is swinging. It is important to have a principled, conservative president who supports farming and that's why I am for Marco Rubio.
