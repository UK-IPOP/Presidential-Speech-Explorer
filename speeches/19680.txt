AT THE REQUEST of Governor Faubus of Arkansas I met with him this morning in a constructive discussion regarding the carrying out of the orders of the Federal Court in the matter of the high schools of Little Rock.
The Governor stated his intention to respect the decisions of the United States District Court and to give his full cooperation in carrying out his responsibilities in respect to these decisions. In so doing, I recognize the inescapable responsibility resting upon the Governor to preserve law and order in his state.
I am gratified by his constructive and cooperative attitude at our meeting. I have assured the Governor of the cooperation of Federal officials. I was pleased to hear from the Governor of the progress already made in the elimination of segregation in other activities in the State of Arkansas.
I am sure it is the desire of the Governor not only to observe the supreme law of the land but to use the influence of his office in orderly progress of the plans which are already the subject of the order of the Court.
