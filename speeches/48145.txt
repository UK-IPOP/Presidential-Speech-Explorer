The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 4151 but will work in the Senate and in Conference to modify a number of the bill's provisions.

The major areas requiring modification involve:


— deletion of section 509, regarding restrictions on certain exports to countries supporting terrorism, since (1) existing legislation already provides ample authority for controlling such exports to terrorist-supporting countries and (2) it is Administration policy not to approve license applications for the export of military or dual use items that would make a significant contribution to the military capabilities of terrorist supporting countries;

— deletion from title IX of the unnecessary authorities and the authorization of appropriations for the Coast Guard, which are basically duplicative of existing Coast Guard authority and operations;

— deletion or amendment of certain provisions regarding international nuclear terrorism that are unnecessary or counterproductive; and

— combination into one annual report by the Secretary of State to the Congress of all but one group of the numerous reporting requirements scattered throughout the bill.
