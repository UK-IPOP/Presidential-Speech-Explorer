 â€“ Inspired by the enthusiasm generated by Senator John Edwards' discussion of economic issues during the Des Moines Register debate on Thursday, today the campaign unveiled a second new television ad in Iowa called "Fight."
"The moral test of our generation is whether we're going to allow this broken system to go on without a fight or take on corporate greed and stand up for the middle class and American jobs before it's too late," Edwards says in the ad. "They aren't going to just give their power away. Saving the middle class is going to be an epic battle, and that's a fight I was born for."

This isn't about petty politics or good intentions.
Corporate greed and influence in Washington are stealing our children's future.
The moral test of our generation is whether we're going to allow this broken system to go on without a fight or take on corporate greed and stand up for the middle class and American jobs before it's too late.
They aren't going to just give their power away.
Saving the middle class is going to be an epic battle, and that's a fight I was born for.
I'm John Edwards, and I approved this message.
