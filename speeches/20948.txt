TODAY the Polaris submarine U.S.S. George Washington leaves the United States for the high seas. It will be the first of its kind to become operational and inaugurates a new technique of deterrence. Roving and hidden under the seas with 16 thermonuclear missiles apiece, the George Washington and her following sisterships possess a power and relative invulnerability which will make suicidal any attempt by an aggressor to attack the free world by surprise. The George Washington, the Patrick Henry, the Abraham Lincoln and other Polaris submarines will perform a service to world peace worthy of the great American names they bear.
