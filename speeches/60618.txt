The Administration supports S. 349.



S. 349 would increase receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is that it would increase receipts by less than $500,000 annually. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from this estimate.
