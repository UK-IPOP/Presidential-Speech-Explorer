Well, it is a—what a great, great pleasure, Mr. President, to welcome you to Cornwall.
 It is a great pleasure to be here.
Fantastic to see you. Fantastic to see you here on what I think is your first big overseas trip since you've been——
 It is.
——since you've been President.
 It is. I've visited your great country many times, but this is the first time as President of the United States.
Well, everybody is——
 It's a great honor.
 Everybody is absolutely thrilled to see you. And——
 We're thrilled to be here. I'm thrilled to meet your wife.
 Yes, well—and they've gone off to do something else. [

Are we going to—are we going to have a—we could just continue——
Mr. President, Mr. President——
 I think we generally—I was going to say, we generally agree, Joe. The problem—[

Mr. President, do you—Mr. President, do you see it as a test that Vladimir Putin has banned Alexei Navalny's political organization?
 Thanks, everybody.
Will you resume travel—sir, will you resume travel between the U.K. and the U.S.? Can the Good Friday accord be saved, sir?
