My dear Admiral Hughes:
I have your letter of September 15th tendering your resignation as Chief of Naval Operations, to take effect on the 17th of September. The reasons for this action, which you have explained so fully in your letter, seem sound and most praiseworthy. Therefore, I feel compelled to accept your resignation.
During your service in the Navy you have successfully commanded all units of the fleet, culminating in the present highest office offered by the Navy, from which you now feel it your duty to resign. I wish to express my appreciation of the splendid services you have performed, and also the conviction that your resignation will be received with deep regret, not only from the Naval Service, but from the country as a whole.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[C. F. Hughes, Admiral, United States Navy]
