The House Republicans introduced a bill last night, The Spending Reduction Act of 2012, that would negatively impact the American people in several ways. Let's take a quick look:

The bill also advances Rep. Paul Ryan's approach to domestic discretionary spending, cutting the discretionary cap level far below the bipartisan Budget Control Act total for 2013. The Ryan Budget approach would ultimately impose deep cuts on federal support for education, scientific and medical research, clean energy programs, key infrastructure investments, public safety protections, women's and public health programs, and critical services for families in need.

This bill is a step backwards and it's nothing more than a dangerous diversion.

There's a big, balanced deal on the table that the Speaker should take. It's reasonable, and it meets them more them halfway. This bipartisan deal reduces the deficit in a balanced way that is consistent with our values and lays the foundation for middle class job growth. That means certainty for businesses so they can plan around their strategic growth objectives. That means that everyone, including millionaires and billionaires, does their fair share. That means security for middle class families. And that means our government lives within its means and doesn't mortgage our children's future. It's time for Speaker Boehner to come to the table and take action that'll benefit the American people.
