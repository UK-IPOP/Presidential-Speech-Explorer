For the purpose of encouraging and strengthening social and economic cooperation between the United States of America and its possessions and bases in the area known geographically and politically as the Caribbean, and the United Kingdom and the British colonies in the same area, and to avoid unnecessary duplication of research in these fields, a Commission, to be known as the Anglo-American Caribbean Commission, has been jointly created by the two Governments. The Commission will consist of six members; three from each country, to be appointed respectively by the President of the United States and His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdomâ€”who will designate one member from each country as Co-Chairman.
Members of the Commission will concern themselves primarily with matters pertaining to labor, agriculture, housing, health, education, social welfare, finance, economics, and related subjects in the territories under the British and United States flags within this territory, and on these matters will advise their respective Governments.
The Anglo-American Caribbean Commission in its studies and in the formulation of its recommendations will necessarily bear in mind the desirability of close cooperation in social and economic matters between all regions adjacent to the Caribbean.
