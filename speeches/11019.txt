THE PRESIDENT said:
"I am submitting the protocols of the World Court to the Senate at the forthcoming session. I, of course, have hoped that it would be dealt with at this time. It is for the leaders of the Senate, however, to determine if it should be brought up in the press of other business during the short session. Certainly it should not be made an instrument of obstruction in attempts to force an extra session. Both its friends and foes should agree upon this."
