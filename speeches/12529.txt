 certain public lands in the State of Utah contain narrow canyons displaying evidence of ancient sand dune deposits of unusual scientific value, and have situated thereon various other objects of geological and scientific interest; and
 it appears that it would be in the public interest to reserve such lands as a national monument, to be known as the Capitol Reef National Monument:
, President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 2 of the act of June 9, 1906, ch. 3060, 34 Stat. 225 (U.S.C., title 16, sec. 431), do proclaim that, subject to all valid existing rights, the following-described lands in Utah are hereby reserved from all forms of appropriation under the public-land laws and set apart as the Capitol Reef National Monument:
