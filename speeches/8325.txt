[Released October 11, 1929. Dated October 10, 1929]
I HAVE received Your Excellency's message in connection with the Pulaski Sesquicentennial Celebration now being held in this country. The memory of this young Polish nobleman who joined the forces of the American Colonists and fought so heroically and courageously from the time he was welcomed into General Washington's staff until mortally wounded in the siege of Savannah, will always be cherished in the [p.324] hearts of American citizens and their heartfelt appreciation of his signal service in acquiring American independence will never die.
I shall be happy to greet Your Excellency's distinguished delegation and through them to assure Your Excellency of my country's gratitude and friendship for Poland.
HERBERT HOOVER
