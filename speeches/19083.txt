General de Gaulle, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I must tell you, Mr. President, that my heart is warmed by your very complimentary references to me, and more particularly to my country. I am delighted to be back in Paris. Indeed, there is an old saying in my country that for every American France is a second home. And certainly I feel at home in this country.
I am particularly delighted at the opportunity to have some conversations with my old friend and colleague General de Gaulle. He was, during the dark days of war, when freedom itself was at stake, he was the symbol of French courage, defiance, and dedication to those principles of peace and freedom.
Now we have an opportunity, in these troublous times, to talk together to see whether we can better concert all of our efforts toward the one single goal of peace with justice.
So again I say, thank you for your welcome, General de Gaulle, and my assurances that we will find ways to make our common efforts more effective.
Thank you very much, sir.
