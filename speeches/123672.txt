A new poll this morning shows John Kasich in a statistical tie with Donald Trump in Ohio. Meanwhile, Senator Rubio is significantly behind Trump in Florida.
As the polling data below shows, Rubio is losing to Trump by 26 points. Even if every single Bush supporter went for Rubio, he would still be down by 17 points in his own home state.
In the same poll, more conservatives say they would absolutely not support Senators Cruz and Rubio than they would John Kasich.
Additionally, Kasich's favorability from tea party conservatives is on par with Cruz and better than Rubio, while Kasich dominates among "somewhat conservative" and "moderate" voters.
Winning the nomination requires a candidate who is in a strong position to carry the state that knows them best, and Kasich is in a far better position to do that than Senator Rubio.
