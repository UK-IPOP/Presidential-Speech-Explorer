My dear Mr. Justice:
I am most appreciative of your courtesy in giving me advance notice of your intention to retire from active service on February 25, 1957.
In accepting your resignation from active work as a Supreme Court Justice, I seize the opportunity to tender my congratulations on your long and splendid record in public service, as well as official appreciation of the dedication and devotion that are so much a part of your reputation. You have occupied your important position during many of the most stirring years of our national history and have consequently participated in some of the Court's important decisions. These will, of course, influence our nation's development for a long time to come.
In view of your intention to remain here in Washington where you and Mrs. Reed have formed so many friendships over the years, I am sure that there lie ahead of you long happiness and satisfaction as well as opportunity to continue to contribute to the richness of American life, even though you may do so in a less formal way.
With my greetings to Mrs. Reed and warm regard to yourself,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
