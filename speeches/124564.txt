I'm proud to endorse Marco Rubio today as our nation's next President. After watching last night's debate, my mind is made up that Marco is the conservative leader to lead our country's economy in the 21st century. Marco gives us the best chance of both winning in November and delivering meaningful change to a broken Washington.  

He is an ardent reformer of the status quo, who has demonstrated his ability to take on Washington special interests by scoring a victory in defunding the insurance bailout provisions of ObamaCare. His commitment to limited government and helping states like New Hampshire break free from overarching federal mandates, rules and regulation shows that he's not just worried about the next election, but our next generation.

Marco has the vision, judgment and experience to keep our country and our families safe as our next President.  As every debate has shown, Marco is smart, tested and tough, and ready to take action and get results on Day one.  He is the leader our Party can unite behind, and I look forward to working closely with him in the weeks ahead.
