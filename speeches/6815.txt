At the residence of Mr. Ansley Wilcox, 641 Delaware Avenue, Buffalo, N.Y., Mr. Root stepped forward and said, with deep emotion: "Mr. Vice-President, I have been requested on behalf of the Cabinet of the late president--at least those who are present in Buffalo, all except two--to request that for reasons of weight affecting the affairs of Government you should proceed to take the constitutional oath of President of the United States."
THE VICE-PRESIDENT'S REPLY.
"I shall take the oath at once in accordance with your request, and in this hour of deep and terrible national bereavement I wish to state that it shall be my aim to continue absolutely unbroken the policy of President McKinley for the peace and prosperity and honor of our beloved country."
