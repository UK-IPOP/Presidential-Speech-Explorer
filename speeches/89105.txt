 â€“ Today, MoveOn.org Political Action announced that Senator John Edwards won their poll asking which candidate has the best position to halt global warming. Edwards has detailed an aggressive plan to fight global warming and create a new energy economy in our country. This Friday in Iowa, Edwards will outline his "Green Collar Jobs" initiative to train workers to participate in the new energy economy. Edwards won the poll in a landslide receiving 33 percent of the vote from more than 100,000 MoveOn members. The next closest candidates received 15 percent of the vote.
"John Edwards is very happy that MoveOn members share his passion for solving the global warming crisis and building a new energy economy that creates new green collar jobs," said Campaign Manager David Bonior. "It's exciting to see such a strong, positive reaction to his call for Americans to be patriotic about something other than war, and he is looking forward to partnering with MoveOn members and all Americans to turn this plan into reality."
MoveOn held 1,300 virtual town halls across the country last Saturday for members to learn about the candidates' plans to fight global warming. Members were asked to vote in the poll which asked, "Which candidate's position on dealing with the climate crisis do you prefer?" MoveOn is running ads in Iowa and New Hampshire newspapers next week announcing the results of the poll.
