 the phrase "when carrying passengers and cargo" contained in paragraph numbered 1 in Proclamation No. 2247 of August 25, 1937, prescribing Panama Canal toll rates was intended to read "when carrying passengers or cargo"; and
 it is desired to correct the said phrase so that it shall read as intended:
, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 411 of title 2 of the Canal Zone Code, approved June 19, 1934, do hereby amend the aforesaid paragraph numbered 1 of Proclamation No. 2247 of August 25, 1937, to read as follows:
"1. On merchant vessels, yachts, army and navy transports, colliers, hospital ships, and supply ships, when carrying passengers or cargo, ninety (90) cents per net-vessel ton of 100 cubic feet each of actual earning capacityâ€”that is, the net tonnage determined in accordance with the Rules for the Measurement of Vessels for the Panama Canal."
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 31th day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-second.
FRANKLIN D ROOSEVELT
By the President:
