Buenos días from Mexico City, where the high for today is 70 degrees.
I'll be your print pooler for today's summit events and travel back to Washington D.C., so please feel free to reach out with any questions. As a reminder, Mexico City is an hour behind D.C.
Pool is gathering for sweeps.
Here's today's schedule:
Clarification for the 3:45 pm statements from the three leaders: It will now be a one plus one plus one, meaning there will now be one question from one reporter from each country.

Next stop: the National Palace.
After a bumpy ride, the motorcade arrived at the National Palace at 11:55 am.
Many people lined the route of the motorcade, taking videos and photos. Pool spotted some protestors being blocked by authorities but could not tell what their signs said.
Per WH, Biden and Trudeau bilateral concluded at 11:21 AM
Pool was ushered into the National Palace where President Biden, Mexican President Lopez Obrador and Prime Minister Trudeau posed for a photo.
The three leaders were initially joined by their spouses, First Lady Jill Biden, Dr. Beatriz Gutiérrez Müller and Sophie Grégoire Trudeau for a photo. The three spouses then stepped off to the side as the three leaders took a photo.
The three spouses were seen chatting off to the side as Biden, AMLO and Trudeau took the family photo.

Pool and other credentialed press are currently waiting for the press conference to start.
There are three podiums set on a small stage in a courtyard at the palace. There are two sets of US, Mexico and Canadian flags on the stage behind the podiums.
Flags from each country line the walls of the courtyard.
I will send 2 min warning if we get one.
FYI cell service is spotty.
Apologies for a delayed report. Pool report #13 got stuck in my outbox because there was no data service in the courtyard where the press conference was.
The press conference ended at 6:15 pm. Biden, Lopez Obrador and Trudeau stood for a photo afterwards. Additional questions were shouted at Biden on classified documents, but the president did not respond.
Some color from the press conference below.
Biden, Lopez Obrador and Trudeau came down a grand staircase together at 5:01 pm. Forming a triangular shape, Biden and Trudeau walked parallel to each other while AMLO trailed the US and Canadian leaders. A huge Diego Rivera mural is painted on the wall where the staircase was.
AMLO stood at the center podium, while Biden stood on the Mexican president's right side and Trudeau on the left side.
The remarks were livestreamed.
Prepared remarks for the leaders ended at 5:29 pm.
Q&A began at 5:30 pm.
Biden was asked about his classified documents, to which he said he was "surprised to learn" of the documents and that he is "cooperating fully."

Marine 1 flew in over the Jefferson Memorial and settled onto the White House South Lawn at 0002 on a cold-but-not-frigid January night.
President Biden, accompanied by First Lady Jill Biden, he in his suit, she in jeans, stepped off the helicopter at 0004. The couple walked across the grass and into the residence a minute later.
He did not engage with the pool.
At 0006, the White House declared a lid for the night.
Bonne nuit a tous.
