THE GOVERNMENTS of the United States, Great Britain and France have been in consultation with the view of holding an informal high level meeting. We have agreed that such a meeting is desirable at a date convenient to all of us. A primary purpose will be further to develop common viewpoints with these friends on the many problems that must be solved cooperatively so that the cause of world peace may be advanced.
