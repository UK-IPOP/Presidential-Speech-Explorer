I AM most pleased to learn of the success of the American expedition on Mount Everest. These American climbers pushing human endurance and experience to their farthest frontiers join the distinguished group of British and Swiss mountaineers who have performed this feat. I know that all Americans will join me in saluting our gallant countrymen.
