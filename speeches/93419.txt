 "As Mayor of New York in the 1990s, when undocumented immigrants were pouring into the city, Rudolph W. Giuliani extolled their contributions to the Big Apple's burgeoning economy, forbade city workers from denying them social services and benefits, 
, and grasped the plain fact that they would never be deported en masse." (Editorial, "A Flip That's Flopped,"

 "Mayor Giuliani is actually suing the federal government to be relieved of the requirement that city workers turn over information about illegal immigrants to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. At City University, undocumented aliens qualify for the low resident tuition if they've lived here for a year.

 "CUNY, whose mission has long been to educate poor people, including immigrants, said it did not know how many illegal immigrants were enrolled this year. But last year, 2,788 out of the nearly 200,000 CUNY students identified themselves that way. Since CUNY does not require proof of a student's status, it does not know how many of its other students are in the United States illegally." (Karen W.
