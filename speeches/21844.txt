Vice President NIXON. This is the first time I have been in the throne room and received such a welcome as this. My wife, Pat, and I will carry it with us all the days of our lives.
We have been in many countries and many places around the world but none will remain in our minds and in our hearts more than this, and I can only say, hearing you sing makes me think that everybody in Hawaii has a beautiful voice.
I only hope that we can carry the music of Hawaii in our hearts as we travel throughout the United States and throughout the world because that spirit of music through which you convey your feeling of affection and friendship for those who come among you is something that the world needs, and for that we thank you.
We thank you from our hearts.
