APOLLO 14's successful landing on the moon was a thrilling event for humanity. I congratulate the astronauts and also the thousands of other dedicated people who helped make this awesome achievement possible.
I join with all Americans in wishing the astronauts well as they carry out their mission on the moon and wish them Godspeed for a safe and successful return to earth.
