His Excellency

Amintore Fanfani

President of the Council of Ministers

of the Republic of Italy
I greatly appreciate your most cordial message on the successful voyage of the Nautilus. Our sincere hope is that this voyage will have opened a new avenue for world trade and communication which will serve to promote not only the closer association of the nations of the world, but also the well-being of then' peoples. The congratulations of the Italian people whose captains of the sea figured so prominently in the discovery of America are particularly gratifying.
