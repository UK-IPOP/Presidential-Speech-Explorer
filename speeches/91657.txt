Thompson understands mainstream conservative's view about the problem of illegal immigration in America and their frustration that government can't seem to get the most basic responsibilities right for its citizens.
"Most Americans know that we have an illegal immigration problem in this country, with perhaps as many as 20 million people residing here unlawfully.

"Is it any wonder that a lot of folks today feel like they're being sold a phony bill of goods on border security? A 'comprehensive' plan doesn't mean much if the government can't accomplish one of its most basic responsibilities for its citizens - securing its borders.
