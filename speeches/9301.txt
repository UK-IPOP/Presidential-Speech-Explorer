My dear Mr. Deutsch:
I am glad to learn of the honor to be paid to Mr. Louis Lipsky at a testimonal dinner on November 16th, and I will be obliged if you will express my cordial congratulations to him and my deep appreciation of his long and valuable service to the development of the Jewish cultural life of America.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
