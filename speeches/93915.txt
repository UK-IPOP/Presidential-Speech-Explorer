The Western United States. The fastest growing region in the country. The largest number of new immigrants. Home to Las Vegas, Silicon Valley, Napa Valley, Hollywood and our largest national parks, the source of most of America's fruit, beef and wine and much of our oil, land of dot-coms, ranches and retirement communities - rapidly becoming the most diverse part of America.
Hillary Country.
Hillary has generated excitement in Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, Washington, California and across the West, where she's given thousands of supporters the chance to see her up close. And the endorsements keep rolling in: former Washington Governor Gary Locke, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, California Assembly Speaker Fabian NuÃ±ez, Colorado House Speaker Andrew Romanoff, California Senator Dianne Feinstein, Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums, former Denver Mayor Wellington Webb, California Controller John Chiang, as well as Arizonan Raul Yzaguirre, former president of the National Council of La Raza, the leading Hispanic advocacy organization in the country.
Nowhere is Hillary's Western strength more evident than in Nevada, where a recent poll shows her breaking 50% in the primary and leading by 37 points.
And her support among local leaders only continues to grow, including: Clark County Commissioner Rory Reid, former Governor Bob Miller, Senate Minority Leader Dina Titus, former Las Vegas Mayor Jan Jones, State Treasurer Kate Marshall, Assembly Majority Leader John Oceguera, Dr. Robert Fowler, Clark County Commissioner Chris Giunchigliani, former Attorney General Frankie Sue Del Papa, Las Vegas Latin Chamber of Commerce Chairman Robert Gomez and Reno-Sparks Indian Colony Chairman Arlan Menendez..
This summer, Hillary has drawn huge crowds across the Silver State, including 3,500 in Reno, more than 3,000 in Las Vegas and even 2,500 in rural Pahrump—where she's opened a regional field office.
The Clinton campaign has brought the Hillary tour to most of the Western states, and has a strong on-the-ground presence with offices, field organizers, and thousands of volunteers spanning the region.
And the West is turning out to be a stronger region for Hillary Clinton than anyone anticipated.
Hillary leads the Democratic primary by more than 20 points in the West, with an overwhelming lead in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington.
Hillary leads the Democratic primary by more than 30 points among Latinos, more than 40 points among women, more than 20 points among men, more than thirty points among whites and more than 10 points among African-Americans. She also wins among urban, suburban and rural voters.
Hillary is winning the general election in New Mexico, a state which Bush won in 2004, and in California, Oregon and Washington.
Together with Hawaii, this means Hillary Clinton is starting with two-thirds of the electoral votes in the West.
And because of her unique ability to take advantage of changing demographics, Hillary can also turn Colorado, Arizona, Nevada and Montana from Red to Blue. Bill Clinton was the only Democrat since 1968 to win these states, and Hillary Clinton is the only Democrat positioned to win them in 2008.
Hillary has an 8 point lead over Rudy Giuliani nationally in the latest ABC/Washington Post poll, and she leads by more than 40 points among Latinos, 18 points among women, 13 points among moderates and more than 80 points among African-Americans in that poll and other recent polls – all crucial voter blocks in the West and nationally.
Two key groups help explain why the West is breaking for Hillary: Latinos and women. They were the swing voter groups whose movement towards Bush gave him victory in 2004 and whose support will be vital to a Democratic victory in 2008. And Hillary has stronger support among these groups than any other Democratic or Republican candidate.
These demographic trends are a big part of the reason Democrats recently picked up a US Senate seat in Montana, the Colorado governor's race, House seats in Colorado, Arizona and California and the Oregon state legislature.
Why are Westerners so excited about Hillary Clinton? Because on the issues that matter to Western voters – like sensible immigration reform, environmental protection, alternative energy, Yucca Mountain, choice, health insurance for children, reducing the budget deficit and ending the Iraq war – Hillary is the only candidate with the experience and record of accomplishment to get the job done.
And Hillary has been reaching out to women and Latinos more than any other campaign – with a bilingual Website and a Website for Women for Hillary, and extensive national and local outreach to both of these core groups, communicating her historic message of change, leadership and experience.
The old adage says as goes the West so goes the country. If that's true, it's just another sign that Hillary Clinton is poised to win.
