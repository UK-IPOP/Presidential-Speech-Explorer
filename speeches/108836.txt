Mitt Romney today announced the support of Florida Commissioner of Agriculture and former Congressman Adam Putnam.
"I am proud to have the support of Commissioner Adam Putnam," said Mitt Romney. "Throughout his career, Adam's leadership on difficult issues has served Floridians well. Adam's support and counsel will be important in the upcoming election, as we work to defeat President Obama and restore the American economy."
"Mitt Romney is a tested conservative and a proven leader. With him in the White House, we can regain our standing abroad and repair our economy at home," said Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam. "Three years into President Obama's term, it is clear that his policies have failed the country. Onerous regulations are burdening businesses, overspending has threatened our credit and unemployment remains dangerously high. Florida has felt the effects of these failed policies more than many other states, and we can't afford to continue down the same path. Mitt Romney knows how the economy works â€“ he spent his life in the private sector and has the knowledge and the plan to put Americans back on the path to prosperity."
