The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 967, which would prohibit the use of U.S. funds to provide for the participation of certain Chinese officials in international programs and exclude specified Chinese officials from admission to the United States.
The Administration opposes the bill because it would:
U.S. interests are best served by increasing the transparency of Chinese society and promoting expansion of China's participation in international fora governed by standards and rules agreed to by the international community of nations. U.S. engagement exposes Chinese officials first-hand to the benefits of an open and democratic system. There is no better way to demonstrate the advantages of a free and open society than to let them experience it for themselves.
