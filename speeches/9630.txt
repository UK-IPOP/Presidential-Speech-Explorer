CHARGES HAVE BEEN laid before the President that some of the private contractors doing work for the Government on flood control projects on the lower Mississippi River are paying unreasonably low wages to Negro employees, overcharging the men at the contractors' commissaries, keeping their camps in a very unsanitary condition and in some cases, resorting to physical violence in the treatment of the men.
The president has requested Dr. Robert R. Moton, head of Tuskegee Institute, Judge James A. Cobb of Washington, D.C., and Mr. Eugene Kinckle Jones, executive secretary of the Urban League of New York City, representing the Negro race, and Lt. Col. U. S. Grant, representing the United States Army, to make a thorough and impartial inquiry as promptly as possible.
He has directed the members of the commission to proceed at their earliest convenience to the places where the construction work is being carried on by these contractors and to report to him on the facts as determined by their investigation immediately upon its conclusion.
