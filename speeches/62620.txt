 Mr. President, what's the message from this part of the visit?
 Did you see the people we saw outside?
 Yes.
 The people we saw outside either don't have coverage or they're afraid of losing it. These children got this care because this hospital is open to all children and gives all children great care, without regard to their income. But not all children have access to hospitals like this. So the message is that all families with children should have some insurance coverage so they can get health care and so they can be well like this. It was great.
 How are the wedding preparations going?
 Fine. We're excited.
