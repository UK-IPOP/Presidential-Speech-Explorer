THE DEATH of Representative Michael J. Kirwan is a loss to the Congress, to the Nation, and to me personally. I join his many other friends in sorrow at his passing, and in respect for his memory and for his long record of service to the Nation. Mrs. Nixon joins me in expressing deep sympathy to Mrs. Kirwan and to the members of their family.
