AT SUGGESTION of Famine Emergency Committee I am asking you as citizen and leader in a field concerned with food relief crisis to serve as member of National Famine Emergency Council. Council members will be asked to take the lead in their organizations or areas in promoting understanding of the facts about the danger of starvation of people in the war zones abroad and about the necessity to conserve food at home to meet those needs. General meeting of the Council is not to be called but you will be asked to serve in your community and organization to further objectives of emergency food program, and to submit your suggestions and recommendations. Please wire me promptly of your acceptance. Letter from Chester C. Davis, Chairman of Committee, will follow.
