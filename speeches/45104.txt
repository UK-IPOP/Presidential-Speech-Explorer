The Administration opposes H.R. 2704, because:


— the reporting requirements are excessively burdensome and insufficiently focused to provide good information; and

— the authorization for long-term mitigation planning agreements with State, local, and private organizations is unnecessary and unduly restrictive.
Accordingly, the Administration recommends that H.R. 2704 be removed from the suspense calendar, so that these objections may be taken into account during House floor consideration of the bill.
