The Administration has no objection to House enactment of H.R. 4350, but will seek amendments in the Senate, including those to:


— include more of the technical amendments proposed by the President to facilitate management of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System; and

— delete the required studies of the Farmington and Great Egg Harbor Rivers, because these rivers run entirely through non-Federal lands and are not appropriate candidates for Federal designation. Technical assistance for State and local conservation efforts can be provided under existing law.
