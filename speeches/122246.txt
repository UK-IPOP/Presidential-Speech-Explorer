I can tell you my position and that is: I stand strongly on behalf of the ability of this government to gather intelligence on our adversaries and our enemies, especially terrorists, but also other nation states. Those [intelligence programs] keep us safer.

There are Republicans, including Senator Cruz, that have voted to weaken those programs. That is just part of the record, it is nothing personal.

The fact of the matter is that, today, we do not know as much as we once did about potential adversaries.
