Hillary Clinton's campaign is making history today by launching a bilingual social networking page expanding on its efforts to reach Hispanic voters across the nation. The new website hosted by the online community MyGrito.com builds on the campaign's efforts to engage these important voters and find new ways to continue her conversation with Americans throughout the country.
Clinton's bilingual social networking effort is focused on maximizing her outreach to communicate directly with supporters by providing regular campaign updates, including information about the campaign activities and photos and video from events.
"Latino voters will play a key role in this election and my campaign is committed to reaching them in innovative ways," Clinton said. "This is an exciting initiative that will help us expand our outreach efforts."
