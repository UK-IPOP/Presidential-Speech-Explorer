I MET today with Secretary Fowler and his Advisory Committee on International Monetary Arrangements. We had a brief discussion of the United States balance of payments situation and the international monetary system.
There was complete agreement on the necessity for the United States to eliminate its balance of payments deficit quickly and to maintain payments equilibrium for a prolonged period.
While we were all pleased with the indications that my balance of payments program, announced February 10, seems to be taking hold, and that the business and financial community is doing a splendid job of voluntary cooperation, we are well aware that it is still much too early to get an accurate picture of just where we stand.
Secretary Fowler is moving ahead effectively to prepare for international agreement on solving any future problem of world liquidity which might arise after we have successfully maintained equilibrium for an extended period. He has put together an excellent committee and I am confident that, under the leadership of Douglas Dillon, they will provide him with the best talent and advice available in this area to supplement the resources in the Government on this vital subject.
