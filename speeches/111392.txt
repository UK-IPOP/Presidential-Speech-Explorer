"President Obama just hasn't made life better for struggling middle-class families. Wages and incomes are down, while Americans are paying more for health care, gasoline, and even college tuition. After three and a half years, it's clear the Obama economy hasn't worked for those who needed the most help. From Day One, Mitt Romney will implement pro-growth policies that get the middle class back on its feet." — Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 OBAMA: "Just like we've tried their plan, we tried our plan — and it worked. That's the difference. That's the choice in this election. That's why I'm running for a second term." (President Barack Obama,

 "The Great Recession shrank Americans' wealth so much that in 2010 median family net worth was no more than it had been in 1992 after adjusting for inflation, the Federal Reserve reported Monday.
