The Administration supports enactment of H.R. 3596, which would enhance the accuracy of credit reports, if it is amended to:



At least one provision of H.R. 3596 would affect receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill is that it would be revenue neutral. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from this estimate. If H.R. 3596 were enacted, a final OMB scoring estimate would be published within five days of enactment, as required by OBRA. The cumulative effects of all enacted legislation on direct spending will be issued in monthly reports transmitted to the Congress.
