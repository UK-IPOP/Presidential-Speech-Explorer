ARLINGTON, VA -- Today, Virginia Delegate Chris Saxman (R-Staunton), co-chairman of the McCain 2008 Virginia campaign, released a statement in response to Governor Tim Kaine's remarks yesterday:
"We are glad Governor Kaine is following John McCain's leadership and has come to agree with John McCain and those military commanders who pushed for the troop surge and change in strategy to reduce violence in Iraq. We are also pleased to see him move away from Barack Obama's Inflate Your Tires Comprehensive Energy Plan,' and instead, move decidedly toward Senator McCain's All of the Above' energy policy. With this shift, it appears Gov. Kaine is now campaigning to be John McCain's vice president." 
 Asked by Wolf Blitzer about the troop surge, Gov. Kaine said, "The notion that more troops would mean more order, I think, is not a particularly controversial one." When asked about offshore drilling, Kaine flatly said, "I'm open to the exploration." ("Situation Room," CNN, 7/6/08).
