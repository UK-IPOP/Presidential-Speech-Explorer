Greetings from a sunny Joint Base Andrews. Below is a background memo from the White House on POTUS travel to Lower Macungie Township, Pennsylvania, today.
 Out-of-Town Travel Pool
 White House Press Office
 July 28, 2021
 Background for the President’s Visit to Pennsylvania
· The President believes that when we spend American taxpayers’ dollars, it should support American workers and businesses. Today, the President will talk about the importance of his Buy American policy to support and grow more American companies; put more American workers in good-paying, union jobs; strengthen American manufacturing; and secure critical supply chains while confronting the climate crisis.
· During his trip, the President will visit the Lehigh Valley Operations Manufacturing Facility for Mack Trucks. There are more than 1,500 Mack trucks in the Federal fleets, used by both military and civilian agencies, and the President will receive a briefing on the Mack Trucks electrical dump truck. Every Mack truck built for the North American market gets its start at the company’s cab and vehicle assembly plant in Lower Macungie Township, Pennsylvania. The ability to build and sell these new trucks would be helped by the President’s proposed investments in Buy American production incentives for domestic EV manufacturing.
· More than 
 in state fiscal relief.
· More than 
 in local fiscal relief.
· More than 
 in relief for K-12 schools.
· Economic impact payments of 
 (above the $600 per person provided in December) for more than 8.1 million adults and 2.8 million children. This is 86% of all adults in the Commonwealth and 84% of all children in the Commonwealth.
· Additional relief of 
 through the Child Tax Credit to the families of 2,368,000 children, lifting 140,000 children out of poverty.
· Additional relief of 
through the Earned Income Tax Credit to 700,000 childless workers, including many in frontline jobs.
· Marketplace health insurance premiums that are 
 for a 60-year old couple earning $75,000 per year.
· Last week, the Department of Commerce announced $3 billion in American Rescue Plan funds to support transformational regional economic development strategies, strengthen workforce training systems, and help distressed communities recover from the pandemic. The funding will support coalitions of local government, labor and community-based organizations, and industry partners to plan and implement economic growth strategies, including through the creation or expansion of new sectors.
· Personal income surged 68% at an annual rate during the first quarter of 2021.
· The unemployment rate in Pennsylvania has fallen by almost half since June 2020 (13.3% to 6.9%).
· GDP increased 6% in the first quarter.
· Case rates have dropped by 91% since January 20, 2021.
· Death rates have dropped by 97% since January 20, 2021.
· Hospitalizations have dropped by 90% since January 20, 2021.
· Number of Pennsylvania residents with at least one dose: 8,324,369 people (65% of the total population, 77.8% of the adult population).
· Number of Pennsylvania residents fully vaccinated: 6,645,348 people (51.9% of the total population, 62.5% of the adult population).
· 
As of July 25, there are 1,700 pharmacies in the Commonwealth administering COVID-19 vaccine. The majority of these pharmacies offer no-appointment, walk-in vaccinations. Over 3.6 million doses have been administered in the Commonwealth through pharmacies.
· 
The Biden-HarrisAdministration is delivering vaccine doses directly to 22 CHCs in the Commonwealth, spanning over 50. As of July 26, 64,850 doses have been delivered directly to CHCs in the Commonwealth.
· 
 As of July 7, the Biden-HarrisAdministration has provided over $217 million in FEMA funding to Pennsylvania to support vaccination operations in communities across the Commonwealth. In addition, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, the Administration has provided more than $157 million to 42 community health centers to help expand medical services, including vaccinations, in underserved communities; and an additional $125 million in Rescue Plan funding to the Commonwealth and local public health departments, as well as community-based organizations in Pennsylvania, to support vaccine education and outreach efforts.
· 
 To date, the Biden-Harris Administration has deployed 400 Federal personnel to community vaccination centers in the Commonwealth, with 11 currently deployed. The Administration has also provided Federal funding for over 430 National Guard members to support Pennsylvania’s overall COVID-19 response, with 70 currently supporting.
· 
 As of July 7, the Biden-HarrisAdministration has provided Federal support for 40 community vaccination centers in the Commonwealth, in the form of Federal funding, personnel, and/or equipment. 12 of these sites are currently operational. There was previously one federally-run community vaccination center, at the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia, which administered over 328,500 shots.
Pennsylvania’s infrastructure received a 
grade on its Infrastructure Report Card. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework (BIF) would:
· 
. In Pennsylvania there are 3,353 bridges and over 7,540 miles of highway in poor condition. Since 2011, commute times have increased by 7.6% in Pennsylvania and on average, each driver pays $620 per year in costs due to driving on roads in need of repair. The BIF will devote more than $312 billion to transform our nation’s transportation infrastructure and make it more resilient, including $110 billion for roads, bridges, and major projects. The BIF is the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the interstate highway system.
· 
. Pennsylvanians who take public transportation spend an extra 69% of their time commuting and non-white households are five times more likely to commute via public transportation. 22% of trains and other transit vehicles in the Commonwealth are past useful life. The BIF will modernize public transit with a $48.5 billion investment and will invest $66 billion in passenger and freight rail. The BIF is the largest Federal investment in public transit in history and is the largest Federal investment in passenger rail since the creation of Amtrak.
· 
. From 2010 to 2020, Pennsylvania has experienced 37 extreme weather events, costing the Commonwealth up to $10 billion in damages. BIF includes $47 billion to improve the resiliency of our infrastructure and support communities’ recovery from disaster. The BIF is the largest investment in the resilience of physical and natural systems in American history.
· 
 Over the next 20 years, Pennsylvania’s drinking water infrastructure will require $16.8 billion in additional funding. The BIF includes a $55 billion investment to ensure clean, safe drinking water is a right in all communities. The BIF would completely eliminate the nation’s lead service lines and pipes and represents the largest investment in clean drinking water and waste water infrastructure in American history.
· 
5% of Pennsylvanians live in areas where, by one definition, there is no broadband infrastructure that provides minimally acceptable speeds. 44% of Pennsylvanians live in areas where there is only one such internet provider. 14% of Pennsylvania households do not have an internet subscription. Just as the Federal Government made a historic effort to provide electricity to every American nearly one hundred years ago, the BIF will make an historic investment to bring universal, reliable, high-speed, and affordable coverage to every family in America.
· 
An average low-income family spends 8-10% of their income on home energy costs forcing tough choices between paying energy bills and buying food, medicine or other essentials. The BIF will represent the single largest investment in clean energy transmission in American history, building thousands of miles of new, resilient transmission lines to facilitate the expansion of renewable energy, including through a new Grid Authority.
· 
 The average cost of a 2-year degree in Pennsylvania was almost $5,700 a year in 2019-2020. The Build Back Better agenda will provide at least two years of free community college to students across more than 20 colleges, including Dreamers. The Build Back Better agenda will also increase the maximum Pell Grant awards by nearly $1,500 to support the nearly 200,000 students in Pennsylvania who rely on Pell for their education. In addition, the plan will provide support to 24 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and minority-serving institutions (MSIs) in Pennsylvania, including tuition subsidies for low- and middle-income students attending these institutions.
· 
 Today, only 104,000 or 36 percent of the 286,000 3-and 4-year-olds- in Pennsylvania are enrolled in publicly funded pre-school. The Build Back Better agenda will provide access to free, high-quality pre-school for all 3- and 4-year-olds in Pennsylvania, and ensure that all employees in funded pre-school programs are paid a $15 minimum wage and that funded programs provide compensation and benefits comparable to kindergarten educators to those with similar qualifications.
· 
 In Pennsylvania there has been a 49 percent decline in new teacher supply. And while we know that having teachers reflect the communities they serve is critical to student performance, in Pennsylvania just 6 percent of teachers are teachers of color, while students of color make up 35 percent of the student population. The Build Back Better agenda will invest in our teachers so we address teacher shortages, improve teacher preparation, recruit and develop more teachers of color and leverage our veteran teachers to help support and train new teachers.
· 
 The average annual cost of child care at a center for a toddler in Pennsylvania is $11,400, meaning that the average two-parent household would have to spend 11 percent of their income on child care for one child every year. The Build Back Better agenda will enable low and middle-income families to pay no more than 7 percent of their income on high-quality child care, generating lifetime benefits for 289,000 children under 5 in Pennsylvania and helping working families make ends meet. And, it will boost compensation of child care workers, improving quality and supply of child care.
· 
 Currently 16 percent of children in Pennsylvania live in food insecure households and 28 percent are obese. The Build Back Better agenda will ensure that the nutritional needs of Pennsylvania’s children are met by expanding access to free school meals to an additional 288,000 students and providing 947,000 students with resources to purchase food over the summer.
· 
 In part due to a lack of available and affordable housing, nearly 720,000 renters in Pennsylvania are rent burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on rent. The Build Back Better agenda will make critical investments to increase housing supply and address the affordable housing crisis.
· 
 The Build Back Better agenda will extend the American Rescue Plan’s Child Tax Credit (CTC), Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, and Earned Income Tax Credit.

Allentown, Pa —
POTUS disembarked AF1 shortly after noon. He was wearing a mask, and then took it off as he stepped through the AF1 door.
He did not answer repeated shouted questions from your poolers about the purported infrastructure deal but said in response to a question about vaccine mandates: "I'm talking about made in America today."
It was really hard to hear, so pls check official transcript. Motorcade is rolling as of 12:08 p.m.
Lower Macungie Township, Pa. —
The POTUS motorcade arrived at Mack-Lehigh Valley Operations Manufacturing facility at 12:35 p.m. About a block or so from the facility, dozens and dozens of Trump supporters, waving pro-Trump signs and flags, greeted the motorcade, followed immediately by an equally large crowd of Biden supporters, waving their own signs and flags.
The White House passes along a list of greeters at Mack Truck:

Lower Macungie Township, Pa. –
The White House sends along this list of photo line participants:
After arriving at the Mack Trucks facility, the President participated in a photo line with:
Attorney General Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania
Mayor Ronald Conrad, Macungie Borough
County Executive Phil Armstrong, Lehigh County
Representative Peter Schweyer (Lehigh County)
Representative Ryan Mackenzie (Lehigh County/Berks County)
Lower Macungie Township, Pa. —
POTUS participated in a roughly 15-minute tour of the Mack Trucks facility -- a giant warehouse-like center filled with truck parts – stopping at three different areas of the facility to speak with employees/local UAW members who spoke with POTUS about how the facility manufactures trucks here, including those of the electric variety.
POTUS, accompanied by two men (all IDs, via the White House, at the bottom of the report), emerged at 1:05 p.m. The first stop, where he viewed two truck cabs (one white and one fire-engine red), was flanked by two blue Made In America signs and a large red Made in America flag. Your pooler could not hear any of the conversation during this first stop.
At 1:10 p.m., POTUS moved to the second stop, where he viewed a cream-colored truck cab that was about to be dropped onto a chassis during that phase of production. Tammy Flower, one of the employees, told POTUS that it was a "great honor" to greet him and noted that "it's been a tough year." The other worker, Eric Meyers, explained to POTUS that he was the third generation in his family working at the plant.
This location is also where POTUS briefly answered a question about the infrastructure deal, telling the pool: "I feel confident about it."
At the last stop, POTUS viewed a blue electric truck, and the tour ended around 1:20 p.m.
Throughout the tour, POTUS did not wear a mask. Note (and a h/t to my WaPo colleague Annie Linskey): Lehigh County, Pa., appears to have a moderate level of community transmission, which means masks are not required indoors.
Here is the list of tour participants, and more background on the facility, via the WH:
