 — Nearly every candidate in the GOP race for President claims to fight for stopping illegal immigration. However, only U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has a proven record of repeatedly and consistently fighting to do so.
Ted Cruz believes we must secure the border and enforce our immigration laws. As President, Ted Cruz would rescind President Obama's unconstitutional executive amnesty and cut off all federal funds to sanctuary cities that refuse to enforce immigration laws and cooperate in the capture of illegal immigrants who commit violent crimes.
