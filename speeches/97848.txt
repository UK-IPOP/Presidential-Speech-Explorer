The United States joins with the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in condemning in the strongest terms the October 16th massacre of more than 30 innocent civilians by Taliban extremists in Kandahar province. We extend our heartfelt condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in this attack.
This barbaric attack is the latest disturbing chapter in the ongoing saga of the Taliban's outright war on the people of Afghanistan. It should serve as a reminder to Afghans, as well as to us, of the nature of the enemy that we face there. The United States -- along with our NATO partners -- train their soldiers, protect their civilians and help build their roads so that there might be a brighter day ahead for this struggling young democracy. The Taliban and al Qaeda on the other hand, have stopped buses on those roads and brutally executed dozens of innocent civilians in order to stop that brighter day from ever coming. The differences between the two competing visions for the future of Afghanistan could not be more stark.
We will continue to stand with the democratically-elected government of Afghanistan as they find the perpetrators of this heinous attack and bring them to justice, and recommit ourselves to fighting extremists there so that the Afghan people will have a future free of such atrocities.
