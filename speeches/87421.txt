 The strategy Multi-National Force in Iraq Commander General David Petraeus is pursuing makes securing Baghdad our top priority, gives our troops the reinforcements they need, and demands more from Iraq's elected government. Tactics of the strategy include:
 General Petraeus arrived in Baghdad in early February, and it is far too early to judge the success of his operation. However, Iraqi and U.S. forces are making gradual but important progress:
1) Narrowing the limitations of the de-Baathification law;

      3) Pursuing the constitutional review process.
 The United States supports the Iraqi government as it pursues an international initiative to build diplomatic, economic, and security support for its young democracy. Last week, the Iraqis announced that they will hold a conference in Baghdad that will include officials from Iraq's neighboring countries, as well as the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, the Arab League, and the Organization of the Islamic Conference. It will be followed in April by a second conference that includes Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and her counterparts from around the world.
