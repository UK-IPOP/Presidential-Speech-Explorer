Since Taking Office, President Obama Has Repeatedly Apologized For America's Leadership Throughout The World
 OBAMA: "Just as we stood for freedom in the 20th century, we must stand together for the right of people everywhere to live free from fear in the 21st century. And as nuclear power —- as a nuclear power, as the only nuclear power to have used a nuclear weapon, the United States has a moral responsibility to act. We cannot succeed in this endeavor alone, but we can lead it, we can start it." (President Barack Obama,  
, Prague, Czech Republic, 4/5/09)
 OBAMA: "Nine-eleven was an enormous trauma to our country. The fear and anger that it provoked was understandable, but in some cases, it led us to act contrary to our traditions and our ideals. We are taking concrete actions to change course." (President Barack Obama, 
, Cairo, Egypt, 6/4/09)
 OBAMA: "My job to the Muslim world is to communicate that the Americans are not your enemy. We sometimes make mistakes. We have not been perfect. But if you look at the track record, as you say, America was not born as a colonial power, and that the same respect and partnership that America had with the Muslim world as recently as 20 or 30 years ago, there's no reason why we can't restore that." ("Obama Tells Al Arabiya Peace Talks Should Resume," 
, 1/27/09)
 OBAMA: "While the United States has done much to promote peace and prosperity in the hemisphere, we have at times been disengaged, and at times we sought to dictate our terms." (President Barack Obama, 
, Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, 4/17/09) 
 BIDEN: "When we took office, let me remind you, there was virtually no international pressure on Iran. We were the problem; we were diplomatically isolated in the world, in the region, in Europe." (Vice President Joe Biden, 
, Atlanta, GA, 5/8/12)
