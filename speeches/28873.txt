THE SUPREME COURT has spoken decisively on the timing of school desegregation. There are, of course, practical and human problems involved. With all of us working together in full respect for the law, I am confident we can overcome these problems.
I intend to use the leadership resources of the executive branch of Government to assist in every possible way in doing so. I call upon all citizens, and particularly those in leadership positions, to work together in seeking solutions for these problems in accordance with the mandate of the Court.
