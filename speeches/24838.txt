THE United States Government has for many years believed that the establishment of normal relations between the Republic of Korea and Japan would be a historic step that would bring important and durable benefits to both nations and to the free world.
I was pleased to learn that the Korean Government has just ratified the Basic Relations Treaty with Japan and its associated agreements. The establishment of normal relations between these two countries will be welcomed by all friends of the Republic of Korea and Japan.
