Dear Mr. :
The technological revolution, which is providing us with the highest standard of living in the world, has been accompanied by many problems. There have been dislocations, loss of jobs, and the spectre of poverty in the midst of plenty.
At the same time we encourage progress we must be alert to the effects of the forces generating that progress. We must make sure that as technological progress creates new industries and job opportunities it does not impose too great a hardship on individual workers. I therefore recommend the creation of a National Commission on Automation and Technological Progress, to study current and future trends in technological change, and to recommend the most constructive action that can be taken to secure maximum benefits with the least possible harmful effects upon the Nation.
I am enclosing a draft of legislation that will accomplish this purpose, together with the letter from the Secretary of Labor submitting the draft bill to me.
Congress, I know, has been giving considerable attention to these problems. I urge prompt enactment of this proposal.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
