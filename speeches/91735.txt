COUNCIL BLUFFS, IA -- Governor Bill Richardson announced his plan for universal, affordable healthcare in a speech to Iowans today.
"We need universal healthcare now," said Governor Richardson. "Now is the time. For every American who wants to look a suffering loved one in the eye and tell them that tomorrow will be better than today -- now is the time. For the good of our nation, now must be the time."
Governor Richardson outlined the following details of his plan:
"My plan provides choices -- including the choice to keep your current coverage -- and existing programs to expand coverage options," said Governor Richardson. "We spend over 2.2 trillion dollars a year on health care in this country. We all know that we're not getting what we've paid for.
"We need to require that all health plans cover a standard set of proven preventive services. If there's one thing better than a patient's being cured of a disease, it's his never having had it at all."
Governor Richardson also criticized the Bush Administration for its failed and misguided efforts on healthcare.
"Today, we as a nation need to be responsible stewards of the health of our children and parents, our brothers and sisters, our husbands and wives," said Richardson. "President Bush has failed this basic test of American decency."
