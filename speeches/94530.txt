The same day it announced she will visit the Ocean State on February 24, the Clinton Campaign today launched two 30-second ads in Rhode Island touting Hillary's ability to tackle the economic challenges facing America and record of real results.
The first spot, entitled "Warned," makes clear that when Hillary is President, she will enact an economic plan to freeze foreclosures, provide immediate tax rebates for the middle class and create new jobs to stimulate the local economy.
In "Lifetime," Hillary Clinton speaks to her 35-year record of delivering real change on issues of importance to America's working families as a public servant, activist, and Senator. The ad highlights Hillary's approach of results over rhetoric, and her promise to work hard every day towards solutions to our nation's most pressing problems.
