ON THIS anniversary of the independence of Indonesia, it is a particular pleasure to send to your people and to you warmest congratulations from the people and government of the United States. This August 17th comes at the conclusion of an historic negotiation for the peaceful future of West Iran. The United States joins in the hope that this agreement will lead forward to increasing satisfactory relations among all who have been concerned with it. Meanwhile we join with you in a salute to your 17th anniversary.
JOHN F. KENNEDY
