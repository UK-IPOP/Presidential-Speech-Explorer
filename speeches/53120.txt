The Administration opposes House passage of H.R. 901, although it generally shares the aims of this legislation and supports enactment of several of its provisions. For example, the bill would make permanent the respite care program and extend the expiring authorizations for State Home grants and care for homeless chronically mentally ill veterans. The bill would also make desirable improvements in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Compensated Work Therapy programs, and includes certain useful statutory changes concerning VA medical care personnel recruitment and retention.

However, these provisions are outweighed by various objectionable provisions in H.R. 901. Most notably, we object to the provision which would expand outpatient care eligibility to authorize comprehensive outpatient care for all so-called "Category A" veterans; i.e., primarily veterans with lower incomes or service-connected disabilities. This provision represents a significant enlargement of the group of veterans for whom VA must provide comprehensive outpatient treatment under current law, and could entail additional costs to VA in excess of $1 billion annually. Any changes or expansion of eligibility should be held in abeyance and considered in a broader context.

Other objectionable provisions of the bill include:

authorizing provision of VA health care to Department of Defense (DOD) dependents at VA facilities under VA/DOD sharing agreements. The Administration does not favor such a concept at this time, since it raises numerous unresolved issues that could have a significant impact on the VA medical care system.
