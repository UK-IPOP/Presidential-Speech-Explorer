I transmit herewith a communication from the Secretary of State transmitting a report on the International Opium Commission and on the opium problem as seen within the United States and its possessions, prepared by Mr. Hamilton Wright on behalf of the American delegates to the said commission, held at Shanghai in February, 1909. In reference to this report the Secretary of State makes certain recommendations regarding an appropriation and other legislative action, which I commend to the Congress with my approval and the request that action should be taken accordingly.
