Dear Mr. :
I am forwarding herewith a draft bill to amend the Alaska Omnibus Act, Public Law 86-70, together with an explanatory memorandum from the Director of the Bureau of the Budget.
The primary purpose of the bill is to amend section 44(a) of the Omnibus Act to authorize $22,500,000 for additional transitional grants to the State of Alaska until June 30, 1966. I believe that this form of assistance to the State is essential to help it overcome the results of the tragic earthquake of March 27.
The funds thus provided, a portion of which would be passed on to local governments affected by the disaster, are needed to insure the continuance of State and local government during the emergency when revenues will be lost and extraordinary expenses will be incurred. I recommend and urge prompt enactment of this most necessary proposal.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
