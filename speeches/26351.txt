Mr. President and Members of the Senate: I appreciate very much your asking me to come here today. I always enjoyed my association with the Senate. I served here as a Senator, a whip, a Minority Leader, a Majority Leader, and later as Vice President.

I always profit from what I learn from the Members of this great body, and I appreciate all that you have done to ease my burden to help us better govern this. Nation.
I hope that through the years to come, I shall have the privilege of seeing all of you from time to time and that together we can continue to build and develop this Nation and continue to make it the best country in all the world.
