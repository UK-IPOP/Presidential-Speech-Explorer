doing impossible things. Um – New York City, it was impossible to reduce crime. New York City, it was impossible to reduce welfare. New York City was ungovernable and unmanageable and impossible to run. And I love to be challenged by the impossible. Because what the excitement of being in government is and what the excitement of being able to contribute to people is, is to take those impossible things and turn them into possible. And I'd really like the opportunity to do that and I'd like to have your support." (Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Remarks To New Hampshire Business And Industry Association, Nashua, NH, 4/24/07)

 Giuliani: "And sure, they started this war and they can end it. This war ends when they stop planning to come here and kill us. But until then, if I have anything to say about it, the lesson that I learned coming out of September 11, 2001 is never, ever again will this country be on defense waiting for them to attack us. The United States of America will be on offense." (Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Remarks, Rockingham County, NH, 4/24/07)
