To build the most innovation-friendly economy in the world, we must build the most business-friendly economy in the world. Right now we have the exact opposite. The United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. We have a tax code that punishes American companies for competing in the global economy, and a regulatory system that prevents small businesses — the primary engines of innovation and job creation — from competing against established players.
