Dear Mr.__________:
In the State of the Union address I asked the Congress for increased discretion to use economic tools as an aid in re-establishing our historic ties of friendship with the people of Eastern Europe.
I urge the Congress to take early action on legislation to accomplish this purpose. Such legislation--along the lines of the amendment to the Mutual Defense Assistance Control Act of 1951 which was passed by the Senate on September 12, 1959--accompanies this letter.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
