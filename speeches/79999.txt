Since Presidents Bush and Putin launched it in November 2001, the Russian-American Media Entrepreneurship Dialogue has met several times, both in Russia and in the United States. The purpose of this Dialogue is to improve business conditions that can support free and independent private journalism. American participants traveled to Russia in March 2002 to meet with their Russian counterparts to discuss the state of the Russian media and possible areas of cooperation. In April, the American coordinators, the National Association of Broadcasters, and the Newspaper Association of America hosted Russian Dialogue participants at their annual conventions and held further discussions. The Dialogue is convening a meeting in Moscow coincident with the meeting of the two Presidents, and representatives will have an opportunity to brief the two Presidents on progress to date.
