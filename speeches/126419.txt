Marco is having a strong night tonight.

Rubio wins, Cruz did well, Kasich was Kasich, and Trump's vacuousness would be the story in any other year. This is not any other year.

 is having a great second half.

Standing for principle is more popular than bipartisanship among Republican voters.

Rubio got off virtually every memorable line of the night, including "I don't care about being politically correct, I just want to be correct on this issue." He also embarrassingly exposed Trump's lack of basic knowledge about foreign policy, especially with respect to Cuba. Rubio was smart, snappy, and contained Trump without really insulting him.
Marco Rubio really had the best debate of anyone on that debate stage. His answers on Cuba, Islam, Global Warming, etc. were just so solid...Rubio's answer on Cuba might have won him Florida. His performance was outstanding.
The Florida Senator was poised, confident and knowledgeable...Rubio deserves credit for performing extremely well when the chips were down.
He needed to hit a home run in his home state, and he did so by dumping the personal attacks and adopting a more personal approach. He mixed in anecdotes, including a touching one about a supporter who keeps heading out to campaign for him even though he's recovering from surgery, and combined that with a fierce condemnation of Barack Obama's Cuba policy and an incisive grip on policy details. Winner.
