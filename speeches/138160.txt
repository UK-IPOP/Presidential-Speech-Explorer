Kamala Harris has spent decades lying for political gain and turning her back on the very people that believe her empty promises. Kamala Harris will do or say anything to get ahead, including gleefully accepting the position of Joe Biden's running mate even after condemning him for his previous racist rhetoric and destructive policies. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are two sides of the same coin whose radical agenda and empty promises are dead wrong for America. Our nation needs four more years of Promises Made, Promises Kept from President Donald J. Trump. This President continues to lead our country to historic heights and defends the principles that make America great - accomplishments the radical left cannot deliver for the American people.

 by Trump 2020 Senior Advisor Lara Trump.
"Phony Kamala's lies know no limits as she aims to fool voters into supporting her radical agenda to defund the police and hike taxes by $4 trillion, said 
 "The American people are not interested in Joe Biden and Kamala Harris' extreme policies, and our nation's patriots will make that message loud and clear at the ballot box this November."
