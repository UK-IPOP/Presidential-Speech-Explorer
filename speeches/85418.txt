We are launching the next generation of our common security strategy to further secure North America and ensure the streamlined movement of legitimate travelers and cargo across our shared borders. To this end, Canada, the United States, and Mexico will work together to ensure the highest continent-wide security standards and streamlined risk-based border processes are achieved in the following priority areas:
1) Secure North America from external threats
2) Prevent and respond to threats within North America
3) Further streamline the secure movement of low-risk traffic across our shared borders
