ARLINGTON, VA -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today launched the McCain Truth Squad to counter recent attacks on John McCain's military service and credentials in national security affairs. The campaign also unveiled a new web site, 
 , to set the record straight against Internet smears of John McCain's service.
"We're proud of John McCain's record of service and sacrifice for our nation," said Lt.Col. Orson Swindle, USMC (Ret.), who served as a POW with McCain. "John's war record -- the character, courage and commitment he displayed in the hardest of circumstances, is well-documented, and we absolutely refuse to allow his political opponents to rewrite history for political gain. We know the truth because we lived it with him, and we stand ready to make sure all Americans know the truth."
In the event of false attacks on John McCain's military service record, the McCain Truth Squad will issue statements to voters and to members of the media that set the record straight. In addition, members of the Truth Squad will be available to respond quickly to inquiries from the media regarding negative attacks.
