Upon the closing of the Ten-Nation Committee on Disarmament, I want you to know how deeply grateful I am to you for undertaking the Chairmanship and for your efforts to find an agreement which would halt the building up of armaments.
Your strong, courageous and imaginative leadership has been a source of pride to all of us who have been working with you. It was not due to any fault on the part of yourself and your associates that no agreement , was reached. In any event you have made the United States position of dedication to peace clear to the world. You have my congratulations and best wishes. With warm regard,
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
