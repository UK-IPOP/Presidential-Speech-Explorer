"Palin, 44, has been the Joan of Arc of Alaska politics, charging into battle against long odds on such big local issues as oil taxes and construction of a natural gas pipeline only to see her opposition crumble." (Tom Kizzia, "Gov. Sarah Palin: A Biography," 
, 8/29/08)
 "It is true, as the statement said, that Palin has a record of bipartisan reform. She has a growing reputation as a maverick for bucking her party's establishment and Alaska's powerful oil industry." (Ron Fournier, "Analysis: Palin's Age, Inexperience Rival Obama's," 
, 8/29/08) 
 "Sen. John McCain's surprising choice for vice president, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, appears to be every bit the maverick he is. A dyed-in-the-wool conservative, Palin nonetheless made her considerable Alaska reputation by taking on establishment politicians -- even bringing ethics charges against fellow Republicans." (Editorial, "A Surprise Choice, Well-Timed," 
, 8/30/08) 
"Palin, 44, a maverick governor and a staunch, anti-abortion, pro-gun rights conservative, is a political outsider who has five children and a working-class background." (Jessica Fargen, "Sarah Palin: Mom, Hunter, Maverick," 
, 8/30/08)
 "She can get in there and compete with anybody. I mean, she was in a tough campaign, she has been a hard-nosed fighter, not only for Republican values, but also in her state and she has been successful." (MSNBC, 8/29/08) 
 "But Ms. Palin ran as a change agent when she was elected as governor of Alaska in 2006, and in a move that might have appealed to Mr. McCain, she took intense criticism from members of her own party for turning the spotlight on the failures of Alaska Republicans, some of whom had been beset by corruption scandals." (Michael Cooper And Mitchell L. Blumenthal, "McCain Chooses Palin As Running Mate," 
, 8/29/08) 
 (Editorial, "The Maverick Is Back," 
, 8/30/08) 
"On the other hand, the record shows that Sarah Palin's political career is a case study in taking on the big boys. We suspect her record of fighting the status quo was uppermost in John McCain's decision." (Editorial, "A Reform Ticket," 
, 8/30/08) 
"Palin, a 44-year-old mother of five who hunts caribou and was once a beauty queen, rose to the statehouse by challenging the corruption that has become endemic in Alaska, even if it meant taking on the Republican establishment there, including the former governor and the state's congressional delegation." (Amy Goldstein and Michael D. Shear, "A Tenacious Reformer's Swift Rise," 
, 8/30/08) 
 "Sarah Palin changed all that. She was not only a surprise choice but also an electrifying one, and her selection has far-reaching implications. Her entry will change the nature of the presidential race. And if the McCain-Palin ticket wins, it has the potential to carry Republicans through a rough patch and even ensure conservative dominance of the party--for years to come." (Fred Barnes, "Providential Palin," 
, 8/30/08) 
 "Obama has no experience, obviously. He was a state Senator. Sarah Palin has much more executive experience. She has been governor of the state while Obama has been pretty much an absentee senator running for Senate." (FOX News' "Special Report," 8/29/08) 
 (Editorial, "With McCain's Pick, A Whole New Race," 
, 8/30/08) 
 (FOX News' "Special Report," 8/29/08)
 "By picking Alaska governor Sarah Palin as his running mate, John McCain has wowed the public and enthused the Right. He has reinforced some of his winning themes -- that he has the mindset of an outsider and a fighter against corruption. He has also reinforced his appeal as the candidate more in touch with traditional values on moral issues." (Editorial, "The Palin Pick," 
, 8/29/08) 
"It will go down in history as one of the boldest, most deft and wonderfully strategic vice-presidential picks ever. Palin has the same maverick reputation as Sen. McCain and has been a pull-no-punches reformer in The Last Frontier. She even took on the ethically challenged hierarchy of her own state GOP." (Editorial, "McCain-Palin: A Bold & Deft Pick," 
, 8/30/08) 
 "She unseated a sitting Republican governor in a primary by running against the Republican establishment in Alaska. If anything, her zeal for busting pork-barrel spending may outstrip Mr. McCain's. And she's spent her time in office fighting for ethics reform." (Stephen Dinan, "Trumping Obama On Change," 
, 8/30/08) 
 (Fred Barnes, "Palin Fought For Reform In Alaska," 
, 8/30/08)
 (Laura Meckler, Elizabeth Holmes and Jim Carlton, "McCain's Surprise V.P. Choice," 
, 8/30/08) 
"For starters, we'd say Governor Palin's credentials as an agent of reform exceed Barack Obama's. Mr. Obama rose through the Chicago Democratic machine without a peep of push-back. Alaska's politics are deeply inbred and backed by energy-industry money. Mr. Obama slid past the kind of forces that Mrs. Palin took head on." (Editorial, "A Reform Ticket," 
, 8/30/08) 
 "In choosing Palin, McCain also doubles down on the maverick argument; Palin is the face of reform in the Republican party nationally and is clearly not of Washington -- a key element of her biography given how negative voter sentiment toward the nation's capital is currently." (Chris Cillizza, "The Palin Stunner," 
, 8/29/08) 
 "Palin has earned a reputation as a reformer, taking on Republican leaders on ethics issues. She opposed pork-barrel projects backed by her party and helped kill the project known as the 'Bridge to Nowhere,' which had been promoted by Alaskan Republican leaders, notably Rep. Don Young and Sen. Ted Stevens." (Robert Barnes, Michael Shear And William Branigin, "McCain Introduces Alaska Governor Palin As Running Mate," 
, 8/29/08) 
 (ABC's "Good Morning America," 8/20/08) 
"In turning to her, McCain picked an independent figure in his own mold, one who has taken on Alaska's powerful oil industry and, at age 44, is three years younger than Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama and a generation younger than McCain, 72." (Steve Quinn And Calvin Woodward, "McCain's Veep Choice Is Historic And Hardly Known," 
, 8/29/08) 
"In a state known of late for the corruption of its Republican politicians, Palin has challenged corruption at all levels. She knocked off an incumbent GOP governor in the primary; enacted ethics reforms and told Congress 'thanks but no thanks' on that infamous 'bridge to nowhere.' And as one of her first acts in office, she sold off the jet the former governor used to get around the state." (Editorial, "With McCain's Pick, A Whole New Race," 
, 8/30/08) 
 "In choosing Ms. Palin -- a 44-year-old social conservative and mother of five who has been governor for less than two years -- the McCain campaign reached far outside the Washington Beltway in an election in which the Democratic presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, is running on a platform of change." (Michael Cooper And Mitchell L. Blumenthal, "McCain Chooses Palin As Running Mate," 
, 8/29/08)
 (Jonathan Martin and Tim Grieve, "The Ticket: McCain-Palin," 
, 8/29/08)
 "Palin, former mayor of the town of Wasilla, built a reputation as a reformer in a state that recently has been hit with corruption scandals. Elected in 2006, she is Alaska's first woman governor." (Jeff Mason, "McCain Picks Palin As Surprise No. 2," 
, 8/29/08) 
 "
 (FOX News' "Special Report," 8/29/08) 
"Mr. McCain's instinct clearly is to offer himself to voters as a reformer. With Sarah Palin, a genuine reformer, Mr. McCain may have found the right idea and the right person to make his run." (Editorial, "A Reform Ticket," 
, 8/30/08) 
 (Editorial, "A Reform Ticket," 
, 8/30/08) 
"Since entering politics she has shown independence and a clear moral compass. On Alaska's oil and gas commission, she blew the whistle on a fellow Republican's conflict of interest. Her 2006 campaign for the state's highest office began as an insurrection against her party's old guard. In choosing her, Mr. McCain said that Ms. Palin's experience equips her to help 'shake up Washington.'" (Editorial, "Mr. McCain's Choice," 
, 8/30/08) 
"Palin is a different kind of Republican. She's a conservative reformer who, somewhat like McCain but more like Ronald Reagan, is forever poised to challenge the sluggish (or corrupt) Republican establishment and shake up the status quo." (Fred Barnes, "Providential Palin," 
, 8/30/08)
 "At a time when many Republicans are still clinging to pork-barrel politics, Governor Palin has quickly become a leader on this issue. ... She is a principled reformer who understands how badly wasteful spending has marred the Republican brand." (Club For Growth PAC, "Club PAC On Possible Palin Pick," Press Release, 8/29/08) 
 (Fred Barnes, "Palin Fought For Reform In Alaska," 
, 8/30/08) 
"Palin took on the oil producers there, saying they had been dragging their feet on a gasline, and she pushed the Legislature to pass a bill authorizing an independent company to build the line." (Tom Kizzia, "Gov. Sarah Palin: A Biography," 
, 8/29/08)
"Even if they didn't know much about her going in, the capacity crowd at Wright State University's Ervin J. Nutter Center roared its approval of John McCain's surprise selection of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate." (Joanne Huist Smith and James Cummings, "Nutter Crowd Greets Palin With Enthusiasm," 
, 8/30/08)
 "I have to tell you, I got a phone call from my family too, and my daughter -- the immediate thing was, 'Wow! McCain picked a woman.' I thought it was stunning when it happened, because it is so historic. The other thing I must say this is the first time that anybody who is in a national position, has publicly thanked me in 24 years." (FOX's "Fox & Friends," 8/30/08) 
 "Well, first, the John McCain campaign definitely served notice that they intend to compete hard for the support of women voters. Of course, I appreciate the reference to Hillary Clinton, who did such a magnificent job in her campaign." (CNN, 8/29/08) 
 "To that end, consider the immediate reaction of Clinton adviser Howard Wolfson, who writes today in a short piece titled 'I'll See Your Biden and Raise You a Palin,' that 'you are going to have a lot of women voters wondering why Senator Obama didn't tap Senator Clinton as his running mate.'" (Jake Tapper, "A White Shade Of Palin," ABC News, 8/29/08) 
 "This is a day that will go down as a turning point, most likely, within evangelical circles ... They are now fervently on-board for John McCain. I think we've seen a dramatic shift today." (CNN's "Newsroom," 8/29/08)
 At a stop in Monaca, Pa., Barack Obama seemed to distance himself from his campaign's first, harshly critical response to the Palin pick." (Ben Smith, "Obama Distances Himself From 'Hair-Trigger' Campaign Criticism," 
, 8/29/08)
 "One of the things that the McCain campaign is suggesting is that in their reaction -- so negative and dismissive of Sarah Palin that the Obama campaign may have made a tactical error, in part downplaying and appearing to sound dismissive of middle American, small town voters." (Fox News, 8/29/08)
