ALTHOUGH I very much regret that time won't permit a personal visit to the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, I believe that Commissioner Norwood's impressive analysis has given me a vivid sense of the progressive spirit now at work in Micronesia. Under his inspired leadership, I am confident that the people of the Trust Territory can look forward to new victories in the never-ending battle against poverty, ignorance, and disease.
Mr. Norwood has the support of every American in this noble cause.
