My dear Mrs. Thompson:
I was greatly shocked this morning to learn of the death of your husband who has been my friend over twenty-five years. Mrs. Hoover and I wish to convey to you our deepest sympathy and our trust that you may be given strength in this, the greatest trial which can come to you.
HERBERT HOOVER
