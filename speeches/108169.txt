Mitt Romney today announced his Montana State Finance leadership team.
"I am proud to announce my Montana State Finance leadership team," said Mitt Romney. "With their help, we will be able to defeat President Obama next November and get our country and economy on the right track again. Montana can be a leader in our economic recovery if we are able to utilize the state's energy resources and encourage small business growth."
Mitt Romney's State Finance Chair Mark Baker said, "It is an honor to join Governor Romney's team in Montana. We look forward to working with him and his campaign to raise the resources needed to defeat President Obama. We are also looking forward to working with him to help Montana play a vital role in our country's economic recovery. The oil, gas, coal, timber and mining resources we develop in Montana are critical to our economy. Montana also has a growing high tech industry that will be important to future growth. Governor Romney's plans to use our energy resources at home and provide an economy for small businesses to thrive will be important for Montana and the country's economic growth."
