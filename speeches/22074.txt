Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Secretary, Mr. Ambassador, Governor Harrison, ladies and gentlemen:
In this house none are so welcome as those leaders who have chosen the path of freedom and democracy. Our guest today is such a leader. He guided his native Malaysia to independence. He led his people to a decisive victory over Communist guerrillas.
He took the lead in the formation last year of the nation of Malaysia. In all of this, he has kept faith with democracy.
He has sought for his people food instead of bullets, clothes instead of uniforms, homes instead of barracks.
Malaysia's success shines as an example for many lands.
Mr. Prime Minister, you and your people have our respect and our faith. We are very glad that you are here today. There are many choices for the world today. There is the choice of perpetual war or permanent peace. There is the choice of order or chaos. There is the choice of the rule of law or the rule of the jungle.
The American people have made their choice--for peace, for order, and for the rule of law.
We are proud to support those whose choices are the same. We support our friends with all the resources of our Nation. We of this generation are determined that men shall live in a world where aggression will not go unpunished, where terror will not go unchallenged, where irresponsibility will not be left to run rampant.
Our course--the course of the United States--has been chosen freely. It will not be lightly changed.
The people of Malaysia have likewise made their choice freely and it likewise will not be changed.
Your Excellency, we of the United States extend to you our congratulations. We wish for your people a future of peace and progress.
Now I should like to ask all of you to join me in a toast to His Majesty, the King of Malaysia, and to the friendship between the Malaysian and American people--long may it endure. To His Majesty.
