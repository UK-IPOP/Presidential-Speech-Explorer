IT GIVES ME a great deal of pleasure to make this presentation this morning to Colonel Schilling.
I have the honor to hand you the certificate and the medal. The trophy is a little too big to carry, but we will go around and uncover it.
I congratulate you. I congratulate the Air Force, and I congratulate you on the success you have had in getting a jet across the Atlantic for the first time without a stop-- something very fine for the welfare of the country and the world, I think.
I hope you will continue to work on these things.
