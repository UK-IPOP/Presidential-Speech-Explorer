Mr. President, Mrs. Ceausescu, our very distinguished guests from Romania, and ladies and gentlemen:
Mr. President, just a year ago you welcomed me to Bucharest as the first American President ever to visit Romania. And today I am very honored to welcome you to Washington, D.C., as the first President of Romania ever to visit the United States of America.
We shall always remember the very warm reception we received from the Romanian people, and we know that in your travels in the United States you have also sensed the warm feeling of friendship and affection that the people of the United States have for the people of Romania.
Despite our different systems of government, we have friendship and affection for the Romanian people, we have respect for the independence of your government, and we wish to work with you in the cause of peace for the world and progress for our peoples and all peoples.
I believe that our talks a year ago contributed to that great purpose of peace and progress for all peoples in the world and better understanding between our two nations. And I know that the talks we will have on this occasion will make a further contribution to that great goal.
We give you a very warm welcome from all the American people to you, to the members of your party, and to the Romanian people.
