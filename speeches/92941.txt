Mike Huckabee appeared tonight on CNN's 
 and once again tried to laugh away his record as governor of Arkansas. Huckabee should stop cracking jokes about raising taxes and start taking responsibility for his actions.
Excerpted quotes from Mike Huckabee on 
 with Wolf Blitzer, November 29, 2007
 : Huckabee claimed that if you dismantle the IRS and implement the Fair Tax, make "the federal government operate more efficiently...[and] get rid of a $10 billion industry." In reality, Huckabee's plan replaces one government bureaucracy with another.
 : Huckabee claimed "it's not the purpose of the federal government to see how many people we can employ." But an examination of his Administration concluded that "state government grew more during his time as governor than during Bill Clinton's." 
 : Huckabee tried to laugh off the video of him begging the Arkansas Legislature for a tax increase by saying "I was in a state of sugar stupor." He then claims that the clip was "taken out of context" and that he "was giving a put up or shut up speech to the legislature who had been saying we have a $200 million dollar deficit and we don't like any proposal the governor has to fix it. So I said ok, you don't like my proposals, here's one of yours, I'll take it." In reality, Huckabee consistently increased taxes throughout his time as Governor and turned first to raising taxes, not cutting government spending, to offset his spending habit.
