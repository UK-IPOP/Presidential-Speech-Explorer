 by proclamation of November 13, 1933 (48 Stat. 1716), there were set apart and reserved as the Chequamegon National Forest in the State of Wisconsin certain lands which had been, or might thereafter be, acquired by the United States of America under authority of the act of Congress approved March 1, 1911, ch. 186, 36 Stat. 961 (U.S.C., title 16, sec. 516), as amended by the act of June 7, 1924, ch. 348, 43 Stat. 653 (U.S.C., title 16, sec. 515), together with certain adjoining public lands; and
 it appears that it would be in the public interest to modify the boundaries of the said national forest by including therein certain forest lands which have been, or may be, acquired under authority of the said acts of March 1, 1911, and June 7, 1924, and certain adjoining public lands, and by transferring to the said national forest the Mondeaux Division of the Nicolet National Forest:
, President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the power in me vested by section 24 of the act of March 3, 1891, ch. 561, 26 Stat. 1095, 1103, as amended (U.S.C., title 16, sec. 471), the act of June 4, 1897, ch. 2, 30 Stat. 34, 36 (U.S.C., title 16, sec. 473), and section 11 of the said act of March 1, 1911, do proclaim (1) that all lands of the United States within the areas shown as additions on the diagrams attached hereto and made a part hereof are hereby included in and reserved as a part of the Chequamegon National Forest, (2) that all lands within such areas which mayÂ  hereafter be acquired by the United States under the said acts of March 1, 1911, and June 7, 1924, shall upon acquisition of title thereto be reserved and administered as a part of the said Forest, and (3) that there is hereby transferred to the said Forest the Mondeaux Division of the Nicolet National Forest.
This proclamation and that modifying the boundaries of the Nicolet National Forest, which I have signed this same day, are made, and are intended to be and shall be considered, as one act and they shall become effective simultaneously.
The reservation made by this proclamation shall as to all lands which are at this date legally appropriated under the public-land laws or reserved for any public purpose other than classification, to subject to and shall not interfere with or defeat legal rights under such appropriation, or prevent the use for such public purpose of lands so reserved, so long as such appropriation is legally maintained or such reservation remains in force.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 31st day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-first.
