ON BEHALF of the U.S. Government and people I extend deepest condolences to you and the Nicaraguan people over the death of President Schick who so ably contributed to the progress of his country.
As you assume the heavy new responsibilities placed on you today, I wish you every success. I look forward to a continuation of the close cooperation between our two countries established with the late President.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[His Excellency Dr. Lorenzo Guerrero, President of the Republic of Nicaragua, Managua, Nicaragua]
