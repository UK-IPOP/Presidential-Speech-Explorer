[Released December 31, 1965. Dated December 30, 1965] I KNOW you are doing what you feel you must do from your personal standpoint, but I am compelled to say that you will be missed in the councils of Washington where your high purpose and great personal integrity have counted so much in the years you were here. I have been privileged to know you well and to serve with you in the Senate. Your friendship is one of the treasures I shall always value most devotedly.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[The Honorable Leverett Saltonstall, Smith Street, Dover, Massachusetts]
