Dear Carter:
I am delighted to hear of your willingness to assume a responsibility which I know will be personally rewarding and of great benefit to the young people of America.
To alert our country on what can and should be done to reach the much desired goal of a happier, healthier, and more totally fit youth in America, I have just appointed a President's Citizens Advisory Committee to work with the President's Council on Youth Fitness. The members of the Committee are named in the list attached.
I am happy to designate you as Chairman through July 1, 1958, knowing that your foresight and leadership will bring tangible results in this essential work on youth fitness.
With warm regard,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
