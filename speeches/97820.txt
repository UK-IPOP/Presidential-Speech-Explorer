ARLINGTON, VA -- Today, McCain-Palin 2008 campaign spokesman Ben Porritt released the following statement:
"As the head of a left-wing activist organization, Barack Obama funneled tens of thousands of dollars to ACORN, allowing the group to engage in their controversial voter registration activities. Given ACORN's troubling involvement in the presidential election, Barack Obama owes the American people a complete explanation regarding the true nature of his relationship with the group." 
 "Mr. Obama further expanded his list of allies by joining the boards of two well-known charities: the Woods Fund and the Joyce Foundation. These memberships have allowed him to help direct tens of millions of dollars in grants over the years to groups that championed the environment, campaign finance reform, gun control and other causes supported by the liberal network he was cultivating. Mr. Brazier's group, the Woodlawn Organization, received money, for instance, as did antipoverty groups with ties to organized labor like Chicago Acorn, whose endorsement Mr. Obama sought and won in his State Senate race." (Jo Becker and Christopher Drew, "Pragmatic Politics, Forged on the South Side,"

 "One outgrowth of Obama's "community organizer" days in the not-so-leafy urbs of Chicago was serving on the board for the leftist Woods Fund, a major ACORN fertilizer. ACORN is ripe for a pruning, and Obama may have barked up the wrong tree with this group."
