Agreeably to your resolution of the 9th instant, I now lay before you a statement of the circumstances attending the destruction of the frigate 
 with the names of the officers and the number of men employed on the occasion, to which I have to add that Lieutenant Decatur was thereupon advanced to be a captain in the Navy of the United States.
TH: JEFFERSON.
