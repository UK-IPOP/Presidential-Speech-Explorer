I HAVE received Your Excellency's message of January eighteenth. Both Mrs. Hoover and myself were very happy to have the President elect of Mexico and Senora de Ortiz Rubio as our guests. I am most gratified to learn that Senor Ortiz Rubio enjoyed his visit to the United States of America, and I assure Your Excellency that the reception which he received here may be taken as indicating the feeling of friendship which the Government and people of this country bear toward their sister Republic of Mexico.
HERBERT HOOVER
[His Excellency Emilio Portes Gil, Provisional President of Mexico, Mexico City]
