With the camera running almost 24/7, our camera guys got some pretty interesting (and funny) Jeb moments â€” no cutting, slicing, music, or effects included. Here's some of the highlights from 2015:
Jeb's late-night channel surfing landed him smack in the middle of one of the finest films of our time. Sharks are raining from the sky, the Washington Monument is falling down and Mark Cuban is president of the United States.
Just drop his beat. Jeb knows what to do.
Jeb gives a master class on the art of the selfie. Spoiler alert: if you don't have a long enough arm, he might take your phone.
Jeb turns on the Southern charm in the Palmetto State, asking for one woman's vote and handing out his email address.
Being a millennial shouldn't prevent you from wearing your Reagan-Bush '84 shirt. But Jeb will have something to say about it, brother.
