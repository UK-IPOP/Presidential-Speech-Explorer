 the people of our Nation, believing in the dignity and worth of every individual, feel particular concern for the health and welfare of our children; and
 our national aim is to assure to every child the chance to develop those physical, spiritual, emotional, and mental qualities that make for individual happiness and responsible citizenship; and
 we are dedicated to the achievement of that ambition, through democratic processes, for all our children; and
 we are dedicated to the achievement of that ambition, through democratic processes, for all our children; and
 the great advances in knowledge and practice made in the last half century in assuring better health and security to our children have benefited great numbers but have not yet reached all; and
 we propose to examine our achievements and our shortcomings in regard to child care at the Midcentury White House Conference on Children and Youth, to be held in December 1950, and to arrive at the greatest possible agreement on how we can demonstrate our determination to give every child the best possible start in life; and
 the congress, by a joint resolution of May 18, 1928 (45 Stat. 617), authorized and requested the President of the United States to issue annually a proclamation setting apart May 1 as Child Health Day:
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate May 1, 1950, as Child Health Day; and I urge all citizens, individually and in their community, State, and national preparations for the Midcentury White House Conference on Children and Youth, to consider on that day the needs of children in their own communities and States and the best ways of meeting those needs.
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 19th day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-fourth.
