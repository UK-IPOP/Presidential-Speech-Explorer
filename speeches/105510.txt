In advance of Thursday's debate in Orlando, the Romney for President campaign released a series of questions for Governor Rick Perry about his proposal to "let the states [decide] how to run the pensions." Questions about Perry's proposal to return Social Security to the states have so far gone unanswered.
"This election is about choices and voters – and voters will have the opportunity to choose between Mitt Romney, who wants to fix and strengthen Social Security for the next generation, and Rick Perry, who wants to dismantle it. Voters are now learning more about Rick Perry's position on Social Security and find it troubling that he has refused to answer questions on what the Social Security program would look like at the state level, as Rick Perry suggests. Governor Perry has the opportunity to clarify his proposal while he is in Florida – a state with an extraordinarily high number of retirees and near retirees," said Gail Gitcho, Romney Communications Director.
