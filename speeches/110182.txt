Today I am in Ohio, in the midst of a long day of campaigning. I'll shake hundreds of hands, speak before thousands of supporters and crisscross the Buckeye state seeking votes. I'll talk about big issues, listen and share my conservatism with every open heart.

Despite being outspent 12-to-1 by the Romney machine we are polling ahead in Oklahoma, Tennessee and neck and neck in Ohio. We aren't taking anything for granted though because we've been here before and know what it takes to win.
Our volunteers are making thousands of get out the vote calls. Our campaign is knocking on doors and sharing our principled, conservative vision for America. And we are defending ourselves from the lies, distortions and desperate attacks from our rivals.
We are working harder than every other campaign but we still need your help. We need the resources to reach voters and defend ourselves from negative attacks.

So don't wait. Please 
 to help me win a game-changing victory on Super Tuesday - the clock is ticking!
