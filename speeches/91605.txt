 Q: "Senator Levin, Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said that the Iraqi parliament ought to oust Prime Minister Maliki and his government for being politically unable to deliver political unity… I'm wondering what your reaction is to Senator Levin's comment…" THE PRESIDENT: "…I think there's a certain level of frustration with the leadership in general, inability to work – to come to get, for example, an oil revenue law passed or provincial elections." (Joint Press Availability With President Bush, Canadian Prime Minister Harper, and Mexican President Calderon, Montebello, Canada, 8/21/07)
 "Trying to underscore the administration's commitment to al-Maliki, National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe told reporters that Bush continued to have confidence in the prime minister and that his level of support had not changed. 'President Bush believes that Prime Minister Maliki and the presidency council are going to be able to come together and reach some sort of political accommodation,' Johndroe said. 'He certainly urges them to do so every time he speaks with them.'" (Deb Riechmann, "Bush Says It Is Up To Iraqi People To Determine The Fate Of Their Government,"
