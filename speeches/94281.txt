With our economy slipping into recession, American families need a President who will fight for their economic interests from day one. For seven years, President Bush has put the needs of special interests first. Hillary believes we need to put power back with families who need help the most. For 35 years, she has been fighting for working families, and has experience fighting tough battles against the insurance companies and drug companies â€“ including for universal health care in the 1990s. As President, she will again take on the special interests and restore the voices of working families.
