Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Mr. Kimball.
Fortunately, to an audience from southern California and a group of Democrats, I don't have to explain what the issues are in this campaign or what the great issue is.
I will merely say that I am most grateful for your help. I don't think there is a single State of the Union where we are better organized; I don't think there is a single State of the Union where the challenge is greater.
As I said when I came into this State on the Oregon border, I think California is the place to win this election.
I appreciate your help. Thank you. [Applause.]
