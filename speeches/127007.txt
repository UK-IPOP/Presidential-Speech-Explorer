We are endorsing Marco Rubio today because he shares Mississippi's conservative values. Marco is a solid conservative who believes in the right to life, strong national defense, and lower taxes on hardworking American families.

Mississippi Republicans are not going to allow our party to be taken over by a con man like Donald Trump who would get destroyed in the general election. We need a nominee who will stand up for our principles while also persuading people who are not traditionally Republicans to join our cause. The stakes are too high for America to give liberals another four years in control of the White House, which is why we must nominate Marco Rubio, the candidate Hillary Clinton fears the most.
