Hillary Clinton's campaign today announced it will report $36 million in total receipts for the first fundraising quarter, which ended March 31, 2007. The staggering number reflects the strength of support for Clinton from every walk of life and every part of America.
"We are overwhelmed by the tremendous enthusiasm and historic response this campaign has received so far," campaign manager Patti Solis Doyle said today. "Going forward we are poised to continue this success and make even more history."
Specifically, the campaign noted several key numbers demonstrating the overwhelming depth and breadth of Clinton's support:
In March of 2003, the highest total reported by a Democratic campaign in its first-quarter fundraising report was $7.4 million and the top four candidates combined raised just over $23 million. In March of 1999, incumbent Vice President Al Gore reported $8.9 million for his first quarter.
