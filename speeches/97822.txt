ARLINGTON, VA -- Today, McCain-Palin 2008 released its latest television ad, entitled "Sweat Equity."

The ad highlights small business owners from across the country sharing in the same concerns that Joe the Plumber expressed last week that they cannot afford Barack Obama's tax increases seeking to redistribute the wealth by punishing small businesses for expanding and creating jobs. The ad will be televised in key states.
