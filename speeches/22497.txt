 under the provisions of section 202(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, each independent country, self-governing dominion, mandated territory, and territory under the international trusteeship system of the United Nations, other than independent countries of North, Central, and South America, is entitled to be treated as a separate quota area when approved by the Secretary of State; and
 under the provisions of section 201(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Attorney General, jointly, are required to determine the annual quota of any quota area established pursuant to the provisions of section 202(a) of the said Act, and to report to the President the quota of each quota area so determined; and
 under the provisions of section 202(e) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Attorney General, jointly, are required to revise the quotas, whenever necessary, to provide for any political changes requiring a change in the list of quota areas; and
 under the provisions of section 202(e) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, the annual quota of any newly established quota area shall be not less than the sum total of quotas in effect or number of visas authorized to be issued immediately preceding the change in boundaries, change of administrative arrangements, or other political change requiring a change in the list of quota areas; and
 on July 3, 1962, the United States extended formal diplomatic recognition to Algeria as a sovereign independent state; and
 on October 9, 1962, the former. British protectorate of Uganda was granted independence by the government of the United Kingdom; and
 on May 1, 1963, full administrative responsibility for Irian Barat (former West New Guinea) was transferred to the Republic of Indonesia by the United Nations; and
 the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce and the Attorney General have jointly determined and reported to me the immigration quotas hereinafter set forth:
 President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the aforesaid Act of Congress, do hereby proclaim and make known that the annual immigration quotas of the quota areas hereinafter designated have been determined in accordance with the law to be, and shall be, as follows:

Algeria ------------------ 574

Uganda ------------------- 100

Indonesia ---------------- 200
The establishment of an immigration quota for any quota area is solely for the purpose of compliance with the pertinent provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act and is not to be considered as having any significance extraneous to such purpose.
Proclamation No. 3293 of June 3, 1959, as amended, entitled “Immigration Quotas," is further amended by the addition of the quotas for Algeria and Uganda and by the revision of the quota for Indonesia.
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this seventh day of January in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-eighth.
