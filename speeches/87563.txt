 In his State of the Union Address, President Bush set a goal of reducing America's gasoline consumption by 20 percent over the next 10 years. This goal requires progress on two fronts: we must reform fuel economy standards for cars to make our use of gasoline more efficient, and we must harness the power of technology to increase the use of alternative fuels like ethanol.
 We are changing the way America generates electricity by investing in clean-coal technology, wind and solar power, and clean, safe nuclear power. We are also increasing funding for research and development into alternatives to oil and gasoline, including advanced batteries for plug-in and hybrid cars, biodiesel fuels, and hydrogen fuel cells. New technologies like these have the potential to provide reliable energy at competitive prices.
 President Bush called on Congress and all Americans to join him in pursuing the goal of reducing U.S. gasoline usage, which will help increase our Nation's energy security by reducing our dependence on oil. Achieving this goal will also help address climate change concerns by slowing the projected growth of carbon dioxide emissions from cars, light trucks, and SUVs.
