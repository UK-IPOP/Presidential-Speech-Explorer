THE House passage of the IDA bill is a major victory for the American people, for an effective foreign policy and for commonsense in our international dealings. This measure is bipartisan in its origins and I congratulate those members of both parties who joined in advancing it a step closer to reality.
It may have taken two tries but a worthwhile cause has won a significant success. We will always continue to try when the cause is just.
