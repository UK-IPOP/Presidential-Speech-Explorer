I AM confident that I speak not only for myself but for the people of the United States in expressing appreciation for your message on this first anniversary of the signing of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1948.
The record of the countries participating in the European recovery program during the past year is one of great accomplishment in industry, in agriculture, in trade. It is a record of tireless hard work. It is also, I believe, a record of achievement through cooperation. The Organization for European Economic Cooperation so recently established by the countries working together toward full recovery has demonstrated to us all the meaning of true international action.
We in the United States are proud that we have had a part in this great mutual effort. We are confident that the progress toward true recovery which has been so marked during this first year will continue and that the high goals which have been set will be fully realized.
