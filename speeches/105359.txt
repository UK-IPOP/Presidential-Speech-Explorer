In case you missed it:
Part fan-for-a-day and part politician, Bachmann brilliantly mastered the art of retail politics. She delighted in the time-honored tradition of holding babies and posing for photos with kids and toasted tailgaters alike.  
The winner of the 2012 Ames Straw Poll was thronged by media and supporters as she made her way to a tailgate outside of State Sen. Jack Whitver's RV, where she proceeded to serve burgers and pose for photos.  
The Iowa born-and-raised Bachmann wore a special football jersey that included the colors of the rival Cyclones and Hawkeyes. She met enthusiastic supporters throughout the tailgate parking lots.  Three other Bachmann supporters, State Senators Mark Chelgren (R-Ottumwa), Brad Zaun (R-Urbandale) and Kent Sorenson (R-Indianola), also joined Bachmann as she mingled with crowds outside Jack Trice Stadium Saturday morning.
