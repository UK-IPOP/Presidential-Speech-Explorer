 On Wednesday, when I was briefed on the balloon, I ordered the Pentagon to shoot it down, on Wednesday, as soon as possible. They decided—without doing damage to anyone on the ground. They decided that the best time to do that was as it got over water, outside—within our—within the 12-mile limit.
They successfully took it down. And I want to compliment our aviators who did it. And we'll have more to report on this a little later.
Thank you.
 Your saying the recommendation was from the Pentagon?
Mr. President, what does this say about China?
 [
]—the Chinese?
What's your message to China?
You were saying the recommendation from your—was from your national security——
 I told them to shoot it down.
On Wednesday?
 On Wednesday.
But the recommendation from them——
 They said to me, "Let's wait till the safest place to do it."
 What does this mean for China—relations with China?
Are you worried about provoking the Chinese, sir?
