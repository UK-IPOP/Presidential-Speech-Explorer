 Perhaps even more importantly, he has emerged as the candidate representing the "Governors' wing" (read: problem-solvers) of the Republican party, as opposed to the "Washington wing" (read: gridlock). This makes him eminently electable in November...
... National and international leadership based on rage or anger really doesn't represent anything different than the poisonous atmosphere we have today in Washington.
With John Kasich as our president, we would get the best of both worlds. Kasich knows how to break the back of Washington gridlock becaus he's done it. Remember that it was Kasich who talked Congress and Bill Clinton into not only balancing the federal budget, but into ending welfare as it had existed for decades.
Kasich is as upset and angry as other Republicans about what's happening to our nation, and our failure to solve our major problems. But Kasich does not give in to the temptation to use vicious rhetoric, because he has the seasoning and the wisdom to know that once you're elected, campaigning that way makes progress after the election far more difficult.
