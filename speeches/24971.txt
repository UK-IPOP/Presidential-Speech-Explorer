MY APPOINTMENT of Dr. Keppel recognizes his outstanding performance over the past 3 years in helping meet the greatest education tasks of the Nation. His promotion to the new position of Assistant Secretary will enable him better to serve the needs of the Department and to stimulate education activities that do not lie strictly within the jurisdiction of the Office of Education.
This leadership is made even more necessary by the new legislation for elementary, secondary, and higher education passed by the 89th Congress. The programs of the Office of Education have expanded 25-fold over the past decade. The total activities of the Federal Government in the field of education have tripled during the past 4 years. I am determined that these programs shall be administered wisely and well. This has highest priority for Dr. Francis Keppel.
