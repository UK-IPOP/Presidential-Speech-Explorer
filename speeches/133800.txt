Under President Trump, unemployment has hit and remained at near-record lows, and businesses are facing labor shortages.


The United States unemployment rate has remained at 4.1 percent for the third straight month, which is the lowest level since 2000.

The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate has not exceeded 4.8 percent during President Trump's tenure.

According to a January 2018 survey released by the Federal Reserve, businesses across the country are having challenges finding enough workers to fill the quality jobs that are available.  
Despite labor market shortages, welfare enrollment has remained at or near-historic highs.


In 2016, over 16 million able-bodied adults were enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

In January 2018, over 74 million Americans were enrolled in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), a 29 percent increase over the 2013 baseline period.

Today, there are a record 28 million able-bodied adults on Medicaid. In fact, since 2000, the number of able-bodied adults on Medicaid has quadrupled.
