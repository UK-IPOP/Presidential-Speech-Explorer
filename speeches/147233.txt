There are two Operation Fly Formula flights currently scheduled for the week of July 4, projected to import approximately 3.2 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of infant formula to the United States. By July 10, Operation Fly Formula flights will have completed 39 flights and imported more than 43 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of infant formula.
Under Operation Fly Formula, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the General Services Administration (GSA) are partnering to import infant formula from other nations that meets U.S. health and safety standards, so it can get to store shelves faster.
