"In President Obama's imaginary recovery the 'middle class is coming back' and the 'private sector is doing fine.' But struggling families aren't living in the same world, with stagnant unemployment, shrinking household incomes, and a crippling national debt that will burden the next generation. As president, Mitt Romney will actually deliver a middle-class recovery with 12 million new jobs and higher take-home pay." – Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman

 "The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits climbed last week to a one-month high, showing little progress in the labor market. Jobless claims rose by 4,000 for a second week to reach 372,000 in the period ended Aug. 18 ... The four-week moving average, a less volatile measure, increased to 368,000. ... 'It's still very sluggish, and growth itself is implying we should not see any acceleration in hiring at this point,' Yelena Shulyatyeva, a U.S. economist at BNP Paribas in New York, said before the report. ... The Labor Department revised the previous week's figure up to 368,000 from an initially reported 366,000." ("Jobless Claims In U.S. Climb For Second Week To One-Month High,"

 "The downbeat short-term perspective is not surprising in light of the heavy economic blows delivered by the Great Recession of 2007-2009 and the sluggish recovery since. About four-in-ten (42%) middle-class adults say their household's financial situation is worse now than it was before the recession, while 32% say they are in better shape; an additional 23% volunteered that their finances are unchanged."

 "After four years of college, many graduates are ending up in jobs that only require the ability to operate a cash register with a smile. After commencement, a growing number young people say they have no choice but to take low-skilled jobs, according to a survey released this week. And while 63% of 'Generation Y' workers — those age 18 to 29 — have a bachelor's degree, the majority of the jobs taken by graduates don't require one, according to an online survey of 500,000 young workers carried out between July 2011 and July 2012 by

 "Almost equally challenging for small-business owners is 'Uncertainty over Government Actions' which ranks fourth and is critical for 35 percent. In the last four years, the federal government approved legislation to overhaul the financial industry, the healthcare system and promote economic stimulus. The upheaval in policy changes is immense and will continue as the regulatory system works to implement the laws' directives. In addition to the headline reform efforts, regulators of other government agencies are also broadening rulemaking efforts in areas of employment and the environment."

 "'Environmental Regulations' leads the list of those problems moving up the ranking with a 20 percentage point climb from the 47th to 27th position. Small-business owners clearly felt the change in regulatory policy over the last four years. The severity of this problem differs greatly by industry, but across the board, all industries rank this issue as more severe than four years ago and find it more critical."
