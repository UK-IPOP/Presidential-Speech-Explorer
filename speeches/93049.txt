SIGOURNEY, IA-- New Mexico Governor and Democratic Presidential candidate Bill Richardson today unveiled his mortgage and credit markets policy in Keokuk County, Iowa. Iowa has had approximately 7,500 foreclosures in the past year.
"People are not looking for handouts, they are looking for honesty," Richardson said. "Americans are working hard and playing by the rules, but the rules do not work anymore. We must change them.
"When Congress passed harsh Bankruptcy 'Reform' in 2005, it left working families, children, and widows to deal with the worst practices of credit card companies and predatory lenders. We need a President who will be on the side of hardworking Americans facing foreclosures and financial disaster, not the financial industry."
In 2003, Richardson signed the Home Loan Protection Act in New Mexico. As a result, New Mexico has the lowest foreclosure rate in its region and one of the lowest in the country. Today Richardson proposed implementing that policy nationwide.
"Almost five years ago, we saw that the rules were wrong," Richardson said. "We saw that they protected big lenders, not the big dreams of hardworking Americans. We saw that they promoted unfair practices, so I did something about it."
Richardson also talked about fighting homelessness among our nation's veterans.
"It is absolutely unacceptable that one-third of the homeless on our streets are veterans," Richardson said. "We have to take serious and immediate steps to address this issue and honor those who have served our country. In New Mexico, I created the HERO program to help active-duty military members, teachers, police officers, fire fighters, and nurses buy their own homes."
