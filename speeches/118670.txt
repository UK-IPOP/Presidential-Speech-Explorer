In Iowa last weekend, Marco joined David Brody from CBN News for a wide-ranging interview, which included a conversation about how Marco prioritizes his family life.

So what are Marco's most important jobs?


"I believe that generally speaking. I believe that at home my most important job is to be a husband to my wife and a father to my children. If I can't do that right, I can't lead a nation. If you can't lead your family, you can't lead a country. So obviously, it's an important aspect of it. 
 It's important for me to do those jobs right first."
