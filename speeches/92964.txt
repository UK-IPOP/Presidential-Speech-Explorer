, Posted 11/28/07)
 "[Romney] came across serious and conservative." (Mary Katharine Ham, "Who Won?," 
, 11/28/07)
 "... I thought Romney got the better of that [immigration] exchange. It's one thing to use Romney's illegal immigrant lawn care workers in a joke, but it's another thing to try and base a serious criticism on that." (Philip Klein, "Sanctuary Mansion," 
, 11/28/07)
 "In the opening minutes, Romney and Rudy Giuliani sparred over illegal immigration... 
, challenging Giuliani on his charge and the sometimes vocal audience sounded a note of apparent disapproval at the mayor's line of attack." (Vaughn Ververs, "Romney Battles, Huckabee Shines In GOP Debate," CBS' Horserace '08 Blog, 
, Posted 11/28/07)
 "Romney gets the edge here, especially for beating Rudy Giuliani like a bongo drum on immigration." (Ed Morrissey, "CNN/YouTube Debate â€“ CNN Wins," Captain's Quarters,

, Accessed 11/28/07)
 "[Gov. Romney] showed more humility by saying several times he was wrong, that he isn't perfect, that he hasn't always made the right decisions. It worked a lot better for him." (Philip Klein, "Romney's Abortion Flip-Flop Answer," 
, 11/28/07)
 "I agree with most of the posters at The Corner that Mitt is doing very, very well." (Townhall.com, 
 Accessed 11/28/07)
 "Mitt Romney talked about education as the next civil right...Liberals have failed inner city blacks overwhelmingly in the last 30 years. That's why the question from the father and son was so pertinent and I thought Romney did a good job on it." (CNN's "Post Debate Coverage," 11/28/07)
 "... I grew up in the inner city, in public schools. The plight of those who live there is real, sad, and cannot often be solved by the Nanny State. Romney focuses on families, empowerment, police protection in solving black-on-black crime, and invokes Bill Cosby. Well done. It addressed the question directly and treated the questioners' concerns with respect. It was a serious answer with real application, not a flippant appeal to the family values crowd that would have made him look disconnected, which it easily could have been." (Mary Katharine Ham, "Romney's Winner Answer on Black-on-Black Crime," Townhall.com, 
, 11/28/07)
 "Romney's answer is pretty good; family's important, of course it is" (James G. Poulos, "Black On Black Crime,"
