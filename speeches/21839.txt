Dear Mr. Prime Minister:
On the occasion of the independence of the Republic of Upper Volta, I extend in my own name and on behalf of the United States most cordial greetings and felicitations to you and the people of the Upper Volta.
The accession to independence of the Upper Volta is a source of great satisfaction to the United States, especially since this freedom was achieved in friendly cooperation with France.
On this historic day the Government and people of the United States look forward to close and friendly relations with the Government and people of the Upper Volta.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
