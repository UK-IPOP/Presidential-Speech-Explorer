Today marks the one-year anniversary of the tax relief that President Bush promised the American people and delivered in full -- the largest tax reduction in a generation.

The economy is much stronger one year after the tax cut but there is still more work to be done to ensure long-term growth, a job for every American worker and a return to budget surpluses. And, to keep us on the path to long term recovery, Congress should make the tax cuts permanent; give the President Trade Promotion Authority, a comprehensive energy bill and a terrorism bill; and hold spending down.

Workers started getting checks in late July, 2001, pumping $40 billion back into the economy and boosting consumer spending at a critical time.

Our economy is much stronger today than it was a year ago:
