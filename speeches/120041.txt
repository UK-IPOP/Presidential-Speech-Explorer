Later today, Vice President Biden will deliver remarks at the Ohio State University about the importance of preventing sexual assault on college and university campuses across the country. The event will highlight the 
 public awareness and bystander intervention campaign, which seeks to engage students and all members of campus communities in changing the culture to prevent sexual assault.

Ø Today, the Task Force announces the release of 
, a resource kit for campus health centers. This set of training materials was developed by the National Center on Safe Supportive Learning Environments Technical Assistance Center for the U.S. Department of Education. It is designed to foster the development of campus health center environments that are rooted in an understanding of trauma and responsive to the needs of all students, especially survivors of sexual assault. The resource kit provides health center managers and staff with concrete materials to understand trauma, review the physical environment, assess clinical encounters, and evaluate relevant policies and procedures of the center in order to improve the delivery of care and promote trauma-sensitive practice. The materials include self-paced e-learning modules, implementation guides, templates, and checklists.

Ø On September 19, 2015, the Administration celebrates the one-year anniversary of

In January 2014, President Obama established the White House Task Force to Protect Students From Sexual Assault to ensure that all students – women and men – are protected, and to support educational institutions as they seek to cultivate learning environments of safety and equality. Just three months after its creation, the Task Force released 
, a report on Federal activities and resources to address campus sexual assault. Over the last year and a half since the 
 release, the Task Force has participated in an exchange of ideas and opportunities to engage student leaders, school representatives, advocates, policymakers, and other critical stakeholders on a variety of fronts, including: campus safety, bystander intervention, fair process and procedures, and trauma-informed responses to sexual violence. Through this exchange, the Task Force has utilized a multidisciplinary and collaborative approach to offer tools and guidance to enhance schools' prevention, education, response, and enforcement practices. These resources are contained in the above Resource Guide and are also available on the Task Force's website:
