IT IS always a pleasure, Mr. Watson, to receive you at any time and especially so when you are engaged in such a worthwhile endeavor as the Boy Scouts. It is always a pleasure to hear about scouting. It is a fine example that a man of your stature and leadership would find time in your busy life to give leadership to such a worthwhile movement as this.
It is thrilling to have these fine examples of young manhood here. They are fine figures and we are glad to see you.
