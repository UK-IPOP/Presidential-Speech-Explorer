To His Majesty The King of the Belgians:
I am deeply moved by Your Majesty's tribute to the memory of those of my countrymen who gave their lives in the great cause and whose bodies rest in Belgian soil. All Americans with one accord thank Your Majesty and the Belgian people for this evidence of affection and for the Belgian flowers which tomorrow will lie on American graves.
HERBERT HOOVER
