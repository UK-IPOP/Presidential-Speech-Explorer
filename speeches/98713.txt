 We support the Pakistani government as it moves forward with reforms that will deliver the benefits of democracy to the Pakistani people.
 Over the past year, Pakistan has experienced a sharp 70 percent increase in staple food prices. The United States will work to provide a major food security assistance package of over $115 million responding to short and long-term needs. This is consistent with the President's approach to addressing global food security by meeting immediate needs and investing in long-term solutions.
 The United States and Pakistan will continue economic dialogue on August 11, including discussion of the status of ongoing bilateral investment treaty negotiations, with energy and trade dialogues planned for the fall.
 This amounts to $4.8 billion over the past three years â€“ and over $11 billion total since 2001. This includes Coalition Support Funds, Security Assistance, and Humanitarian/Economic Aid.
