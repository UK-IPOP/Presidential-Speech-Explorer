"President Obama has had three and a half years to keep his campaign promise to grow the economy and create jobs. Now, with record-level unemployment and job creation that even the president calls inadequate, it is clear his policies haven't worked. Americans know we aren't moving in the right direction today, and they can't afford more of the same. As president, Mitt Romney will enact a pro-growth agenda that gets our economy back on track and allows our small businesses and job creators to thrive." â€“Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
