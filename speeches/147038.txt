Air Force One was wheels down at 3:09 PM local time Wednesday at Ben Gurion Airport.
Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan gaggled during the flight. That should have been played on White House live.
John Kirby came back after the gaggle. He said that Jake Sullivan misspoke when asked about reopening a consulate in east Jerusalem. He said the US is "interested in looking into a consulate in Jerusalem." He said Sullivan meant to say Jerusalem not East Jerusalem per US policy.
The president is set to give remarks at an arrival ceremony at the airport. Then he will receive a briefing at the airport on the Iron Dome and Iron Beam Air Defense systems from the Minister of Defense. After that he will visit the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum in Jerusalem.
President Biden exited Air Force One at 3:29 PM.
A large welcome ceremony was set up on the tarmac with a red carpet rolled out to the steps of AF1, rows of military and law enforcement officials lined up, a band and US and Israeli flags waving in front of a grandstand.
Prime Minister Yair Lapid and other officials waited for Biden at the bottom of the steps. A full list of the officials from the White House is below.
