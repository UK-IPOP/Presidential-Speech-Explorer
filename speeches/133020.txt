A majority of the Nation's State Attorneys General are urging the United States Senate to confirm Judge Kavanaugh, describing him as "an outstanding jurist with a proven commitment to upholding the Constitution and the rule of law."


Yale students, alumni, and faculty signed a letter highlighting Judge Kavanaugh as "a faithful servant to his community" and praising him as "one of our nation's most distinguished jurists."
