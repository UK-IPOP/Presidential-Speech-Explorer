 Hello, Mr. President.
 Congratulations on your victory. I was assured of your victory much in advance. [

 You knew about it before I did, then.
 Mr. President, did your meeting with Prime Minister Hashimoto produce any expectation of reducing the trade imbalance?
 We've made a lot of progress in the last 4 years. And we spent a lot of time on trade in that meeting, and he reaffirmed his willingness to resolve the remaining disputes between us. But if the economy keeps growing in Japan, that should help us reduce the trade imbalance.
 Mr. President, are you optimistic that perhaps the four-way talks that were proposed can actually get underway?
 Well, we're going to talk about that.
 But didn't you talk about it in your meet ing with the Chinese leader?
 Absolutely, I did. Thank you.
