"The middle class has been crushed by the Obama economy. And today's sluggish jobs report reinforced what Americans already knew — we can't afford another four years like the last four years. Manufacturing is in decline and 23 million Americans are still struggling for work. Mitt Romney will deliver a real recovery, with 12 million new jobs and higher take-home pay for American workers." — Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman
 "That's because as the country's economy slowly improves, more people who traditionally work in manufacturing, logistics, or other professions that don't require a college degree are increasingly dropping out of the labor force and giving up looking for work."

 "Little help for the long-term unemployed: The good news on unemployment didn't extend to those hardest hit by the recession, the long-term unemployed. The average length of unemployment rose to 39.8 weeks, reversing August's slight improvement. Two out of every five job seekers has now been out of work for over six months, a figure that's improved little during the recovery." (

 "There are still 12.1 million unemployed people in the United States and an additional 2.5 million people who would like jobs but are too discouraged to look. Within that group, there are still 4.8 million people who have been jobless for at least 27 weeks. The labor market is still very, very far from healthy."(Brad Plumer, "September Jobs Report: Why The Drop To 7.8% Unemployment Is Good News,"

 "'The economy seems since the recovery began to have three gears,' said Patrick O'Keefe, a labor economist and director of economic research at J. H. Cohn, an accounting firm, 'slow, idle and reverse. It's stuck in slow. We don't have a gear faster than slow.'" (

 CNBC'S BRIAN SULLIVAN: "It's not good news for the economy because as we've talked about you really need 125,000 jobs created a month to keep up with population and immigration growth." (MSNBC's "Morning Joe," 10/5/12)

 "In contrast to the sclerosis and joblessness of the past three years, the Romney plan offers an economic U-turn in ideas and choices. When bolstered by sound trade, education, energy and monetary policy, the Romney reform program is expected by the governor's economic advisers to increase GDP growth by between 0.5% and 1% per year over the next decade. It should also speed up the current recovery, enabling the private sector to create 200,000 to 300,000 jobs per month, or about 12 million new jobs in a Romney first term, and millions more after that due to the plan's long-run growth effects."  (Glenn Hubbard, Op-Ed, "The Romney Plan For Economic Recovery,"

 "Reform the nation's tax code to increase growth and job creation. The Romney plan would reduce individual marginal income tax rates across the board by 20%, while keeping current low tax rates on dividends and capital gains. The governor would also reduce the corporate income tax rate—the highest in the world—to 25%. In addition, he would broaden the tax base to ensure that tax reform is revenue-neutral." (Glenn Hubbard, Op-Ed, "The Romney Plan For Economic Recovery,"

 "The governor's plan would reduce federal spending as a share of GDP to 20%—its pre-crisis average—by 2016. This would dramatically reduce policy uncertainty over the need for future tax increases, thus increasing business and consumer confidence. ... The governor's plan would remove regulatory impediments to energy production and innovation that raise costs to consumers and limit new job creation."
