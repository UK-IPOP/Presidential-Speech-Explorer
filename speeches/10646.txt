My dear Chairman Fletcher:
I have your letter of November 17th tendering your resignation as Chairman of the United States Tariff Commission, to be effective November 30th.
In accepting it I wish to express the keen appreciation I have for the great public service you have rendered. Under your Chairmanship the work of the Commission has made great progress in consummation of the hopes which were placed in its reorganization and increased authority. That a large number of cases have been considered and disposed of and the heavy docket for the year almost completed, all bespeak the devotion and effectiveness of the Commission's work.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Hon. Henry P. Fletcher, U.S. Tariff Commission, Washington, D.C.]
