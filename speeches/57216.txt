The Administration supports enactment of H.R. 5087 provided that the pay-as-you-go cost of the bill is fully offset as required by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA).



H.R. 5087 would affect direct spending; therefore it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of OBRA. Scoring estimates are currently under development.
