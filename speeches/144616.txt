Yesterday, dozens of state and local leaders and organizations across the country praised President Joe Biden's proposed investments in the American Families Plan to create a national comprehensive paid family and medical leave program. Governors, mayors, state lawmakers from across the country highlighted the urgent need to support workers and families by making this critical investment to promote equity – and in turn, strength – of our economy.
: "Like @SecMartyWalsh said, paid family and medical leave ensures that no person has to make the choice between saving the life of a loved one or their life savings." [

The option to take leave to tend to a sick family member, care for a newborn, or grieve the loss of a loved one should be a right –– not a luxury. Thank you to @POTUS for prioritizing paid leave for all workers in the American Families Plan." [

 "Workers lost $22.5 billion in wages last year because we're missing critical social infrastructure. Parental paid leave has been shown to keep mothers in the workforce, increase labor force participation and boost economic growth. As we head out of this pandemic, we've seen first-hand that our social safety net is filled with holes. The rich & powerful tend to be fine when their business goes under, but when working people need parental or medical leave, it regularly halts their career. Investing in our families is a top priority of mine and the American Families Plan will do just that. Creating a comprehensive paid leave program that provides up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave, I'm proud to support the AFP and hope our congressional delegation will do the right thing for working Hoosiers. #AmericanFamiliesPlan" [
