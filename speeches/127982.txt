"After spending his entire career — and this entire campaign — demeaning women and dismissing the need to support working families, Donald Trump released a regressive and insufficient 'maternity leave' policy that is out-of-touch, half-baked and ignores the way Americans live and work today. Instead of asking those at the top to pay their fair share, he's robbing Peter to pay Paul by raiding unemployment insurance funds, and giving the most to the wealthy while providing far less relief to middle-class and working families. The lack of seriousness of this proposal is no surprise given his history of disrespecting women in the workplace and the fact there's no evidence he ever provided paid family leave or childcare to his own employees. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton — who has a lifelong record of fighting for women and families — has a comprehensive plan that will support 21st century families."
 "The Trump plan will guarantee six weeks of paid maternity leave by amending the existing unemployment insurance (UI) that companies are required to carry. The benefit would apply only when employers don't offer paid maternity leave, and would be paid for by offsetting reductions in the program so that taxes are not raised."
 "The Trump plan will rewrite the tax code to allow working parents to deduct from their income taxes child care expenses for up to four children and elderly dependents…Individuals who have no tax liability…will claim an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit, equivalent to half of their payroll tax contribution."
 "The Trump plan would create new Dependent Care Savings Accounts (DCSAs) so that families can set aside extra money to foster their children's development and offset elder care for their parents or adult dependents. These new accounts are available to everyone, and allow both tax-deductible contributions and tax-free appreciation year-to-year."
 "The Daily Beast reached out to the Trump presidential campaign, the Trump Organization, and Ivanka Trump, to ask about the family leave policy at the Trump Organization. A representative from Ivanka Trump's brand replied quickly to say that employees of the former model's small fashion and lifestyle shop were provided with eight weeks of paid leave… 'In addition, since we have flexible working hours with a focus on results rather than face time, we are supportive of all working moms who some days may need or choose to work from home,' she said. 'My colleague Melissa, cc'd, can advise on Trump Org.' After three follow-up emails, Melissa from the Trump Organization wrote back: 'We will have no further comment.'" [Daily Beast,

 "As an alternative to the tight-lipped corporate communications department, The Daily Beast reached out to over 100 former employees to ask about the company's family-leave policy…Of the nine ex-employees who were willing to speak, only one was able to recall any maternity leave—in this instance, it was apparently unpaid leave—being offered at the company, although none of them could say conclusively that no such leave was offered."

 "Donald Trump doesn't understand why so few companies provide affordable, in-house child care for their employees like he does at some of his companies. 'It's not expensive for a company to do it,' Trump said during a town hall at a community college in this small town on Thursday afternoon. 'You need one person or two people, and you need some blocks and you need some swings and some toys. You know, surely, it's not expensive. It's not an expensive thing. I do it all over, and I get great people because of it... It's something that can be done, I think, very easily by a company.'" [Washington Post,

 "But the two programs Trump cited — 'Trump Kids' and 'Trumpeteers' — are programs catering to patrons of Trump's hotels and golf club. They are not for Trump's employees, according to staff at Trump's hotels and clubs across the country." [Associated Press,

 "'Do you actually change diapers?' host Anthony Cumia asked Donald Trump on the Opie and Anthony show in November of 2005. The then-59-year-old businessman, whose wife Melania was pregnant with his fifth child and her first, responded bluntly: 'No, I don't do that.'… 'If I had a different type of wife,' Trump said laughing, 'I probably wouldn't have a baby, ya know, cause that's not my thing. I'm really like a great father but certain things you do and certain things you don't. It's just not for me.'" [BuzzFeed,
]; Opie And Anthony Show, 11/06]
 "'There's a lot of women out there that demand that the husband act like the wife and you know there's a lot of husbands that listen to that,' Trump added." [BuzzFeed,
]; Opie And Anthony Show, 11/06]
 "'Cause I like kids,' said Trump. 'I mean, I won't do anything to take care of them. I'll supply funds and she'll take care of the kids. It's not like I'm gonna be walking the kids down Central Park.'" [Buzzfeed, 
; Howard Stern Show, 4/05]
 BRZEZINKI: "So are we at the point where women employees who are mothers aren't as valuable, because we have kids and we balance other things? Or does having children actually increase our value?" TRUMP: "I think the most important thing is the children, and frankly [caring for them means taking] time away, and an employer could say she's not giving one hundred percent, she's giving me eighty-four percent, and sixteen percent is going towards taking care of children. So maybe you can also understand the employer's point of view." [Mika Brzezinski, Knowing Your Value: Women, Money, And Getting What You're Worth, p. 161, 2011; Huffington Post,

 "In an October 2004 interview with NBC's Dateline, Trump said pregnancy is 'a wonderful thing for the woman, it's a wonderful thing for the husband, it's certainly an inconvenience for a business. And whether people want to say that or not, the fact is it is an inconvenience for a person that is running a business.'" [NBC News,

 "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump once called a lawyer who requested a break from a 2011 deposition to pump breast milk 'disgusting' before ending his testimony and leaving the room. 'He got up, his face got red, he shook his finger at me and he screamed, 'You're disgusting, you're disgusting,' and he ran out of there,' Beck told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on Wednesday morning, calling it 'an absolute meltdown.'" [CNN,

 "When Trump was asked about child care late last year by a member of the women's policy organization Make It Work, he mocked the questioner: 'It's a big subject, darling,' he said. 'She wants to know my thoughts on child care. Come on, we'll talk for about 10 hours.'" [Vox,
