Mr. Secretary, Governor Stevenson:
It is a great pleasure to participate once 'again in this inauguration of the new delegation. This is an unusually distinguished group of Americans, Governor, who are going with you to carry out an assignment which is second to none in the field of foreign policy, in the field of national security. I look forward to being with them on Friday.
I think that this country has based great hopes in the United Nations since 1945. This has been particularly true since Governor Stevenson has led our delegation, and I am confident that this year, as in the past, we will break new ground in the effort to provide for a more peaceful world.
So we are glad to welcome them all here and to express appreciation to Members of Congress who are serving and to the other American citizens who are participating in this national effort.
