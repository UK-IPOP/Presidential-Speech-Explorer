[Released October 25, 1931. Dated October 23, 1931]
I AM SADDENED to learn of the death of your husband, Fletcher Hale, in the midst of a career which had already been of great service to his state and to the country. His character and ability made him a highly important member of the highest councils of the nation. Mrs. Hoover and I extend to you and your sons our deepest sympathy in your bereavement.
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mrs. Fletcher Hale, c/o Franklin Fort, 47 South Grove Street, East Orange, N.J.]
