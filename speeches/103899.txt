The President is pleased that the House has joined the Senate to pass the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Improvements Act of 2010. This bill will expand and improve upon the Post 9/11 GI Bill that went into effect last year and it will simplify and improve benefits in a fiscally responsible way. The President strongly believes that our nation has a sacred trust with our veterans and this act will help those who have served their country. Specifically, the Act will enable veterans to now use their benefit for vocational and on-the-job training, expand eligibility for the benefit to National Guardsmen who are activated for domestic assistance, provide Active Duty troops with additional assistance to purchase books, and provide severely injured veterans and their caregivers with additional time to use their benefits.
In particular, the President appreciates the efforts of Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Akaka, Ranking Member Burr and Senator Webb for their leadership on this issue. The Administration will work with Congress to continue to improve this important program and better provide assistance to our veterans.
