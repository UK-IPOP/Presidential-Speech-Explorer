Members of the Stevenson family, Mr. Vice President, the distinguished leadership and Members of the Congress, Postmaster General Gronouski, friends and associates of Adlai Stevenson, ladies and gentlemen:
We meet here today to share an act of remembrance. Less than 2 years ago, Adlai Stevenson took part in a ceremony honoring the memory of Eleanor Roosevelt with a commemorative stamp. He said of her that she was a symbol of man's humanity to man.
So, today, in honoring him we honor another whose life speaks to us of the brighter side of man's nature--the side of service and the love of our fellows.
I will not now add to the many words which have been said in his praise. It is sufficient to know, as Winston Churchill once said, that he has left a lonesome place against the sky.
For almost two decades, Adlai Stevenson skillfully and beautifully helped shape the dialog of 20th century democracy. The possibilities that he revealed, the horizons that he opened, and the dangers of which he warned are today the central concern of the United States of America.

I know they are my concern.
Above all, he taught that the goals of America, and the road we must travel to reach them, could be followed consistently with the most noble of our ideals. Indeed, there could be no other way.
What more can be said of a public man than this: He believed in man. He revealed the prospects of peace. And in his own life he served the cause of mankind just as he so eloquently proclaimed it.
