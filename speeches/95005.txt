The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsements of nearly 50 legislators and community leaders from across Minnesota.
"Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to make change happen from her first day in office," said State Senate President James Metzen.
"Hillary has a detailed plan to jumpstart our economy and rebuild the middle class," said State Director Buck Humphrey. "She has not only a vision for America, but the ability to implement it."
"I am grateful for the overwhelming support I've received in Minnesota," Clinton said. "With the help of these local leaders, we'll continue to bring our message of change across the state over the next two weeks."
