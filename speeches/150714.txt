Hello all,
I'll be your foreign pooler for Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte's (Mark Roo-tuh) visit to the White House.
This will be their first formal bilateral meeting, though they have met several times in the past, including twice last year at the extraordinary NATO summit in Brussels in March and at the NATO summit in Madrid in June.
According to the statement announcing the visit, "Among topics to be discussed: the coordination of support to Ukraine at the political, military and humanitarian level, as well as further cooperation in the fields of defense and security and strengthening of the bilateral trade relationship between the Netherlands and the United States."
On Monday, he tweeted the following: "In preparation for my visit to Washington I spoke with @ZelenskyyUa. The horrific attack on an apartment block in Dnipro underscores just why Russia cannot be allowed to win this war. The coordination of international military support remains essential in the months ahead."
China's access to semiconductors will be part of the discussion, as it was during POTUS' meeting with Japanese PM Kishida on Friday.
During a press conference on Friday, Rutte said that he didn't feel pressure from US to adopt more restrictions on semiconductor exports to China: "This is a terrain where we're a world player and we can conduct discussions about it without immediately talking in terms ... of being 'put under pressure'. I don't experience it like that at all."
The Netherlands is a key player in the global semiconductor chain because it is home to ASML, the company that produces the high-tech machines that make the most advanced chips.
On Sunday, Trade minister Liesje Schreinemacher said: "We've been talking with the Americans for a long time, but they came up with new rules in October, so that changes the playing field." "you can't say that they've been pressuring us for two years and now we have to sign on the dotted line. And we won't."
There's a growing trade dispute between the US and the EU over the impact of the IRA on european economies, specifically the plan to favor US-made green technology through heavy subsidies which, according to the EU, will unfairly discriminate against european companies. This was already a point of contention during French President Macron's state visit in December. At the time, POTUS said about the plan "there's obviously going to be glitches in it…"So there's tweaks that we can make that can fundamentally make it easier for European countries to participate."
The upcoming Summit for Democracy in March will be co-hosted by the US and the Netherlands, as well as Costa Rica, South Korea and Zambia.
is 55 years old. He has been PM of the Netherlands since 2010 and is the longest serving PM in Dutch history. He began his 4th term as PM in January 2022.
He has been the leader of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) since 2006.
Prior to becoming party leader he held several Cabinet positions from 2002-2006.
He was first elected as a Member of Parliament in 2003.
Before entering politics, he worked for Unilever.
POTUS started by telling the PM that he was welcome at the WH despite the WC game (The Dutch beat the Americans 3-1 in the round of 16)
PM Rutte pointed out that it was the first time the fireplace was on for a bilat in the oval (he also met with Barack Obama and Donald Trump)
His remarks were essentially focused on Russia's war in Ukraine.
About Dnipro: "These are horrible pictures and I think it strengthens even more our resolve to stay with Ukraine. And I commend you personally and the US for your leadership I'm convinced that history will judge that in 2022 if United States would not have stepped up like you did then things would have been very different."
"We can never accept that Putin and Russia get away with it. So accountability, take him to court to make sure that all he has done (...) is crucial."
"Let's stay close together and hopefully things will move forward in a way that is acceptable to Ukraine."
