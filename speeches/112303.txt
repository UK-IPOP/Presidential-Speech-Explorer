"Today, President Obama will ask voters for a do-over on his campaign message that the private sector is 'doing fine.' But it's going to take more than a major economic speech to make Americans forget that President Obama has failed to deliver a major economic recovery. From Day One, Mitt Romney will help put Americans back to work and finally get our economy moving again." â€“Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 "President Obama will use a speech in Ohio today effectively to hit a reset button on his re-election campaign, following a stretch of bad economic news and messaging missteps that have shaken Democrats' confidence and caused some allies to sound the alarm. At a community college outside Cleveland, Obama will seek to frame the economic debate with presumptive GOP nominee Mitt Romney, casting the November election as a stark choice rather than a referendum on his record."

 "So far, President Barack Obama has not been able to convince most Americans that they are better off than they were four years ago. ... In an economic speech on Thursday that could set the tone for months of campaigning, Obama is not likely to unveil new ideas to boost the economy and create new jobs, according to Democrats familiar with the preparations for the address."

 "Nonetheless, the speech comes at a time when even allies of the president are increasingly voicing their concern about the direction of the campaign. Among their observations is the idea that Obama is spending too much time criticizing opponent Mitt Romney and too little time framing a larger vision for where he wants to take the country if granted a second term."

 "James Carville said Wednesday he is 'worried' that President Barack Obama's message about an improving economy could be turning off voters. 'I'm worried that when the White House or the campaign talks about the progress that's being made, people take that as a signal that they think that things are fine and people don't feel they ought to believe that,' the Democratic strategist said on ABC's 'Good Morning America.'"

 "According to Bob Shrum, a longtime Democratic consultant known for being chief strategist to John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign, a referendum on the president would not be good for the standard bearer of his party. 'I think we ought to just face reality here. [If] you just let this be a referendum, I don't think the president could win,' Shrum said Sunday on "Face the Nation." 'Because the truth of the matter is, he may have created over 4.3 million jobs, he may have saved General Motors, but the country is still not back to where it needs to be.'"

 "As some high-profile Democrats question the focus of his pitch for a second term, President Obama today stuck closely to his well-worn script, telling a group of 500 donors here that the economy is moving in the right direction and that his policies will accelerate the recovery."

 "The Great Recession shrank Americans' wealth so much that in 2010 median family net worth was no more than it had been in 1992 after adjusting for inflation, the Federal Reserve reported Monday. Median net worth declined from $126,400 in 2007 to $77,300 in 2010, a Fed survey of family finances found. The median marks the point where half had more and half had less."
