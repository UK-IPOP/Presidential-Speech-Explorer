Since taking office, President Obama and this Administration have been guided by the knowledge that countries are more peaceful and prosperous when women are accorded full and equal rights and opportunity.

Building on this recognition and the ongoing work of America's diplomats, development experts, and military, today President Obama released the first-ever

chart a roadmap for how the United States will accelerate and institutionalize efforts across the government to advance women's participation in preventing conflict and keeping peace. The documents represent a fundamental change in how the U.S. will approach its diplomatic, military, and development-based support to women in areas of conflict, by ensuring that their perspectives and considerations of gender are woven into the fabric of how the United States approaches peace processes, conflict prevention, the protection of civilians, and humanitarian assistance.

•      
: The United States Government will strengthen its efforts to prevent – and protect women and children from – harm, exploitation, discrimination, and abuse, including sexual and gender-based violence and trafficking in persons, and to hold perpetrators accountable in conflict-affected environments.

•      
: The United States Government will promote women's roles in conflict prevention, improve conflict early-warning and response systems through the integration of gender perspectives, and invest in women and girls' health, education, and economic opportunity to create conditions for stable societies and lasting peace.

As directed by the Executive Order, the Departments of State and Defense, and USAID will designate officers to ensure implementation, and will submit to the National Security Advisor agency-specific plans establishing time-bound, measurable, resourced actions. These plans will be coordinated by a standing interagency committee chaired by the White House National Security Staff. This committee will:

•      Monitor and evaluate actions taken in support of national objectives through the creation of specific indicators;

•      Integrate the concepts behind Women, Peace, and Security into relevant national-level policies and strategies;

•      Establish a mechanism for regular consultation with civil society representatives;

•      Report annually to the National Security Council Deputies Committee on progress made toward achieving commitments, in order to inform a report to the President; and
