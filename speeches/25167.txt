SECRETARY of Labor Wirtz has reported to me on the progress of the first Neighborhood Youth Corps project in the Nation, which has been in operation since January in Newark, N.J.
In its initial month, the project has encouraged and heartened all of those associated with it. The 348 boys and girls now enrolled were out of school and out of work. They are now working, performing valuable social services in the city government. Over 180 have enrolled at night school. The project directors have reported a unanimous expression of new confidence and of new determination on the part of the enrollees.
There can be no more personal pain or more bitter feeling than the shock that comes to a young child when he first realizes that all of his dreams and ambitions are someone else's property.
The program in Newark, like the other NYC projects now opening across the country, not only conditions an untried skill for employment but restores a forlorn hope. Not only the opportunity for work but the basis for self-respect is being provided.
The war against poverty is, in the last analysis, the struggle for human decency and independence. This report is an early indication that we can succeed in this best of all efforts.
