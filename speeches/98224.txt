ARLINGTON, VA -- Today, McCain-Palin 2008 released its latest television ad, entitled "Advice." The ad highlights who Barack Obama is seeking advice from on mortgage and housing policy. Unfortunately for the American people, one of those advisers is Franklin Raines who led Fannie Mae when "extensive financial fraud" was committed to enrich Fannie executives. The ad will be televised nationally.
