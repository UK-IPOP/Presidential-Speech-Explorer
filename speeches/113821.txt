"President Obama may not want to talk about his second-term agenda, but he's already laid out his plans for the next four years. The President has promised trillions of dollars in new debt, higher taxes on middle-class families, and devastating cuts to Medicare that will impact today's seniors. Americans simply can't afford four more years like the last four years. As president, Mitt Romney will deliver a real recovery by reforming our outdated tax code, creating 12 million new jobs, and strengthening Medicare for the next generation." — Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson

 QUESTION: "Can I ask just maybe -- the President always says or likes to say we've created 4.5 million jobs. Given his fascination with that number, can we get any expectation from him of what he thinks we'll be able to create in the next four years?" ... CARNEY: "What the President does is focus on his policy proposals. And what you saw with the American Jobs Act is that rather than make predictions of -- like you're seeing from Governor Romney of 'my one-sheet plan here will create 12 million jobs' -- the President put forward a comprehensive job creation proposal, legislation that went before Congress, and we made no assessments of how many jobs it would create."

 "And even if Obama were to get his way on all fronts, the outlook remains grim. The federal debt held by the public would still nearly double again from $10.1 trillion at the end of 2011 to $18.8 trillion at the end of 2022. For the current fiscal year ending Sept. 30, CBO is now projecting a shortfall of $1.3 trillion. In fiscal 2013, the deficit will still hover near the $1 trillion mark — about $977 billion.

 "In a new paper, AEI's Matt Jensen looks at the real annual cost of servicing the debt for households at various levels of income — including a potentially higher tax burden. As the table below illustrates, a household making between $100,000 and $200,000 a year could find its tax liability higher by roughly $2,400 every year. Over ten years, that works out to $24,000. And when you add in the debt already accrued the past four years under President Obama (the second table), that's another $1,600 a year. So now we are now talking about $4,000 a year, $40,000 over ten years." (James Pethokoukis, "Study: Obama's Big Budget Deficits Could Mean A $4,000 A Year Middle-Class Tax Hike,"

 "In addition to flagging provider cuts as potentially unsustainable, the report [HHS] projected that reductions in payments to private Medicare Advantage plans would trigger an exodus from the popular alternative. Enrollment would plummet by about 50 percent. Seniors leaving the private plans would still have health insurance under traditional Medicare, but many might face higher out-of-pocket costs."

 "In the Office of the Actuary's April 22, 2010 memorandum on the estimated financial effects of the Affordable Care Act, we noted that by 2019 the update reductions would result in negative total facility margins for about 15 percent of hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and home health agencies. This estimated percentage would continue to increase, reaching roughly 25 percent in 2030 and 40 percent by 2050. In practice, providers could not sustain continuing negative margins and, absent legislative changes, would have to withdraw from providing services to Medicare beneficiaries, merge with other provider groups, or shift substantial portions of Medicare costs to their non-Medicare, non-Medicaid payers." ("Projected Expenditures Under An Illustrative Scenario With Alternative Payment Updates To Medicare Providers," Center For Medicare & Medicaid Services, 5/13/11)
