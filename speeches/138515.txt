We are ensnared in Donald Trump's failures. Every direction you look, the Trump Administration has failed to prepare, failed to act, failed to lead, and failed to care. Nowhere is that more evident than the colossal fiasco of testing. For months, the Trump Administration's refusal to ramp up a nationwide testing campaign and drive advances in faster, more affordable, more accurate testing -- as Joe Biden has 
 -- has enabled the virus to spread out of control through our communities. While the numbers of tests have increased, so have the infection rates and wait times - and experts say we are still not testing nearly enough. Testing sites are hard to access, and lines are long. The criteria for who needs a test is still unclear. And supply-chain bottlenecks mean some Americans are waiting a week or more for results, effectively rendering the test useless.

Trump's track record on testing has been abysmal. At every turn, he's lied. He's broken promises. He's taken steps to actually make things worse.
