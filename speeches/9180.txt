Lakewood, N.J., Nov. 22, 1916.
The President,
The White House, Washington, D.C.
Because of the closeness of the vote I have awaited the official count in California and now that it has been virtually completed, permit me to extend to you my congratulations upon your reelection. I desire also to express my best wishes for a most successful administration.
CHARLES E. HUGHES
