I EXTEND to the Organization of African Unity the greetings of the Government and the people of the United States of America.
We in the United States share with you a common aspiration for the advancement of human dignity and freedom. Your organization provides one means for the peoples of Africa to realize their hopes and dreams. Your past work in the peaceful settlement of disputes has demonstrated to all the world the great benefits to be derived from cooperative action.
I wish you success in your deliberations. It is our hope that they will strengthen the bonds among you and further advance the well-being of your member countries.
