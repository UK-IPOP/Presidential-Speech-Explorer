"…[N]ow is the time to move a comprehensive bill that enforces our borders and has good workplace enforcement; that doesn't grant automatic citizenship; that addresses this problem in a comprehensive way. I would hope that the Senate Majority Leader has that same sense of desire to move … the bill that I do and these senators do, because now is the time to get it done. … I believe without the bill it's going to be harder to enforce the border. The status quo is unacceptable."
 The current immigration system is broken:
 
 
 Today, we have an entire underground industry dedicated to producing fake IDs and fraudulent Social Security numbers.If this bill is not passed, the problems of the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act would persist – employers would continue operating under a system in which they have only a limited ability to tell whether documentation is authentic.
 
 If the bill is not passed, these workers would remain in the shadows of our society, where they are often exploited, underpaid, and afraid to go to the police for fear of deportation.
 
 Currently, applicants wait up to 30 years for green cards. In addition, our immigration system places far too little emphasis on the skills and attributes necessary to fill the needs of our growing economy and further the national interest.
