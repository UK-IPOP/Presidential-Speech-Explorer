Dear Dr. Peel:
I appreciate most highly receiving the latest census reports which show so graphically the wonderful economic conditions of the United States.
These figures confirm the facts, obvious to most of us, that the American people are today better off than ever before in our history. I am deeply satisfied to know just how great has been our amazing progress during the last ten years.

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN

[Honorable Roy V. Peel, Director, Bureau of the Census, Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C.]
