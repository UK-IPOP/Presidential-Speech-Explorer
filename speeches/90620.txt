 At a minimum, success means not leaving behind a safe haven in Iraq and Afghanistan for Al Qaeda or other terrorist groups, from which they can finance, train and launch devastating attacks on America, Israel, and the world. In Iraq, the Surge's success has been vital to ensuring that Al Qaeda is denied a safe haven from which to launch attacks.
 The Iranian regime denies the Holocaust, threatens Israel with destruction, funds terrorists targeting Americans and Israelis, commits flagrant human rights abuses and rushes toward nuclear weapons capabilities. The world must act now to stop the Iranian regime and their deadly actions.

, Governor Romney outlined a plan that will tighten economic sanctions against the Iranian regime; isolate Iran diplomatically and indict Iran's President Ahmadinejad for inciting genocide; enlist Arab states to join our efforts; make clear to the Iranian people the peril of acquiring nuclear capabilities; and maintain the military option.
- 
 Governor Romney is committed to the integrity of Israel as a Jewish nation. He makes this guarantee because Israel is a key strategic ally in the global war against radical Jihadists, because of our respect for the Israeli people, and because the world has a moral obligation to this nation.
 While there is a threat of nuclear material from nations like Iran falling into the hands of terrorists, we must be vigilant in preventing terrorists and Jihadists from acquiring what are commonly known as "loose nukes." 
, Governor Romney proposed a comprehensive strategy to guard against this nuclear peril by:
 
, Governor Romney outlined a strategy to defeat radical jihad around the world by:
- 
. Governor Romney will add at least 100,000 more troops to our Armed Forces and commit at least 4% of our gross domestic product to defense. We need to make long overdue investments in equipment, armament, weapon systems, and strategic defense.
- 
. Energy independence is vital to our national defense and our economic security. Governor Romney has called for a bold and far-reaching research initiative to create new, economic sources of clean energy. We must invest in renewable and alternative fuels such as ethanol, cellulosic ethanol, biodiesel, and liquefied coal. American resolve and investment are essential for energy security and national security.
- 
. Building on the Goldwater-Nichols military reforms of the 1980s, we need bold new reforms to ensure that our civilian and inter-agency instruments of national power have the ability to build joint efforts. For example, just as the different military branches have divided the world into regions with a single commander for each, our civilian agencies should be united under a single Presidential envoy or Deputy for each region of the world. These Deputies will have clear lines of authority, budgets and responsibility to develop and execute regional plans and strategies.
- 
. 
, Governor Romney called for expanding NATO by making it a global alliance and expanding its mission to defeat radical Islam. Governor Romney proposes building regional alliances linked to a global NATO in areas like the Middle East, Latin America and Africa. These regional alliances will provide personnel with localized knowledge and cultural awareness to address emerging crises and threats.
- 
 The Global Network Against Terror and Transnational Threats will link intelligence and law enforcement capabilities around the world to share data about border crossings, biometric indicators, passport fraud, nuclear and biological threats, criminal patterns, human trafficking and drug trafficking.
- 
 Building effective alliances means speaking clearly when institutions fail. The United Nations has failed to contain aggression, stop proliferation, and prevent genocide. America should not withdraw from the U.N. but we need a body where the free world can act. However, the U.N. Human Rights Council has a particularly repugnant record â€“ repeatedly targeting Israel while remaining silent in the face of the world's worst human rights abusers. The U.S. should withdraw immediately from the U.N. Human Rights Council.
