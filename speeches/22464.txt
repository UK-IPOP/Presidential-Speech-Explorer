I AM very pleased to send my greetings to the first annual conference of the Catholic Inter-American Cooperation Program.
Your deep and urgent concern with the acute social and economic problems of our Latin American neighbors is shown by the attendance of distinguished clergy and laymen from both North America and Latin America, and will, I know, be reflected in your discussions.
In your search for solutions to these problems-and in the action which stems from that search--you are proceeding along the path charted by Pope John XXIII--a path which the Church continues to follow under Pope Paul VI. The bold and imaginative actions taken by Church leaders in many Latin American countries in recent years have helped to give momentum to the twin goals of economic development and social justice to which our countries are pledged under the Alliance for Progress.
The policies underlying the Alliance have their root and inspiration in the great tradition of Judaeo-Christian ethics which we share with the other republics of the hemisphere. In steadfast adherence to these policies lies the best hope for the preservation of the spiritual values that give meaning to our lives.
Best wishes for the success of your conference.
