THESE SIX remarkable men are modern pioneers. We live today in a world of such rapid change in science, international affairs, and socio-economic patterns that traditional, inherited knowledge is no longer sufficient to solve urgent problems. We must seek new answers from people who have sought and mastered new knowledge, from people unafraid to voice constructive discontent with tried but no longer true methods, from people with the energy and the initiative to break through the long-accepted boundaries of action. Such are the six selected for this high civilian honor, and we are both fortunate and proud to have them in our Nation's public service.
We are fortunate and proud, also, to have in the Federal Government the kind of civilian career service that can attract persons of such outstanding excellence and afford scope and opportunity for the exercise of their superlative talents. In honoring these men we recognize anew the extraordinary qualifies of skill, energy, and dedication that are to be found in the career ranks of the Federal service.
