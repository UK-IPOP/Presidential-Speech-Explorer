 How's it going? What are you guys doing in my yard? [
] When did you guys show up here? [
] You just came an hour ago? How's it going? Who are you? Your name's Cathy?
 Hi, Obama.
 Hey, you.
So what's been going on? What have you guys been up to?
 Singing camp songs!
 Rock climbing!
 You're singing camp songs?
 Yes!
 I don't——
 Is that all you've been doing is singing? And why are you all dusty? [
] What game were you all playing? [
]
 So you've been singing, but what were you doing before you were singing?
 Eating dinner.
 Rock climbing.
 You guys had dinner. I'll bet it was delicious.
 Yes.
 You did some rock climbing?
 Yes!
 Where did you go rock climbing? [
] There are no rocks over there. What are you talking about? [
]
 I made it to the top twice.
 Did you? Twice?
. I saw it. I was there.
. You saw it? You can vouch for it? So you guys been having fun?
 Yes!
 So the—most of you guys are going into fifth grade or sixth grade?
 Fifth.
 Going into fifth. The—and so you guys are from a bunch of different troops, or—— 
 Yes.
 Okay, from all over the country?
 Yes.
 Wow. So you guys are making new friends.
 Yes.
 Well, that's so much—that's terrific.
 Look at their cool little chairs.
 They're very nice chairs.
 They roll back. [
] Do we get to bring them home?
 Can I just say that, like, when I went camping, my tents weren't as nice. [
] And I didn't have cool chairs like this. [
] So you guys——
 Are these your chairs?
 Huh?
 Are these your chairs?
 No.
 [
]
 I don't know.
 Did we give you these chairs?
 They just showed up. [
] I don't know what you guys are doing here. [
]
 We're camping on your lawn. [
]
 You're camping on my lawn. I don't know how that happened.
 We're making history.
 She says, "We're making history."
 You're making history. Well, actually, I think the reason that you guys are here is because we're celebrating the great outdoors
 Yes.
. And the National Park Service is trying to make sure that young people "get outside, so you guys aren't watching TV all the time or playing video games all the time, but you're getting outside, getting some fresh air, and spending time with your friends and having adventures. And there are national parks all across the country, and it turns out that the White House is a national park.
 Yes!
 Who knew? I didn't know that. Did I know that? I did?
 They knew.
 You guys knew. 
 Yes.
 Okay. So you guys are helping to celebrate and kick off this whole Great Outdoors adventure that everybody is having—going to be having this summer, right?
 Yes!
 All right. So I don't really know any campfire songs. Are you guys going to teach me one?
 Yes!
 Cathy, do you have a song?
[
]
 Fantastic. That was outstanding. There's real talent here. You guys sounded pretty good. Had you practiced before?
 No.
 We could go on "America's Got Talent."
 You could go on "America's Got Talent." No doubt about it. What's next?
[
 
]
 You are all sisters. You're our sister too, Mr. President.
 I'm a brother. I'm a brother.
 You're a brother.
 Hold on a second. Time out. I'm a brother.
 Yes, but you're very in touch with your feminine side.
 Yes. Clearly.
 That's what makes you so wonderful.
[
]
 Yay! That was outstanding. Did you guys see the First Lady? Did you see the First Lady rocking out a little bit? [
] She had some moves. Yes!
All right, well, this is a—you know what, you guys are having so much fun. Unfortunately, I've got to go to work.
 No!
 I am not allowed to have fun. [
]
 Can we have a hug?
 Can we hug?
 We can have a group hug.
[
]
 Those are some good hugs! I didn't know that Girl Scouts gave such good hugs. [
] Who are those Girl Scouts over there? [
]
 They look at least like they're juniors. [
]
Well, it's good to see you guys. I'm so glad you guys are having fun. All right? But I want to make sure—you guys better clean up this mess. [
] When I come—when I wake up in the morning——
 They're—they'll still be here.
 I'm teasing. You guys will still be here. I'm teasing, I'm teasing. But you guys aren't going to be making a racket, are you?
 No!
 Yes!
 Did I hear a yes?
