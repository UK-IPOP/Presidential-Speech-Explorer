, 
Hello from Nantucket, I'll be your pooler today.
The pool has been swept and is now holding in a bus near the residence where the president is staying.
POTUS and FLOTUS are returning to the White House this afternoon, please see the daily guidance below.
Feel free to reach out if needed.
 
The pool joined the president's motorcade at 2:15 pm and we are now rolling.
The motorcade reached Nantucket's airport at 2:22 pm after an uneventful drive.
Small groups of people were waving and taking pictures as we drove by.
The president boarded at 2:24 pm shortly after the First Lady.
He waved and saluted at the top of the stairs.
He did not stop to take questions.
We will be wheels up shortly
