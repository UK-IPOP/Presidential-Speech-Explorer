OF THOSE who stand for a time in places of power, many are quickly forgotten. It is a measure of Dean Acheson's stature as man and statesman that almost 20 years after his service as Secretary of State, he continued to be recognized as one of the towering figures of his time. He was a man not only of great achievement but also of rare intellect, of rigorous conscience, and of profound devotion to his country. As President, I have been deeply appreciative of the advice that I have asked, and that he has so freely and graciously given. I shall greatly miss both his wise counsel and his penetrating wit.
The Nation, the Western Alliance, and the world all share in the loss of one of their staunchest champions.
