 codfish constitutes one of the basic staples in the diet of the low-income groups in Puerto Rico; and
 the supply of codfish in Puerto Rico, practically all of which is imported from Canada, Newfoundland, and Labrador, will probably be substantially reduced as a result of the war; and
 it is imperative that a substitute low-cost food be made available; and
 jerked beef is a satisfactory substitute for codfish; and
 section 318 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (46 Stat. 590, 696) provides, in part as follows:
"Whenever the President shall by proclamation declare an emergency to exist by reason of a state of war, or otherwise, he may authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to extend during the continuance of such emergency the time herein prescribed for the performance of any act, and may authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to permit, under such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe, the importation free of duty of food, clothing, and medical, surgical, and other supplies for use in emergency relief work.":
 President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the above-quoted statutory provisions, do hereby declare an emergency to exist by reason of the present war, and do hereby authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to permit, until it shall be determined by the President and declared by his Proclamation that the emergency has terminated, under such regulations and subject to such conditions as he may deem necessary, the importation of jerked beef free of duty when imported by or directly for the account of any public agency or any relief organization, not operated for profit, for distribution to consumers in Puerto Rico, or by or directly for the account of any dealer in foodstuffs for sale or distribution to consumers in that area.
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 1st day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-sixth.
