Folks, let's do it again. Good morning from Madrid, where the pool has gathered ahead of a long day at NATO. The first event on POTUS' schedule will be greetings with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and then, moments later, Pedro Sánchez, prime minister of the host country of Spain.
The day's full schedule is below. And because of some quick movements, you'll also get reports from my co-pooler Eli Stokols of the Los Angeles Times. They probably won't be as good. Be in touch if you have any questions.
¡Vamanos!

The presidential motorcade pulled away from the POTUS hotel RON at 9:54, heading for IFEMA, a Madrid convention center that is hosting many of the NATO events this week.
The POTUS motorcade arrived at the summit site at 10:11 am after an uneventful drive through Madrid's sunbathed streets. Plenty of onlookers snapping photos of the passing vehicles.
Five minutes later, POTUS was greeted by NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg. They shook hands and took seats inside a small side room.
POTUS deemed it one of the most important and "historic" NATO summits ever and said that the alliance was committed to "defending every inch" of its territory. He praised the steps of Finland and Sweden to enter the alliance, saying "NATO is more needed now than it ever has been."
As previewed yesterday, Biden unveiled an enhanced US force posture in Europe, and committed to increasing the number of troops stationed here from its current levels. Among the nations singled out by POTUS that would receive additional troops and/or resources: Spain, Poland, Romania, the Baltic states. Confirming Putin's aggression, POTUS said that NATO would be "ready for threats in all directions"
Stoltenberg said to Biden that the increased US presence "Demonstrates your decisive leadership" and that Finland and Sweden's entry shows that NATO's "door is open." He added that Putin wanted "less NATO" but is getting "more NATO."
Pool was pulled from the room at 10:23
Leaders gathered for North Atlantic Council Session 1 in a larger, partitioned-off section of the convention center. POTUS entered at 10:56 and worked his way across the room. Pool spotted him greeting Canada's Justin Trudeau, the UK's Boris Johnson, as well as the chairman of NATO's military committee, among others.
POTUS then posed for a photo with Stoltenberg and Turkey's Erdogan before taking his seat. He is seated between Stoltenberg and Johnson. Sitting behind Biden are SecState Blinken and SecDef Austin.
Stoltenberg called the meeting to order at 11:01. He immediately called out Russia and China for defying the world's "rules-based order." He vowed to continue the support Ukraine and touted the applications for entry by Finland and Sweden, which prompted some applause from the leaders gathered in the room.
Next up: Prime Minister Sánchez of Spain. He welcomed the leaders to Madrid and singled out Turkey for coming to an agreement that would admit Finland and Sweden. He added: "The world is looking at us, let us show them our unity"
Stoltenberg then thanked the media, who were escorted out of the room at 11:06. Pool will not have a lengthy hold as the meeting continues.

POTUS held a trilateral meeting with President Yoon Suk-Yeol of the Republic of Korea and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan. The setting: one of those generic bilats rooms carved out of the cavernous convention center. Lots of pushing and shoving on the way in as all three nations' press corps jockeyed for position
Pool was brought in at 2:37 pm. Biden opened by thanking both of his fellow leaders, declaring that "trilateral cooperation is essential" on regional issues, namely North Korea and its missile tests.
Biden said he was pleased that this meeting was being held on the margins of NATO, and he praised both Korea and Japan for their efforts to combat Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. He spoke for less than two minutes. The US delegation included SecState Blinken, SecState Austin and National Security Adviser Sullivan.
The other two leaders also spoke briefly, focusing mostly on the threat posed by North Korea. Pool was pulled from the room at 2:42. The leaders did not take questions but Biden joked that it would be "interesting" to watch the combative press corps leave the room. He then suggested "Don't get hurt."

A trio of senior administration officials approached the pool at 3:06 pm and briefed us in the hold for about 25 minutes. It was conducted on background. No real news, a few toplines:
The new NATO strategic concept will be released shortly and focuses heavily on Russia. But it also, for the first time, mentions China. The document will note that China's stated ambitions and challenge the alliance's interests, security and values, and that NATO will respond by raising its own defenses and resilience. A growing area of concern: the increasing ties between China and Russia.
Confirmed that Zelenskyy spoke the allies earlier but left it for the Ukrainians to read out what he said. But officials said NATO's commitment to Ukraine was firm and did not show signs of wavering even with growing belief that the war could stretch for months and potentially well into 2023. Said brief discussions were held about the food and energy insecurity stemming from the war.
Reiterates that the US did not offer Turkey anything to get Erdogan to drop his objections to allowing Sweden and Finland into the alliance (but note the warm US remarks about F-16s earlier today). Did not have specific details on the timeline of the process that would officially allow the two nations to join NATO but believed it would happen fairly quickly.
The officials underscored some of what we heard from POTUS this morning when he announced the new force posture but did not have specific details on troop numbers. They also repeated the themes we have heard all week about the administration's commitment to these alliances and how it will steadfastly support Ukraine during this invasion.
The officials did not suggest that Biden's agenda for the summit would change after he now does not have to spend time, as had been expected, trying to help gain Turkey's approval for Finland and Sweden's admittance. And said that foreign leaders had not raised U.S. internal issues with Biden, saying all leaders have their own domestic politics with which to deal.
POTUS is meeting with President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey. Pool assembled outside the same small bilat room we were in before. We entered at 5:54 with surprisingly little pushing and shoving.
Biden opened by saying "it was good to see" his Turkish counterpart. He cited Erdogan's work to address the food insecurity stemming from the war in Ukraine as well as the deal he struck to allow Finland and Sweden to join NATO. POTUS said: "You're doing a great job, I just want to thank you."
POTUS also thanked Erdogan for "all the incredible work you are doing" trying to get grain out of Ukraine.
Erdogan responded that he thinks after the summit both leaders "will be able to go back to our countries with full satisfaction." He praised Biden for leading NATO since the war began: "Your pioneering in this regard is going to be crucial in strengthening NATO for the future." And he added that overcoming the grain blockade "require all of us to work together"
Pool was pulled from the room at 5:58. POTUS ignored shouted questions about F-16s.
The room is blue, the two delegations line the walls. Four flags, two from each nation, provided the backdrop for Biden and Erdogan. The US delegation included SecState Blinken, SecDef Austin, NSA Sullivan. From WH:

The presidential motorcade pulled away from the convention center hosting the summit at 6:58 pm.
The motorcade wound its way through the city's streets, at one point passing Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, the legendary home of the Real Madrid futbol team. Plenty of onlookers checking out the motorcade as well. We arrived at 7:18 pm
Pool is now holding as well expect POTUS to soon leave for the TransAtlantic Dinner hosted by the prime minister of Spain.
The motorcade is rolling again, departing POTUS hotel RON at 7:48 pm
Lots of onlookers watching the motorcade on its short journey to Museo Nacional del Prado, the site of tonight's leaders' dinner. It is considered one of the world's most spectacular art museums but pool will not enjoy its splendors, for we are holding at a separate location nearby.
The presidential limousine turned into the museum grounds at 7:52 pm

Morning from Madrid — I'm tagging in as co-pooler for the greeting between POTUS, Jens Stoltenberg and Spanish President Pedro Sánchez and family photo with allied heads of state and government.
It was typically uneventful, but if you're into details, here you go…
At 10:27 a.m., a restricted pool entered a cavernous blue-carpeted area inside of a round arena-like space with a long stage across from a crowded press riser. The blue wall behind the stage featured the summit logo. Off to one side, hundreds of summit attendees milled about and watched.
At 10:32, Stoltenberg and Sánchez were announced and walked onto the stage and stood a few feet apart beneath the logo. Leader introductions began a minute later with the prime minister of Slovenia out first, followed by Germany Chancellor Olaf Scholz.
Each leader shook the two hosts' hands, then stood in between them for a moment as shutters clicked here on the riser. Some, like Canadian PM Justin Trudeau and Belgian PM Alexander De Croo, gave Stoltenberg a fuller embrace: bit of a hug and hearty pat on the back. British PM Boris Johnson, for those interested, wore a blue tie that was characteristically askew. Easily the most furious shutter-clicking on the riser occurred when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan walked across the stage at 10:45, followed by French President Emmanuel Macron.
Then there was a short pause, as all the leaders had been announced but one, who was then seen walking with aides through the crowd beside the stage. Stoltenberg and Sánchez neared one another and made small talk on stage for a moment while the final leader made his way behind the stage.
POTUS then strode onto the stage at 10:48 as the announcer said: "The honorable Joe Biden, President of the United States of America." He shook Stoltenberg's hand, then turned and smiled at the cameras. Then he shook Sánchez's hand and gathered the men closer to him for a short chat before moving off stage.
At 10:52, the leaders began to walk back on the stage starting with the group arrayed on the top step first, then the middle step group (Macron and Scholz in the middle); then the bottom step (front row) with Sánchez, Stoltenberg, POTUS and Johnson in the center, and Erdogan next to Trudeau.
After a path was cleared through the crowd, the leaders stepped off the riser and headed out of the room at 10:45.
Heading back to rejoin the full pool.
At 3:14 p.m., your supplemental pooler entered the same large, partitioned, blue-curtained and well-illuminated room where the leaders met earlier. Staffers were still scurrying about placing water bottles and bowls (of nuts? candies?) at each of the leader's desks, all arranged in a massive circle. Behind each leader are three rows of desks for aides.
The leaders began trickling about 15 minutes later. POTUS entered the room at 3:44 after it was mostly full and through a different door than the other leaders used, one that was on the far side of the room from our riser but much closer to his seat. He shook hands with NATO Secretary Genera Jens Stoltenberg and then sat down.
The North Atlantic Council Session 2 meeting got underway at 3:46 as Stoltenberg banged the gavel and numerous conversations broke up as leaders hustled to their seats.
POTUS sat between Stoltenberg and British PM Boris Johnson, who had Erdogan and Sánchez to his right.
Stoltenberg welcomed the leaders of Finland, Sweden and other non-NATO members, including "info-Pacific partners" at the summit "for the first time."
He said NATO's new strategic concept "reflects a new security reality" because of Russia's aggression, as well as other threats, and "recognizes the challenges we all face are truly global."
He also singled out China: "China does not share our values and like Russia it seeks to undermine the international rules-based order."
Finally, he cited the agreement yesterday between Turkey and Finland and Sweden, praising the two countries that will be next to join NATO.
"You make your countries safer and our alliance stronger," Stoltenberg said before thanking the press, which is when we were asked to leave the room.
POTUS did not speak while we were in the room, nor did any of the other leaders.
Pool escorted out at 3:49, heading back to the hold.
