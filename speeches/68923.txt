The Administration supports passage of H.R. 1702 
:
The amendments necessary to accomplish these objectives have been provided to the House Science Committee by the Administration.
H.R. 1702 would affect direct spending and receipts; therefore it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. This Office's preliminary estimate is that the net impact of H.R. 1702 on the deficit would be less than $500,000 per year.
