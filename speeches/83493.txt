President Bush welcomes the 9/11 Commission report and agrees with its conclusion that our Homeland is safer today, but we are not yet safe. He has ordered the highest levels of government to examine in short order the Commission's recommendations and to use them to develop a plan for further action.
The Commission carefully and thoughtfully studied the many complex and critical issues facing our Nation in the War on Terror – and we are gratified that the Commission's final report comes to conclusions similar to the Administration's on the vast majority of the key policy issues.
As the Commission recommended:
These are important steps along the road the Commission charts for intelligence reform. More steps are needed – and more will be taken – but a solid foundation for future action is in place. The Commission's intelligence-reform proposals build on this foundation. The reform efforts we take now will establish an intelligence structure to protect America for decades to come, and it is important to get it right, which is why the Administration is actively and seriously examining each of the Commission's recommendations.
The following are examples of actions already taken by the Bush Administration that are fulfilling the 9/11 Commission's recommendations.
