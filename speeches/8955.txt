THE WHITE HOUSE, 
TO THE SENATE:
Responsive to Senate Resolution No. 237, asking for records, minutes, arguments, debates, conversations, etc., relating to the so-called Four-Power Treaty, I have to advise that it is impossible to comply with the Senate's request. Many of the things asked for in the resolution it is literally impossible to furnish, because there were many conversations and discussions quite outside the conference, yet vital to its success. Naturally these are without record.
I do not believe it to be compatible with public interest or consistent with the amenities of international negotiation to attempt to reveal informal and confidential conversations or discussions, of which no record was kept, or to submit tentative suggestions or informal proposals, without which the arrival at desirable international understandings would be rendered unlikely if not impossible.
While I am unable to transmit the information requested, I do, however, take this opportunity to say most emphatically that there were no concealed understandings, and no secret exchanges of notes, and there are no commitments whatever except as appear in the Four-Power Treaty itself and the supplementary agreement, which are now in the hands of the Senate.
Respectfully,
WARREN G. HARDING
