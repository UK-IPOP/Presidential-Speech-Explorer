I AM very much 'pleased to have you here today. I hope we can accomplish the purposes set forth in the message in the proposed bill that is now before the two committees in the House and the Senate, and continue to help those refugees who certainly deserve our help and support.
It is a pleasure to me to welcome you here at the White House today.
