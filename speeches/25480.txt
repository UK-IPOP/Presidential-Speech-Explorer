I AM most pleased and gratified by the preliminary report I have received today from Dr. Colin MacLeod on the recent meetings in Tokyo to explore the joint U.S.-Japan undertaking to improve the health of the peoples of Asia.
I am especially grateful for the courtesies extended to our representatives and particularly for Prime Minister Sato's personal interest in meeting with Dr. MacLeod.
The peoples of Asia have endured for centuries the oppression of many diseases and illnesses. Today the stifling effects of ill health stand in the way of fulfillment for the progress toward a better life which we of the United States so much want the peoples of Asia to enjoy. In Japan as in the United States progress has been made for developing medical science and research which are bringing rising standards of health to the peoples of both lands. It is my hope--as I expressed to Prime Minister Sato during his visit to Washington in January--that we might pool our knowledge, talents, and resources to mount more successful attacks upon the diseases afflicting the lives of the people who live around the rim of the Pacific.
On the basis of the talks in Tokyo, I am confident that this joint effort will move forward effectively and successfully and will make a contribution of historic dimensions to the health of Asia. We are honored and privileged to be associated with Japan in this important humane endeavor.
