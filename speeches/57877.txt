The purpose of this Statement of Administration Policy is to express the Administration's views on H.R. 5504, the FY 1993 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill, as reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee.



The Administration opposes the abortion-related language in the Committee bill. This language would permit abortions to be performed at U.S. military facilities in cases other than when the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term. The President has stated that he would veto any legislation that would weaken current law or regulation with respect to abortion-related activities. Therefore, if this provision were to be included in the bill presented to the President, the President would veto the bill.

The Administration urges the Senate to restore the funding that was cut from the President's request. In addition, the Senate is urged to re-direct funding provided by the Committee for unrequested programs to those programs that are of critical importance to the objectives of our national security policy.





Based on a preliminary review, several provisions in the Committee bill may be appropriately classified as domestic discretionary, rather than defense discretionary, under the Budget Enforcement Act (BEA). OMB is reviewing the language of the Committee bill and report to determine the implications of these provisions with respect to their appropriate classification under the BEA.
