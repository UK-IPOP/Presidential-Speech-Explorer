 Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced his slate of Congressional District delegates for the West Virginia primary on May 13th. Romney for President West Virginia State Chairman and Member of the House of Delegates Bob Ashley said:
"The Romney Campaign has a strong slate of Congressional District delegates that will add to the at-large delegate slate we named in December. Governor Romney is committed to a strong showing at the West Virginia Presidential Convention and in the May 13th primary. With the state of the economy on the minds of many West Virginians, Governor Romney is the clear choice for Republicans looking for a candidate with real-world experience and a decades-long track record of creating real jobs for real people."
Governor Romney was the first Republican Presidential candidate to campaign in West Virginia, the first candidate to announce he will compete in the West Virginian Presidential Convention, and the first to file to do so, in August 2007.
