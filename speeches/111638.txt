"President Obama is trying to run on Bill Clinton's record because, after three and a half years in office, middle-class Americans aren't better off under his leadership. Jobs and incomes have declined, while the nation's debt and deficits are up. As inconvenient as it might be for President Obama, it's time for him to run on his own record, not the record he wished he had." — Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman

 "Yet real median household income in March was down $4,300 since Obama took office in January 2009 and down $2,900 since the June 2009 start of the economic recovery, according to an analysis of census data by Sentier Research, an economic- consulting firm in Annapolis, Maryland."

 "Applications for unemployment benefits stayed above a level last week that is generally considered too high to lower the unemployment rate. And the annual growth rate for the U.S. economy in the January-March quarter was unchanged at a tepid 1.9 percent. ... Growth of around 1.9 percent typically generates roughly 90,000 jobs a month. That's considered too weak to lower the unemployment rate, which was 8.2 percent last month." (Christopher S. Rugaber, "Tepid Economic Growth Weighs On US Job Market,"

"Clinton campaigned on the economy and had remarkable success. GDP growth during his eight years averaged 3.5% per year, second only to the combined Kennedy/Johnson years and ahead of Jimmy Carter and Reagan." (Dan Ackman, "Presidents And Prosperity,"
