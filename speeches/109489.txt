"After more than three years in office, all President Obama can offer voters are the same broken promises and empty rhetoric he's been using since 2008. Americans deserve a president who understands how to create jobs and cut spending, not someone who is only capable of making promises he just wouldn't keep." —Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 OBAMA: "I enjoyed science when I was young, and if I recall correctly, if an experiment fails badly, you know, you learn from that, right? Sometimes you can learn from failure. That's part of the data that teaches you stuff, that expands our knowledge, but you don't then just keep on doing the same thing over and over again. You go back to the drawing board. You try something different." (President Barack Obama, Remarks, Boca Raton, FL, 4/10/12)
 OBAMA: "I believe that we cannot stop investing in the things that helped create that middle class, that create real long lasting, broad based growth in this country. ... We should be expanding our investment in clean energy." (President Barack Obama, Remarks, Boca Raton, FL, 4/10/12)

 "Solar panel maker Solyndra received a $528 million Energy Department loan in 2009 — and went bankrupt last year. The government's risky investment strategy didn't stop there, as a CBS News investigation has uncovered a pattern of cases of the government pouring your tax dollars into clean energy."

 "The bonuses and bankruptcies come against a growing wave of trouble for companies financed with Energy Department dollars.

 "A report due to be released today by a Republican senator contends the Obama administration's stimulus program is fraught with waste and incompetence — evidenced by a turtle crossing in northern Florida that will cost more than $3 million and a snafu in which thousands of Social Security checks went out to people who had died."

 "Remember ‘shovel-ready projects.' Those were construction projects in the 2009 stimulus bill that were supposed to get moving right away ... ‘Shovel-ready was not as shovel-ready as we expected,' Obama said." (David Jackson, "Obama Jokes About 'Shovel-Ready Projects',"

 "GSA Administrator Martha Johnson admitted in a letter of resignation that her agency had made a ‘significant misstep' and that ‘taxpayer dollars were squandered.' A GSA Inspector General's report on the 2010 GSA "Western Regions" training conference in Las Vegas shows the government spent more than $822,000 for the 300 attendees, including $75,000 on team building exercises, $6,000 on commemorative coins and $6,000 on canteens, keychains and T-shirts."

 "The 2013 budget the president submitted today does not come close to meeting this promise of being reduced to $650 billion for fiscal year 2013. The president noted in that 2009 speech the Obama administration inherited a $1.3 trillion deficit. The deficit was similarly $1.3 trillion in 2011, is projected to be $1.15 trillion in 2012, and the president's budget claims it will be $901 billion in 2013."
