Dear President Hoover:
I warmly appreciate your telegram in respect to defense reorganization. As you indicate, in the interest of unity, efficiency and the greatest military strength at the least cost, the need is urgent to vest clear-cut authority in the Secretary of Defense. On this very issue serious differences have developed between proposals I have made and certain provisions of the bill now being debated in the House of Representatives. Your message powerfully supports the ,basic approach which I have been striving to advance, and I am most grateful to you for it.

With warm regard,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
