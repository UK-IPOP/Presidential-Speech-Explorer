Good morning. The pool met up with POTUS motorcade near the Biden residence. We began rolling toward an undisclosed location at 7:02.
As a reminder, today is the anniversary of the deaths of Biden’s first wife and baby daughter in a car crash in 1972. Last year he visited the church where they were buried.
We arrived at St. Joseph on the Brandywine Roman Catholic Church. Pool spotted Hunter Biden entering. We did not see POTUS. We’re holding on the sidewalk outside.
POTUS stepped out of church at 7:55. He clasped hands with the priest, who was wearing purple robes, outside the front door. The pool spotted baby Beau toddling down the path leading away from the church until his father Hunter scooped him up.
It’s overcast and chilly, and the ground is wet from early morning rain.
POTUS walked around the church and turned toward the part of the cemetery where his wife Neilia, daughter Naomi and son Beau are buried.
At that point the pool loaded back into the bus. We rejoined the motorcade and were rolling at 8:10.
According to the White House, POTUS and FLOTUS were joined at church by:
Hunter Biden
Melissa Cohen
Beau Biden
Naomi Biden
Peter Neal
Jack Owens
Ashley Biden
Howard Krein
Natalie Biden
Hunter Biden
Hallie Biden
We returned to the Biden residence at 8:17, and we were given a travel/photo lid. Have a good day.
Scratch that lid. No other details at this moment. Pool is still headed back to hotel.
We were given a travel/photo lid at 10:45.
