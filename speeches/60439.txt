The Administration supports the short-term extension of the EAA as proposed in H.R. 750.



H.R. 750 would affect receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate of this bill indicates that its enactment would decrease the deficit by less than $500,000 a year. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from this estimate.
