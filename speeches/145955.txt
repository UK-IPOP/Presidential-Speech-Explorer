Today, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced that the first $3 billion of investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will soon be disbursed to 3,075 airports across the country. The investments are expected to modernize airport infrastructure, improve experiences for travelers, strengthen safety, support good jobs, and make America's travel hubs more sustainable. As airports have struggled to rebound from the pandemic, they will have the autonomy to determine how to make these investments that support their economic growth.

"The Federal Aviation Administration announced Thursday how it will allocate the first $3 billion in new funds for airports from the infrastructure law, money that could spur upgrades in terminals and on the tarmac to help get passengers to planes more quickly and into the air on time."
"It's the first major new tranche of federal airport funding since the stimulus adopted after the financial crisis more than a decade ago. 
"
"'The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has given us a once-in-a-generation opportunity to build safer and more sustainable airports that connect individuals to jobs and communities to the world,' Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said. 
"
"'We will see a significant portion of this money go in some way to terminal projects,' said Annie Russo, the [Airports Council International-North America]'s senior vice president of government and political affairs. 'It will be incredibly helpful in jump-starting projects.'"
"… Russo said opening the door to spending on terminals is new for the federal government — and something airport leaders pushed to be included in the bill. For years, airports have relied on the Passenger Facility Charge, a ticket fee, to fund building projects."
