 Governor Romney's plan will allow the middle class in Iowa to save tax-free by changing the tax rate on interest, capital gains and dividends to absolutely 0%. By helping more Iowans save and invest, we can meet the challenges of an aging population and ensure the financial security of America.
 Any taxpayer with Adjusted Gross Income of under $200,000 would pay a tax rate of absolutely 0% on all of the income they earn from their savings, capital gains and dividends.
 Based on 2005 tax returns:
 Recent housing market difficulties offer an important reason for helping more people save and invest. As the market softens, credit has tightened. Therefore lending standards will become much tougher. As exotic loans become less widespread, the traditional practice of saving for a home down-payment will be the new standard. Governor Romney's plan will help Iowans save for down-payments and achieve the American dream of home ownership.
 By providing taxpayers with a 0% tax rate on savings, the plan will help homeowners meet their current mortgage payments. This tax cut will put more money into the hands of Iowa homeowners.
 In 2003, the United States passed major cuts in the tax rate on capital gains and dividends, instituting a new, lower top rate of 15%. These tax cuts galvanized our economy. Iowans were able to keep more of their capital gains and reinvest in the economy:


 Governor Romney will make the Bush tax relief permanent, cut tax rates for all Iowans, abolish the death tax, and make the corporate tax rate more competitive with the rest of the world.
