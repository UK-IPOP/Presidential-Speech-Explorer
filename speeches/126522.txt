Said Hansen, "I had the privilege of serving in Congress with John Kasich for 18 years. I know him to be a man of great integrity and a dynamic leader who truly puts people over politics. He's demonstrated the ability to solve seemingly unsolvable problems time and again, from leading the effort to balance the federal budget to turning the economy around in Ohio. I'm encouraged to see Utah voters respond positively to his message of results as Caucus Night approaches."
Hansen represented Utah's 1st Congressional DIstrict from 1981 to 2003, the last two years of which he chaired the House Committee on Natural Resources. After retiring from Congress, the Davis County resident served on the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission.
Said Kasich, "I'm grateful for the generous support of my friend and former colleague Jim Hansen, who I have long admired and respected for his deep commitment to improving the lives of his constituents through commonsense solutions. As we continue to expand our ground operation leading up to the Utah caucuses, I appreciate having his expertise and support on our side."
