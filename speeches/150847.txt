North American cooperation makes our countries safer, our economies more competitive, and our supply chains more resilient. By working together, the countries of North America are better able to address shared challenges, like climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, and transnational criminal organizations trafficking and smuggling people and illicit drugs like fentanyl. The North American Leaders' Summit (NALS) strengthens our partnerships and advances our shared priorities. Today, President Biden is joining President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada to promote a common vision for North America. This year, the leaders will build on last year's accomplishments with new initiatives and announcements.
