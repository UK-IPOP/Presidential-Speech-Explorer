 The COVID-19 pandemic laid bare critical shortcomings in our health care and health insurance systems, and the ARP shored up vital gaps by providing more affordable coverage to millions of American, including many who lost their jobs over the last two years. Today, the Biden Administration is announcing a state-by-state breakdown of health insurance enrollment changes during this year’s Open Enrollment Period (OEP).
 During the 2022 OEP,14.5 million Americans enrolled in a Marketplace plan through HealthCare.Gov or a State-Based Marketplace.
 The increase to 14.5 million people represented a 21% increase over 2021 due to the expansions of cost-saving subsidies in the American Rescue Plan.
 As a result of the American Rescue Plan (ARP), families were able to keep more money in their pockets, with actual savings of $67 per month per person in premiums – that’s more than $800 each year per person for groceries, child care, or other essentials.
according to data from HHS. Between 2016 and 2019, 3.6 million Americans lost coverage.
