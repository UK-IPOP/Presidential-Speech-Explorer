 – Following a tour of East Riverside Health Center today, Senator John Edwards detailed the cost-saving measures in the universal health care plan he laid out in February. Edwards' plan to guarantee quality, affordable health care to every person in America plan would save an average family $2,000 to $2,500 a year and eliminate at least $130 billion a year in wasteful health care spending.
"Americans today aren't getting the quality of health care they pay for and can't afford the cost of the care they do receive," said Edwards. "The American health care system today is broken—for families and businesses like those here in Detroit. These businesses and their unions made a promise to workers and now it's time for the government to hold up its end of the bargain and lower health care costs. To fix our health care crisis, we need a fundamental change —the plan I laid out in February will cover every man, woman and child in America and bring down costs for families and businesses."
In February, Edwards announced his plan for universal health care, which would ensure that families without insurance will get coverage at an affordable price, families with insurance will pay less and get more security and choice, and it will be cheaper and easier for businesses and employers to insure their workers.
Edwards' health care plan will make health care more affordable for families and cut costs in the health care system by creating an affordable and accountable health care system.
