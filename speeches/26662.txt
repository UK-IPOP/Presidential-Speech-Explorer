Mr. Prime Minister, Mrs. Eshkol, Mr. Secretary of State, my dear friends:
Shalom. The traditional greeting of Israel has very special meaning for all of us who have come here today.
We meet here in peace, and we will talk in peace.
And we will try to extend the peace that is in our hearts--extend it to all men who are willing to share our partnership of good faith and good purpose.
Mr. Prime Minister, we will be together for only 2 short days. But they will be long days full of friendship and full of happiness because you have come here to be with us.
These, too, will be hopeful days, because this land was born in that spirit--that spirit of promise and opportunity.
Here in this land our neighbors work hand in hand for the common good.
So, Mr. Prime Minister and Mrs. Eshkol, we extend to you this afternoon the hand of welcome to this land. We hope its spirit refreshes you after the long journey that you have taken.
I know that its hospitality will lift your heart.
Mr. Prime Minister, we hope that you find that peace which all Americans are proud to seek with you.

We are delighted to have you, sir.
[At this point Prime Minister Levi Eshkol responded briefly (see note). The President then resumed speaking.]
I know you people would want to meet Mrs. Eshkol and Mrs. Johnson.
Mr. Mayor, Congressman Gonzalez, Congressman Kazen, and other distinguished public officials, all you ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls:
It is a cold afternoon, but it is a warm welcome.
We are very proud of San Antonio and south Texas for the warmth of your welcome.

Thank all of you so much.
