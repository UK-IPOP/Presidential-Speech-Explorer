[Released September 3, 1930. Dated September 2, 1930]
I JOIN with the people of the American nation in rejoicing over the brilliant exploit of your distinguished aviators Captain Dieudonne Costes and Mr. Maurice Bellonte in successfully completing for the first time in history a nonstop flight from France to the United States.
France has established a glorious record. I hope that in the future many others of your citizens will come to us in this manner.
I extend to Your Excellency and to the people of France my heartiest congratulations.
HERBERT HOOVER
[His Excellency Gaston Doumergue, President of the French Republic, Paris, France ]
