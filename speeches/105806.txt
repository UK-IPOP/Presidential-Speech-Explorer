"During his Magical Misery bus tour this week, it is unlikely President Obama will speak with unemployed Americans, to near-bankrupt business owners, or to families struggling to survive in this economy. He is more interested in campaigning in swing states than working to solve the economic crisis that is crushing the middle class. Turning this economy around will require real leadership and the experience of someone who has actually worked in the private sector." â€“Mitt Romney
