On the heels of last night's victory, the Clinton campaign today announced its Connecticut Steering Committee, made up of community leaders from across the state who will mobilize grassroots support for Hillary leading up to Connecticut's February 5th primary.
"We need a leader who has significant experience dealing with the critical issues facing America's families today, from making sure every American finally gets the health care they need, to ensuring that all American children get a quality education, and to getting our troops out of Iraq. Hillary will fight and win -- because she has the track record to prove it," said State Representative Jason Bartlett.
"I am supporting Hillary with my heart, my head and my dreams. As the first woman to break the gender divide she is historic. As the candidate who will deliver change, for women, for families and for children, she is unequivocally accomplished. As a leader who will return our country to a position of respect around the world, she is unmatched. There is no better candidate to inspire our dreams and bring them to fruition than Hillary Clinton," said Ridgefield Democratic Town Committee Chair Susan D. Cocco.
"Hillary has a 35-year record of delivering change, and has the experience and leadership to rebuild the middle class and move our economy forward. There is no one better prepared than Hillary Clinton to take office in January 2009 and immediately start the work of turning this country around," said Adam Wood, chief of staff to the Mayor of Bridgeport.
"I'm delighted to have such strong support from across Connecticut," Clinton said. "We're going to run a grassroots campaign from Salisbury to Stonington and from Greenwich to Thompson."
