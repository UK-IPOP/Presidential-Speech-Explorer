 under the authority of the act of Congress approved September 25, 1941, 55 Stat. 732, the provisions of which have been included in section 9 of title 17 of the United States Code, as codified and enacted into positive law by the act of Congress approved July 30, 1947, 61 Stat. 652, I issued Proclamation No. 2729 of April 24, 1947 (61 Stat. 1065), which proclaimed an extension of time for compliance with the conditions and formalities prescribed by the copyright laws of the United States of America by citizens of New Zealand who had been unable to comply with such conditions and formalities because of the disruption or suspension of the facilities essential to such compliance; and
 the said section 9 of title 17 of the United States Code authorizes the President to terminate any such proclamation at any time; and
 the said Proclamation No. 2729 provides that the extension of time granted thereby shall continue in effect until such proclamation is suspended or terminated by the President; and
 it appears that the citizens of New Zealand will have had ample time to comply with the conditions and formalities prescribed by the copyright laws of the United States of America by December 29, 1950, and that termination of the proclamation as of that date would be in the interest of the United States of America:
 President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the aforesaid section 9 of title 17 of the United States Code, do hereby proclaim that the aforesaid Proclamation No. 2729 of April 24, 1947, and the extension of time granted thereby, shall terminate on December 29, 1950.
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 26th day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-fourth.
