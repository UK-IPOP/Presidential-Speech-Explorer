Enacted in 1970 under President Nixon as part of the Public Health Service Act, the Title X family planning program is a critical part of America's public health safety net. Title X family planning clinics play an essential role in delivering high-quality, affordable health care, particularly for low-income patients. They ensure access to preventive health services and quality family planning care, including accurate information and referrals—based on a patient's needs—for medical services such as birth control, STD screenings, and cancer screenings.
The 2021 HHS rule
realigns the nation's family planning program with nationally recognized standards of care; reinforces the program's emphasis on quality, equity, and dignity for all individuals who seek Title X services; and modernizes the more than 50-year-old program to better reflect the current health care system. The rule will ensure that the predominantly low-income clients who rely on Title X services as their usual source of medical care have access to the same quality health care, including full medical information and referrals, that higher-income clients and clients with private insurance are able to access.
This resolution would undermine patients' ability to make informed decisions about their health care.
