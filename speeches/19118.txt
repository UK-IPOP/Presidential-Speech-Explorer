Mr. President, Governor Carvalho Pinto, Mayor de Barros, citizens of Sao Paulo:
Yesterday I referred to a rumor I have often heard--that Sao Paulo is the fastest growing city in the world--center of Brazilian commerce and industry. Certainly it is a sincere personal pleasure to have this opportunity today to witness firsthand the mighty achievements of this fabulous community.
In addition to seeing evidence of Brazil's remarkable economic and industrial growth, I have another very special and, to me, deeply moving, mission to perform in your city. Later today, I shall have the honor of paying homage to those brave soldiers of Brazil who were my comrades-in-arms during World War II.
My nation--and all free nations--have reason to remember with gratitude Brazil's partnership in two World Wars.
You made your bases available for our common cause--bases which were truly springboards to victory. On land, sea, and air, Brazilian cooperation was of inestimable value in defeating our enemies and preserving a way of life we cherish. Gallant Brazilian blood, shed with ours, must ever remind us of our solemn, common covenant to preserve the peace, with justice and freedom for all.
I thank all of you for the warmth and cordiality of your welcome, Governor and Mr. Mayor. It is a real privilege to be here.
