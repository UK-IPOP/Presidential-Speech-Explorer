I HIGHLY appreciate this award. It is a wonderful thing. This is one of the things that makes it possible for a man to carry on in this job. You see, I receive more bricks than plaques, and when I receive a thing of this kind, it always touches me to the quick. I hope I deserve it.
The President, you know, has a job where he can't do anything outside of the line of duty. Most medals are presented because a man has done something that is outside his regular line of duty. It is very difficult for the President to find anything that is outside his line of duty, but I do appreciate this recognition, and it is highly thoughtful of you to come and present it to me. I hope I will always deserve it.
