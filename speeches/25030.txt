THE TALENTS of trained Korean scientists and engineers are a rich resource for the country's development and progress. I believe it is important that efforts on their part to advance the level of technological achievement in Korea should receive encouragement and support. If the Institute contributes toward channeling Korea's talents effectively into accelerating the pace of Korean economic growth, it will serve as an inspiring example of what can be accomplished through international cooperation in science.
