To the Columbus Citizens' Committee:
The memory of Christopher Columbus--a common heritage of the Old and New World--is even in the Atomic Age a source of inspiration to all who, under God, would search the unknown and advance the frontiers of human knowledge for the betterment of mankind. Out of courage, perseverance in purpose and unshakable confidence in his principles, he fashioned a new age in human history.
Those same qualities today can strengthen the men and women of the United States and of all freedom--loving countries in the search for prosperity with fair opportunity, for peace with justice. If we are courageous and persevering and confident, dedicated in mission and decent in purpose, as was Columbus, we too shall build a new and better world for human living.
