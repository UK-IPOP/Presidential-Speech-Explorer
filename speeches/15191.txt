Memorandum for the Heads of all Executive Departments and Agencies :

I HAVE today appointed a temporary commission to formulate recommendations for me concerning the location and use of airports. This is a matter which concerns me very much, not only at the moment but as a long term proposition.
I would like all Departments and Agencies to cooperate to the fullest extent in aiding the commission and meeting the requests for assistance which may be made by it.
