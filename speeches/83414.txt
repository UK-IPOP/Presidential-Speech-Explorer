 Small businesses create two-thirds of new private sector jobs in America, employ more than half of all workers, and account for more than half of the output of our economy. Because small businesses are vital to our prosperity, the President has taken important steps to assist small businesses and the hard working people they employ by reducing taxes, encouraging investment, and removing obstacles to growth. 
 The President has called for Association Health Plans (AHPs) to give America's working families greater access to affordable health insurance. By allowing small businesses to band together and negotiate on behalf of their employees and families, AHPs would help small businesses and employees obtain health insurance at an affordable price, much like large employers and unions.
