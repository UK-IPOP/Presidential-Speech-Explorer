MR. AMBASSADOR, I am very proud to receive these stamps that have been produced in honor of a very great lady. She was truly a person who cared. She belonged not only to the United States but to humanity throughout the world and this is a most thoughtful and generous act of yours to bring me these mementos which I shall treasure.
I want to thank you very much for coming here this afternoon.
