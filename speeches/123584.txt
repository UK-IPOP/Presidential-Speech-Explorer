 — The Cruz Campaign released the following statement on Senator Marco Rubio's no show at the 
 Convention:
"This is a final admission that Marco Rubio isn't even going to try to compete for the votes of conservatives in South Carolina or anywhere else," said Rick Tyler, Cruz Communications Director. "And who can blame him? Rubio isn't a conservative. Instead Rubio and his campaign would rather hide behind their deceptive campaign tactics and liberal record on amnesty for illegals and voting to nominate John Kerry."
