 This Initiative will make a total of $350 million available over five years to provide integrated treatment of more than 300 million people in Africa, Asia, and Latin America and target seven major NTDs: lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis); schistosomiasis (snail fever); trachoma (eye infection); onchocerciasis (river blindness); and three soil-transmitted helminthes (STHs â€“ hookworm, roundworm, whipworm).
 The new Initiative will target communities with integrated treatment annually for three to five years in order to reduce the prevalence of these diseases within these communities.
 Interventions in fighting these diseases promise large economic payoffs as they improve educational outcomes and worker productivity.
 Combined with U.S. efforts, the entire G-8 would provide sufficient funding for control and elimination of NTDs in Sub-Saharan Africa and high burden countries in Asia and Latin America.
 Most of these diseases either blind, deform, or debilitate their victims. They can reduce school enrollment, diminish childhood growth and cognitive development, and reduce economic productivity in adults.
 These donations are valued at hundreds of millions of dollars each year, and reduce the estimated cost for other program components to less than 40 cents per person per year in Sub-Saharan Africa.
 The current program has shown significant success by reaching 14 million people in five countries.
 These countries will have the opportunity to be selected based on a competitive grants process to receive additional support. This will ensure an integrated country specific approach to fighting NTDs.
