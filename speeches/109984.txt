Expanding collaboration based on the 
 that President Obama and Prime Minister Cameron announced in May 2011, Peace Corps and VSO are leveraging the resources of both organizations to improve the lives of poor and marginalized people, and to promote the value of volunteering in global development. Peace Corps and VSO are exchanging knowledge and collaborating on key development interests, building on our nations' shared history of volunteerism.

Peace Corps and VSO are leading global organizations that fight poverty by using the power of people and volunteers to bring about lasting change. Both organizations are founded on an approach that puts people first, and fosters capacity building and knowledge exchange in a way that transforms poor and marginalized communities worldwide. Peace Corps and VSO's joint network of more than 10,000 currently serving volunteers in nearly 95 countries, combined with an alumni base of more than 250,000 former volunteers, will enhance global volunteerism efforts and create lasting change.

Peace Corps and VSO have collaborated for more than a decade. This initiative formalizes the partnership and will increase the global impact of the efforts of both organizations. Volunteers will work alongside local communities and partner organizations on development priorities, and help them build a lasting legacy of local volunteerism, creating a real and sustainable difference in people's lives.
