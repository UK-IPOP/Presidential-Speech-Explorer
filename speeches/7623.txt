I WILL be obliged if you will express my cordial greetings to the meeting this evening of the National Eucharistic Congress at which I am informed you will preside and my appreciation of the value of spiritual ideals and of religious observance in the life of the nation which are indispensable foundations of the social order and of enduring political institutions.
HERBERT HOOVER
