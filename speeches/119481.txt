Today, First Lady Michelle Obama announced two commencement challenges via video as part of her Reach Higher initiative. Schools choosing to participate in the challenges will create video submissions to capture their efforts to make attending and completing college a reality for all students. Finalists could have the opportunity to hear from the First Lady at their commencement ceremonies in the spring of 2015.

The Reach Higher initiative is the First Lady's effort to inspire every student in America to take charge of their future by completing their education past high school, whether at a professional training program, a community college, or a four-year college or university. In today's economy, a high school diploma just isn't enough. Students have to "reach higher," which is why the First Lady is working to rally the country around the President's "North Star" goal â€” that by 2020, America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world.

The First Lady's "FAFSA Completion Challenge" video urges high schools to increase Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) completion rates among their seniors.

The First Lady's "Near-Peer Mentoring College Challenge," directed at college communities and institutes of higher education, urges them to increase and enhance near-peer mentoring and college immersion experiences on campus for high school students. Research has shown that students connecting with other students, or "near-peers," can make a significant difference in motivating them to make higher education a reality.
