To the Congress of the United States:
I am transmitting herewith the first Report on the Mutual Security Program, covering operations in furtherance of the purposes of the Mutual Security Act of 1951 (P.L. 165, 82d Congress). The Report reviews the steps we are taking with other nations to build up the strength of the free world, in support of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.
Although the Mutual Security Program requires us to spend large amounts for troops and weapons, it is a program for peace. Its ultimate success will come when the troops and weapons are no longer needed, and the monies now required for defense can be used to raise the living standards of our own and other nations who are truly devoted to peace.
HARRY S. TRUMAN
