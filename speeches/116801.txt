This afternoon, the President and Vice President met in the Situation Room with the President's Homeland Security Council to discuss the urgent humanitarian situation at the border as well as the comprehensive response that the Administration has implemented at the President's direction. Today's meeting took place as preliminary data show that average daily apprehensions of unaccompanied children by the Customs and Border Patrol have dropped by about half from June to July. This important decline was noted, and the Council committed to continuing aggressive efforts on both sides of the border to deter illegal migration—including by sustaining cooperation with Central American leaders—and to providing appropriate care for those apprehended at the border. Participants also discussed combating the root causes of migration and the need to secure the additional resources sought in the President's supplemental appropriations request.

About the Homeland Security Council:
The Homeland Security Council was created by Executive Order in 2001 and codified in statute by the Homeland Security Act of 2002. Similar to the National Security Council, which is also a statutory body, the Homeland Security Council serves to coordinate across the government on homeland security issues. In 2009, the Homeland Security Council and National Security Council were integrated under one staff, but both continue to exist by statute. Meetings of either are convened as needed.
