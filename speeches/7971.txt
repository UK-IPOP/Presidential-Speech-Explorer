To Commander Byrd:
I know that I speak for the American people when I express their universal pleasure at your successful flight over the South Pole. We are proud of your courage and your leadership. We are glad of proof that the spirit of great adventure still lives.
Our thoughts include also appreciation of your companions in flight and your colleagues, whose careful and devoted preparation has contributed to your great success.
HERBERT HOOVER
