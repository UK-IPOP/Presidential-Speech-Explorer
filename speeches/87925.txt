"So in my State of the Union Address next Tuesday, I will propose a tax reform designed to help make basic private health insurance more affordable – whether you get it through your job or on your own."
 (Press Release, Senate Democratic Communications Center, 1/22/07)
 The standard deduction for health insurance would be like the standard deduction for dependents. This proposal will result in lower taxes for about 80 percent of employer-provided policies. Those with more generous policies (20 percent) will have the option to adjust their compensation to have lower premiums and higher wages to offset the tax change. In the aggregate, this results in a tax cut for the middle class. For example:
 In 2009, the President's proposal would reduce the after-tax cost of the average-priced policy by 75 percent – from $6,100 to $1,555.
 The average tax bill for this group would decline by $3,650 in 2009.
 The President's proposal will lower the average tax bill of a family without health insurance by $3,350 in 2009.
 Uninsured Americans who purchase health insurance would receive significant tax relief as a result of the President's proposal. This will provide a significant incentive to all working Americans to purchase insurance coverage, thereby reducing the number of uninsured Americans.
 To further lower health care costs, the President has proposed Association Health Plans (AHPs) and medical liability reforms, and implemented policies to encourage health information technology and price transparency.
