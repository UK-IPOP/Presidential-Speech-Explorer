I AM profoundly sorry to hear of the death of your brother. His personality endeared him to all who knew him. His loss will be keenly felt by many thousands who never saw him, for he enriched our knowledge of one of the most important fields of culture, stimulated others to a wider appreciation of dramatic art, and inspired many younger men to do creative literary work.
