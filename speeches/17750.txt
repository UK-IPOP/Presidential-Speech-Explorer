President Rhee, Mrs. Rhee and [fiends of this distinguished group:
I think I speak for each of us when I assure you, President and Mrs. Rhee, that anyone here would be honored by your invitation to any place. We are delighted that you arranged to have this dinner served in a place where so many of your good friends, friends of ours, of Koreans, could join in order to pay their tribute to your courage, to your friendliness, to your stamina, and to the great gallantry of your people.
We hope that when you go back to your country, you will be able to impart to them something of the warmth that you say you have felt coming from our hearts, from our minds, so that they will understand that in spite of distance, in spite of occasional differences, that those people who love freedom, who are ready to fight for freedom, are truly brothers--are truly comrades-in-arms, and are ready always to sacrifice together.
Methods and means are points on which we meet to discuss and confer. We do not always see the answers clearly in any one day, but we do know, as history has so often shown, that if we remain true to a cause, if we forget not the great spiritual basis that is the foundation for every system of free government, then in the long run tyranny cannot prevail, and freedom will.
So to you and Mrs. Rhee, we thank you for coming over to this country, for taking the trouble to learn again something new about us, possibly. You, who have lived amongst us so long, possibly did not yourselves need such reassurance; but it is possibly very fine for your people that you can come back now and say not only were the American people friends in 1948 and 1950, and 1951 and 1952, but they are still the friends of Korea--and we hope that the Koreans are our friends.
And so I am sure that this company will feel highly honored to join with me now in a Toast to your gallant people, to you and to Mrs. Rhee, drunk in your name as their symbol and their leader.
President Rhee!
