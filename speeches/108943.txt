  


Nate Silver of the New York Times has put together a 
, President Obama's approval rating and the ideological record of the candidate. 



Jon Huntsman ranks as the candidate most likely to defeat President Obama.



This is just another confirmation of what we've been saying all along. 
 in November 2012 based on his record as a Governor, businessman, Ambassador and what the Wall Street Journal says is the best economic plan.



I am proud to support him for President.



Please share this blog with your friends on facebook and twitter across the nation and tell them to visit 
 to learn more about the most electable Republican candidate.



Sincerely,



Governor Tom Ridge



PS The New York Times is 
:  Jon Huntsman is the best candidate to defeat President Obama next fall.  If you agree I urge you 
 to his campaign in the amount you can afford.
