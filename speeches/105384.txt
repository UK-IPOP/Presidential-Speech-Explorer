 â€” Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann has issued the following statement on the tenth anniversary of the terrorist attacks of 9/11:
"Today we pause to pray for the families and to remember the victims of 9/11. Ten years ago today, at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and on Flight 93, we witnessed terrible tragedy and remarkable bravery. For those who survived the attacks and for those who lost loved ones, I pray that you will experience God's comfort today. For those first responders and everyday heroes who displayed tremendous bravery and self-sacrifice by putting their lives on the line to save others, and for our men and women in uniform who took the War on Terror to the terrorists, I hope that today you will know the deep gratitude of a thankful nation.
"We shared the horror of that day together as a nation. The events shook our country and our reality. Yet our enemies were mistaken when they imagined weakness in our country. This past decade has proven that an attack on one is an attack on all and the American spirit has prevailed. God has graciously blessed our land with courage, strength, and freedom, and I hope you will join me in praying that he will continue to bless the United States of America."
