  "We are committed to protecting the hemisphere's natural resources. That's why I am committed to using the Tropical Forest Conservation Act to help countries redirect debt payment towards local projects that will protect biodiversity and tropical forests."
President George W. Bush

  April 21, 2001
The Tropical Forest Conservation Act (TFCA) is a unique and valuable mechanism that funds activities to protect tropical forests in developing countries through debt relief agreements. Under the program, eligible countries can engage in a debt swap, buyback, or reduction/restructuring.
Local currency payments resulting from the debt treatment go into a Tropical Forest Fund in the eligible country. Grants are made from the Fund to local NGOs and other entities that engage in conservation activities. Benefits of the TFCA Program include:
Program Status: The President's budget makes over $30 million available for TFCA in FY 2002. As the program demonstrates success, President Bush is committed to working with Congress to increase funding.
