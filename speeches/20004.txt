 our people in increasing numbers are taking part in boating activities on the waters of the Nation, and it is estimated that approximately twenty-eight million will participate in such activities during 1958; and
 safety is essential for the full enjoyment of boating, and safe boating practices will result in the saving of many lives and in the avoidance of injuries and property damage; and
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved June 4, 1958, has authorized and requested the President of the United States to proclaim annually the week which includes July 4 as National Safe Boating Week:
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning June 29, 1958, as National Safe Boating Week.
I urge boating organizations, the boat industry, Government agencies, and all other organizations and all individuals interested in boating, to join in the observance of National Safe Boating Week; and I ask them to do their utmost during that week and throughout the year to make boating a safe and enjoyable activity.
I also invite the Governors of the States, Territories, and possessions of the United States to provide for the observance of National Safe Boating Week in order to focus universal attention on the importance of safe boating practices.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 4th day of June in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-second.
