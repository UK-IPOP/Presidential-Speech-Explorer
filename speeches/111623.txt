"I think it's very disappointing for the future of the economy. It's about half of what potential growth actually is in the American economy and recoveries should be much more vigorous even after a financial crisis. If we keep up at this rate, over the next year or two, we will simply never get back to full employment. It's not good news." — Glenn Hubbard, Romney Campaign Economic Adviser
 "The U.S. economy expanded at a slower pace in the second quarter as a softening job market prompted Americans to curb spending. Gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services produced, rose at a 1.5 percent annual rate after a revised 2 percent gain in the prior quarter, Commerce Department figures showed today in Washington."

 "The most alarming sign Thursday was a report from the Commerce Department on business orders for durable goods, items expected to last at least three years. While overall orders rose 1.6 percent in June from May, the increase was driven mostly by a surge in volatile aircraft orders. When excluding aircraft and other transportation equipment, orders fell 1.1 percent — the third decline in four months. And orders for so-called core capital goods, which indicate business investment plans, dropped 1.4 percent, also the third decline in four months. Businesses placed fewer orders for industrial machinery, computers, and autos in June." (Christopher S. Rugaber, "US Economy Looks Weaker, Business Confidence Dims,"

 "New single-family home sales in June fell by the most in more than a year and prices resumed their downward trend, suggesting a setback for the budding housing market recovery. The Commerce Department said on Wednesday sales tumbled 8.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted 350,000-unit annual rate, the lowest rate in five months. The percent decline was the largest since February 2011." (Lucia Mutikani, "New Home Sales Post Biggest Drop In Over One Year,"

 "Growth in the U.S. manufacturing sector slowed in July to the second-weakest level since the country emerged from recession, according to a survey released Tuesday. The Markit flash U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers index dropped to 51.8 from 52.5 in June, which is the worst level since December 2010 and second-worst since late 2009. Any readings above 50 indicate an improvement from the prior month." (Steve Goldstein, "U.S. Manufacturing Growth 2nd-Worst Post-Recession,"

 "While this quarter's earnings reports have crossed a substantially lowered profit bar, future expectations through the year indicate a recession could be on the way. Estimates for the third and fourth quarters have been dropped to levels not seen since the days of the 2008 financial crisis, below even the muted 2 percent expected level of inflation."
