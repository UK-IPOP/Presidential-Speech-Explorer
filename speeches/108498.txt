Paying tribute to America's veterans, Presidential hopeful Herman Cain teams up with highly decorated Colonel Michael Steele to offer a powerful and moving message to the men, women, and families of our armed services. Colonel Steele was the company commander of the Third Batallion 75th Ranger Regiment, during Operation Gothic Serpent, the basis for the book and subsequent movie, "Blackhawk Down." Veterans Day is celebrated on November 11th, the anniversary of the signing of the Armistice that ended World War I, formally ended at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918. From the Berlin Wall to Mogadishu to Iraq, Colonel Steele has served his country well, and Herman Cain is honored to have a friendship with a man so respected and decorated as the Colonel. Please join us in honoring our proud and heroic Veterans on this and every day.
Thank-you and God bless all our servicemen and women, and God bless America.
