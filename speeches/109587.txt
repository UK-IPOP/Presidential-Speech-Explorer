"If President Obama wins a second term, he will not be restrained by having to answer to voters again. Unfortunately, our economy will continue to be restrained by the disastrous fiscal policies that have brought us four straight trillion-dollar deficits and historic growth in the national debt. America truly can't afford four more years of Barack Obama." —Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 "A new analysis of President Barack Obama's budget for next year says the deficit scenario for next year isn't as rosy as the White House figured last month. Friday's Congressional Budget Office report said Obama's budget would produce a $977 billion deficit next year — $75 billion more than predicted by the White House."

 "The National Debt has now increased more during President Obama's three years and two months in office than it did during 8 years of the George W. Bush presidency. The Debt rose $4.899 trillion during the two terms of the Bush presidency. It has now gone up $4.939 trillion since President Obama took office."

 "But the Bipartisan Policy Center said Friday that the debt-limit doomsday could come earlier than that. Analysts from the Bipartisan Policy Center projected that the United States will hit its $16.4 trillion debt ceiling between late November 2012 and early January 2013 due to lower-than-expected corporate tax revenues and the recent extension of the payroll tax holiday."

 "Democrats in the House, Senate, and White House have all signaled unwillingness to sign off on a debt-ceiling hike that does not carry into 2013. Obama has vowed to veto an extension of borrowing authority that does not last into 2013 — after the presidential election."
