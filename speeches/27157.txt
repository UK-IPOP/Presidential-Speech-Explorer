EVERY American should be gratified by Congress' prompt action in extending the "no strike" period in the railroad dispute.
The "no strike" period under the Railway Labor Act would have expired at midnight tomorrow. Today's action extends that period for an additional 20 days.
In responding to that emergency so quickly after the resolution was presented, Congress has well-earned the Nation's gratitude.
I now urge both the carriers and the workers to use every hour of these 20 days to negotiate in earnest in an attempt to reach an equitable decision in the American way of true collective bargaining.
Otherwise, Congress will again be required to help avoid the many terrible consequences that will flow from a nationwide rail strike.
