AUSTIN â€” The Perry campaign today released a 30-second television advertisement entitled "Part-Time Congress," which will air on Iowa broadcast and cable.
Announcer: "If Washington's the problem, why trust a congressman to fix it?"
"Among them, they've spent 63 years in Congress, leaving us with debt, earmarks, and bailouts."
"Congressmen get $174,000 a year and you get the bill."
"We need a solution."
Gov. Perry: "That's the reason I've called for a part-time Congress. Cut their pay in half, cut their time in Washington in half, cut their staff in half, send them home. Let them get a job like everybody else back home has."
"I'm Rick Perry, and I approve this message."
