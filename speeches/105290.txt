Today, Romney for President released a new web video, "Stop The Spending." The video highlights the failure of President Obama's $787 billion stimulus to create jobs and help small businesses.
: 
 "In 2009 President Obama's $787 Billion Dollar Stimulus Passed"
 "Over the next two years, this plan will save or create 3.5 million jobs. More than 90% of these jobs will be in the private sector."
 "Promising Jobs And Relief To Small Businesses"
 "Since Then..."
 "1.7 Million Additional Jobs Were Lost"
 "And More Than 25 Million Americans Are Out Of Work Or Struggling With Employment"
 "We Asked Private Sector Job Creators How The Stimulus Affected Them"
 "My name is Ben Stratton."
 "I am an interior designer."
 "Obama's stimulus bill did not help me as a small business owner."
 "We have not obviously seen the results of that."
 "I think it's harmed my business."
 "Absolutely no benefit from it in my business."
 "I'm not seeing the money that's being spent falling into the hands of our customers."
 "Now President Obama Wants Another Stimulus"
 "[N]ew way forward on jobs to grow the economy and put more Americans back to work right now."
 "It's really frustrating to hear that there might be a second stimulus bill that's going to be passed."
 "Obviously it hasn't worked."
 "It would be a total waste of money."
 "And as a business owner I can't go out and spend more than I make."
 "It will get to the point where you can't recover."
 "Spending is totally out of control."
 "I won't sign a bill that adds one dime to our deficit -- either now or in the future. Period."
 "Today's National Debt"
 "Where Are The Jobs?"
