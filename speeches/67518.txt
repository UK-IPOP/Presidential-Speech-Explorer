MR. MCCURRY: Very briefly, we have preliminary information -- a CH46E Sea Knight helicopter, which is part of the Nighthawk fleet that transports members of the President's entourage -- specifically, you, the press corps -- rolled over and apparently was destroyed in a fire at the Orlando Executive Airport here. It was on its way from Miami, where it was servicing the President's entourage yesterday en route back to its base in Quantico. There is a crew normally on a Nighthawk of four to five. Our understanding is that all crew members escaped without any injury.
We are developing more information on this. It will be briefed at their regular daily briefing at 1:30 p.m. Okay. That's all I've got.
