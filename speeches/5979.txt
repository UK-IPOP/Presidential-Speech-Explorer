The American people by a great plurality have decided in favor of Mr. Wilson and the Democratic Party. Like all other good citizens, I accept the result with entire good humor and contentment. As for the Progressive cause, I can only repeat what I have already so many times declared, the fate of the leader for the time being is of little consequence, but the cause itself must in the end triumph, for its triumph is essential to the well-being of the American people.
