 "'We are a nation of laws,' [Romney spokesman Eric] Fehrnstrom said. 'In the case of immigration, our laws are being broken every day. In the past, Romney has vetoed legislation to provide tuition breaks to illegals. He's opposed to giving them driver's licenses. He doesn't think the government should be condoning illegal behavior.'" (Rebecca Fater, "Feds Say State Can Bust Illegal Immigrants,"

 "'I know exactly what Governor Spitzer's trying to do, and it makes a lot of sense because he's trying to get people out of the shadows.

 SEN. BARACK OBAMA: "I think that it is a -- the right idea. And I disagree with Chris, because there is a public safety concern. We can make sure that drivers who are illegal come out of the shadows, that they can be tracked, that they are properly trained, and that will make our roads safer. That doesn't negate the need for us to reform illegal immigration." (MSNBC, Democrat Presidential Candidate Debate, Philadelphia, PA, 10/30/07)
