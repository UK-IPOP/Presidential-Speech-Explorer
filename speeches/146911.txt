Promoting democratic values and good governance has been a core component of the Summit of the Americas since the first Summit in 1994, with leaders at the Third Summit in 2001 articulating the principles that would later be embodied in the Inter-American Democratic Charter and pledging to further fight corruption that undermines democratic governance at the Eight Summit in 2018. This Summit, with the theme "Building a Sustainable, Resilient, and Equitable Future," continue this tradition. Our Administration and partners will push back against the threats to our democracies by fortifying democratic institutions, investing in civil society, strengthening independent media, and following through on a regional digital transformation that is transparent and equitable.
