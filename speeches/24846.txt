[Released August 13, 1965. Dated August 11, 1965] THE COMMISSION'S primary assignment is to conduct the first systematic, nationwide study of the entire spectrum of crime problems. The mounting crime rate and the unprecedented increase in the incidence of juvenile delinquency are matters of deep concern to me and to most Americans. As you know, I sent a special message concerning these problems to the Congress on March 8, 1965, and have recommended the enactment of certain new legislation designed to combat those problems.
However, that new legislation is but a beginning and there is still much to be done. I am convinced that you and your distinguished colleagues on the Commission can and will make significant contributions to this drive to devise means to eradicate lawlessness, disrespect for the law, and the causes thereof.
