 Since August 2003, more than 8.3 million jobs have been created, with more than 1.5 million jobs created over the 12 months that ended in November. Our economy has now added jobs for 51 straight months â€“ the longest period of uninterrupted job growth on record. The unemployment rate remains low at 4.7 percent.
 Congressional leaders are now talking about piling the remaining bills into one giant piece of legislation, which they will load up with billions of dollars in earmarks and wasteful spending leading to higher taxes.
 Recently, the House of Representatives and the Senate took a positive step by voting to pass the Peru free trade agreement; now Congress should act quickly to approve the free trade agreement with Colombia. This vital agreement with our strong ally is important to the stability of the region and would benefit American workers and farmers by eliminating tariffs on most U.S. industrial and agricultural goods exports and providing new market access for U.S. service suppliers. Congress should also reauthorize and improve the Trade Adjustment Assistance program to help workers impacted by trade take advantage of this growing, dynamic economy.
