 the preamble to Public Resolution No. 33, Seventy-fifth Congress, first session, approved May 27, 1937, requesting the President to proclaim the tercentenary of the birth of Pere Jacques Marquette, recites:
 the 1st day of June 1937 marks the three-hundredth anniversary of the birth of Pere Jacques Marquette, the first white man to explore the upper Mississippi Valley: and
 it is eminently fitting that the tercentenary of the birth of this zealous missionary and fearless explorer should be commemorated by suitable patriotic, religious, and public exercises during such year:

, President of the United States, do hereby direct all Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on the first day of June 1937, and I invite all people of the United States to observe that day and anniversary year in schools, churches, and other suitable places with appropriate ceremonies commemorating the tercentenary of the birth of Pere Jacques Marquette.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 27th day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-first.
