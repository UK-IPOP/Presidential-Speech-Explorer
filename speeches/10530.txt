Gentlemen:
I thank you warmly for your kind invitation to attend the testimonial dinner in honor of Dr. James Ewing on January 31st, and deeply regret that my duties here do not permit me to be present. I should like to share in person in paying honor to such a useful and distinguished citizen, whose work as scientific researcher, teacher, and author has done so much to forward the attack upon the problem of cancer in particular and of disease in general. Such a career is a service and an inspiration to humanity, and deserves the tribute of public praise.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
