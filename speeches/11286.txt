 Section 509 of the Sugar Act of 1937 (50 Stat. 903, 916), as amended, provides, in part:
"Whenever the President finds and proclaims that a national economic or other emergency exists with respect to sugar or liquid sugar, he shall by proclamation suspend the operation of title II or III above, which he determines, on the basis of such findings, should be suspended, and, thereafter, the operation of any such title shall continue in suspense until the President finds and proclaims that the facts which occasioned such suspension no longer exist . . ."; and
 the outbreak of war has resulted in dislocation of sugar supplies from certain customary sources; and
 such dislocation of supplies has brought about a shortage of sugar required to meet the needs of consumers; and
 it is possible to obtain sugar from areas not included, or not adequately included, in the quota provisions of that Act:
 President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the foregoing provision of the Sugar Act of 1937, as amended, do hereby find and proclaim that a national economic emergency exists with respect to sugar and do by this proclamation suspend the operation of title II of that Act.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done at the City of Washington this 13th day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-two and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-sixth.
FRANKLIN D ROOSEVELT
