 Reauthorizing No Child Left Behind (NCLB) is one of the President's top priorities for this year. We must raise the bar and strengthen this law to ensure our children have the skills to compete and succeed in the global economy. There can be no compromise on NCLB's core principles, including:
 In the five years since No Child Left Behind was passed:
 We will improve our high schools by increasing accountability for results and ensuring students graduate ready for college and the global economy. We will also expand access to Advanced Placement courses and encourage all students to complete a rigorous course of study.
 The President's FY 2008 Budget will increase Federal support for underperforming schools by more than $400 million – to a total of more than $1 billion next year.
 When schools underperform for several years, NCLB gives parents real options: They can enroll their children in free tutoring – or transfer them to a better-performing traditional public or charter school. The Department of Education will work with States and districts to help more students take advantage of free tutoring and to help expand school choice.
 This includes allowing high-quality growth models to give schools credit for improvement from year-to-year and provide another way to show whether achievement gaps are closing.States with well-established assessments and robust data systems may use growth models in their overall accountability system. Growth models allow States to measure individual students' progress over time.
