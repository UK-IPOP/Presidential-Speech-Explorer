AT THE INVITATION of the President, legislative leaders of both parties and the Chairmen and ranking members of three Committees of both Houses of the Congress met this morning in the Cabinet Room at the White House.
The President opened the meeting by saying it was essential to have a continuing bi-partisan approach to foreign affairs and national security matters that would represent the best interests of our nation, regardless of which political party controlled the Congress.
The Secretary of State, as he has done many times in the past, presented a complete review of the international situation--this time bringing the legislative members up to date on foreign developments since the adjournment of the Congress last August. He discussed the participation by the United States in the Manila, London and Paris Conferences, the Trieste and Saar settlements, and the President's proposal to the United Nations for an "atoms for peace" pool. Against this background, the Secretary outlined the policies which would guide the future conduct of our international relations.
In this connection, the President and the Secretary urged the legislative leaders to give early consideration at the next regular session of the Congress to ratification of the Manila Pact and those sections of the Paris Agreements which would grant sovereignty to the Federal Republic of Germany and admit that nation to membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Such action by the Congress would greatly strengthen the defenses of the free world against Communist aggression.
Together with the Secretaries of State and Defense, the President discussed with the leaders the security and defense plans of our Country and the steps we have taken and propose to take to strengthen the armed forces of our friends and allies throughout the world.
A general discussion and exchange of views were held thereafter on these subjects.
