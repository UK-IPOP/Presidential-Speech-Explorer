 The South Carolina Hillary campaign announced the results of the Women for Hillary month-long grassroots drive in October, signing up 1,000 new members and announcing the four state co-chairs who will lead the effort to energize South Carolina Women for Hillary. "More than a thousand women signed up for this grassroots organization, in every part of the state. Rural and urban, black and white, young and old, women from all walks of life are coming together behind Hillary's campaign to bring the change we need," County Councilwoman Gracie Floyd of Anderson said. Floyd, Charleston County Councilwoman Colleen Condon, Florence political activist Marguerite Willis and former South Carolina Democratic Women's Council President Louisiana Wright of Aiken will co-chair the organization as it rallies South Carolina women voters in support of Hillary and brings them to the polls in the January primary. "We're more than a thousand strong. We're organized and we're ready to get to work to make Hillary our next President," Condon said. The organization will be hosting house parties, operating canvassing and phone bank efforts and organizing get out the vote operations for Hillary. "We're organizing women voters in every corner of the state, but it's broader than just that," Willis, wife of Florence Mayor Frank Willis, said. "We're supporting Hillary because she's the best qualified, most experienced person for the job." Wright agreed, pointing to Hillary's work on issues relevant to South Carolina. "Whether it's fighting for our families and family leave, fighting global warming and building a 'green economy' in South Carolina, providing universal health care or making college more affordable, Hillary has the vision and the experience to go to work from the day she's elected," Wright said.
