"When President Obama first took office, he promised that his stimulus would help rescue the economy. He even commissioned a report that showed it would lower the unemployment rate to 5.6% by mid-2012, saying it showed 'exactly' what the plan would mean for America. By his own standard, President Obama has failed — and middle-class families have suffered the consequences. If President Obama had kept his promise, over 8 million more Americans would have jobs today. Unlike President Obama, Mitt Romney has a pro-growth plan to finally get our economy back on the right track." —Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson

Because this is about getting this out and spent in 18 months to create 3.5 million jobs and do — to set — tee this up so the rest of the good work that's being done here literally drop-kicks us out of this recession and we begin to grow again and begin to grow again." (Vice President Joe Biden,

 "The numbers are staggering. The ranks of the long-term unemployed swelled last month from 5.1 million to 5.4 million, and those individuals now account for 42.8% of the unemployed. Meanwhile, the average length of time the unemployed have spent out of work has climbed steadily higher -- and older Americans have been the hardest hit."

 "The nation's jobs picture dimmed in May as employers added just 69,000 jobs and the unemployment rate ticked up to 8.2 percent, a continuation of a long, slow employment recovery that began 33 months ago." (Susanna Kim, "May Unemployment Rises To 8.2 Pct.,"
