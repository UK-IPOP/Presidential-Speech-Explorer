HELLO, Admiral, I want to express all of our thanks to you and to send our very best wishes to all those who served in the "110." I know its record very well. And I know from the letters which my family received during the Second World War how much my brother valued his association with this distinguished squadron which had an outstanding record in the winter, spring, and the summer patrolling the Bay of Biscay.
I know something about the number of men who were lost in that difficult and dangerous service with the Coastal Command, and I take the greatest pride and satisfaction in extending our very best wishes to all of them.
The war is now 20 years past, but I think that they can all take the strongest pride in having served their country during difficult and dangerous days in a service which required the utmost in skill and courage, and I know that all of you, Admiral, who are meeting now have happy recollections of those who served in the squadron who did not return.
I think it is appropriate as we look to the future of our country that we also recall those who served it in times past. So I wish you would extend to all who were there my very best greetings. I share with them a satisfaction in what they did for the United States. It sets an example for all those who came after, and I know that my brother and all those others who served with the squadron who are not with you are with you tonight in spirit.

Thank you very much, Admiral.
