 Over the next 24 to 72 hours, more than 7,000 additional active duty troops will arrive in the affected areas. Right now there are more than 21,000 National Guard troops operating in affected areas, with more on the way. In addition to these National Guard forces, the Department of Defense has already deployed more than 4,000 active duty forces to assist in search and recovery, and provide logistical and medical support. The priority is to restore and maintain law and order, and assist in recovery and evacuation efforts. The enormity of the task requires more resources and more troops.
 President Bush visited areas of Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana affected by the enormous devastation of Hurricane Katrina. A vast coastline of towns and communities has been flattened; one of our great cities is submerged. The human costs are incalculable. The President surveyed the destruction and spoke with victims of Katrina to express the nation's condolences for their loss. The President also thanked those working to aid in the recovery effort.
