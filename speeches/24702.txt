[Released November 26, 1965. Dated November 25, 1965] Your Highness:
It is with deep regret that I have learned of the death of Shaikh Abdullah al-Salim al-Sabah. He will be long remembered for the notable progress of his country during the more than 15 years of his leadership and for his wise guidance of Kuwait into the ranks of independent, peace-loving nations. He was highly esteemed and admired in this country.
