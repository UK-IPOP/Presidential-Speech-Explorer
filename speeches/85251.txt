Today's Presidential Action
Today, President Bush Delivered Remarks On Energy Policy At The Small Business Administration's National Small Business Week Conference In Washington, D.C. The President stressed the need to promote greater energy independence by harnessing the power of technology to create new sources of energy and make more efficient use of existing resources. The President outlined his broad vision for moving America toward greater energy independence and announced five new energy policy initiatives:
 Over the past decade, America's energy consumption has increased by more than 12 percent, yet domestic production has increased by less than 0.5 percent.
 President Bush supports diversifying the nation's energy supply to promote energy independence, including renewable resources such as wind, solar, and geothermal energy.
 Technological advances provide products that offer consumers better performance at lower costs while using less energy.
 The market for energy is a global one, and America is not the only consumer. Today's energy price increases directly result from the fact that both U.S. and foreign demand is growing at a faster rate than the global supply of energy.
