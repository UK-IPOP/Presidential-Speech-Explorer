Mitt Romney today announced additional endorsements of elected officials and leaders in Georgia.
"Georgia is important to my campaign and I am thrilled to be receiving the support of so many of its great leaders," said Mitt Romney. "We will work together closely to reverse the failed policies of the last three years and get our economy heading in the right direction."
"I am excited to see so many great Georgians joining me in supporting Governor Romney," said Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens. "His experience is unmatched and he is the only candidate with the right set of skills we need to move our country forward into prosperity."
Attorney General Olens previously endorsed Governor Romney along with Public Service Commissioner Doug Everett, former Speaker Mark Burkhalter, House Majority Whip Ed Lindsey, State Senator Bill Hamrick, State Representative Calvin Hill, State Representative Wendell Willard, and State Representative Bruce Williamson.
