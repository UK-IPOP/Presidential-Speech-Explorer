Mitt Romney announced today the support of former Attorneys General William Barr and Michael Mukasey, former Deputy Attorneys General George Terwilliger and Mark Filip, and former Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division Alice Fisher.
In addition to their deep leadership experience at the Department of Justice, these distinguished attorneys have extensive judicial, prosecutorial, and private practice experience. They will advise Governor Romney on all matters related to the rule of law and will co-chair the campaign's Law Enforcement Advisory Group.
"Bill Barr, Michael Mukasey, George Terwilliger, Mark Filip, and Alice Fisher have served this nation with distinction at the highest levels of federal law enforcement," Governor Romney said. "I am honored to have their support and advice as we address the range of pressing legal issues facing the country."
Barr, Mukasey, Terwilliger, Filip, and Fisher issued this joint statement: "Mitt Romney deeply understands the importance of maintaining the integrity of our laws and vigorously enforcing them. His record as Governor demonstrates his commitment to the security of the people he is charged to defend and to the rule of law as the basis of a free society. We look forward to advising Governor Romney and we are proud to support him."
