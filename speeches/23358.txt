I AM pleased to approve S. 405, "To authorize the Secretary of the Interior to construct, operate, and maintain the Mann Creek Federal Reclamation Project, Idaho."
I understand that the main objective of this project is to conserve spring run-off, which is now lost, and thereby provide a more reliable source of irrigation water. This water conservation not only will permit diversification in crops for which there is a ready market, but also will help prevent the damage that can occur from spring floods. In doing these things the project strengthens the economic base of a community and thereby benefits the Nation as a whole as well as the State of Idaho.
