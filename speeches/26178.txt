DR. CHARLES WILLIAM MAYO was one of those rare men whose talents touch and enrich the lives of men everywhere. He won fame as a surgeon and medical administrator; the name of the great medical institution he headed has become a symbol of hope the world over; he was a real pioneer in group medical practice. In addition, Charles Mayo was a gifted educator, author, editor, and public servant. All of us are grateful for the life he lived--and saddened by his death.
