Mr. President, Mr. Foreign Minister, Mr. Secretary:
As we conclude our talks, I think back to the time 13 months ago that I assumed this office. I recall then that one of the major objectives of our foreign policy was to restore a better relationship with our oldest ally in the world, the Republic of France.
That process began on the trip to France that I took soon after coming into office, in February, and it has continued in the discussions I have had with President Pompidou on this occasion, and the discussions that Secretary Rogers and others in the State, Defense, and Treasury Departments have had with the members of the President's party.
I can say now that I believe we have made very great progress over this past year in restoring the kind of relationship that should exist between two nations whose alliance over a period of 190 years has consistently served the cause of peace and the cause of freedom in the world.
We have not agreed on everything, but we have found that our areas of agreement are greater than they were when our talks began, and we have established channels of communication for further discussions that we believe will be very productive and constructive, not only in our bilateral relationship but also in the ability of our two nations to work together for peace and stability in all areas of the world.
And Mr. President, as you leave here and go first to Florida and then to California, then to Chicago and back to New York, I can assure you that the great majority of our people will welcome you as the President of the nation that has been our oldest ally and our oldest friend. And we know that as you travel through our country that you will sense that welcome and when you return to France, we want you to extend to the people of your country the warmest good wishes of the people of the United States.
