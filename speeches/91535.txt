CEDAR RAPIDS, IA -- Speaking to fire fighters in Iowa today, Governor Bill Richardson announced his plan for America's fire fighters and police officers, including guaranteeing health care between retirement and the age of Medicare eligibility.
"One of the things that I have been hearing from fire fighters is this problem with the health care gap," Governor Richardson said. "We have to guarantee quality health care for retired fire fighters and police officers who have served their communities for twenty years. The federal government should partner 50-50 with the states to provide high-quality coverage for fire fighters and police officers from the time they retire until the time they reach Medicare age."
Richardson also strongly supports presumptive disability for fire fighters and improvements in workers' compensation.
"I have stood with the fire fighters throughout my career and I am proud of my strong and extensive record as Governor of New Mexico," Richardson said. "Within a month after I was elected Governor, I restored collective bargaining rights for fire fighters and all public employees. We have card check and fair share in my state. We have done it in New Mexico."
"I have been a Congressman, UN Ambassador, Secretary of Energy, and Governor. I have negotiated with some of the toughest dictators in the world. But ask any kid in America: They want to be a fire fighter and it is easy to figure out why. It is because you are heroes. Maybe more importantly, it is because you keep your word. You keep your promise to protect. Folks in Washington could learn a thing or two from you."
Governor Richardson outlined the following details of his plan:
