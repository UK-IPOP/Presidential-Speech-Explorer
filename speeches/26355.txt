Secretary Udall, Senator Mansfield, Members of Congress, Commissioner Bennett, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen:
About 8 weeks ago I sent to the Congress a special message entitled "The Forgotten American."
It gives me a great deal of pride that this was the first special legislative message on the American Indian ever sent by a President to the Congress.
We are determined that the American Indian--the forgotten American--will be forgotten no more.
This afternoon we have met in the Cabinet Room to pay tribute to the Nation's largest Indian tribe, living in the largest Indian community: the Navajo Indian Tribe of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah.
The first items I sign this afternoon will be a law and a proclamation designating 1968 as the centennial year of this great tribe.
The President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House will very shortly appoint a Navajo Centennial Commission. I hope that this centennial will be a lively and pleasant and successful celebration. I can think of no better way for our citizens to join in the observance than to visit the American Southwest, the home of the Navajo people, to see firsthand their colorful history and culture.
Finally, I am signing a bill which frees $5,500,000 for spending by the State of Utah on health, education, and general welfare for the Navajo people there. Until now these funds could be spent only on roads and school tuition.
This moment is a good one for the Navajo people. I hope there will be more of them. I hope that in the days to come, I will be signing many laws to benefit all of America's Indian citizens--the first citizens among us.

Thank you.
