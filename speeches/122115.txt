For 70 years, the U.S. presence in the Asia-Pacific has been the foundation of regional peace, stability, and security in the region. Our presence has supported the stability and openness necessary for the unimpeded flow of resources and trade across Asia's waterways that has been critical to its unprecedented economic success. In the current environment, we are enabling our allies and partners to modernize their maritime capabilities in order to address the evolving dynamics of the region.

We are increasing the maritime security capacity of our allies and partners, to respond to threats in waters off their coasts and to provide maritime security more broadly across the region. We are not only focused on boosting capabilities, but also helping our partners develop the necessary infrastructure and logistical support, strengthen institutions, and enhance practical skills to develop sustainable and capable maritime forces.















The United States will remain engaged and committed to improving maritime security capabilities in Southeast Asia. We are working together with our allies and partners to develop the most effective mix of capabilities to provide credible maritime defenses and patrol capabilities. We will consult with our allies and partners to ascertain their needs and requirements more effectively and to explore new opportunities for maritime collaboration.
