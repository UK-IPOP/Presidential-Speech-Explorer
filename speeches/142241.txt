Pool Reports by 
, 
Greetings from Wilmington, where it's shaping up to be a pleasant day weather-wise.
We have a lunch lid until 1:30 pm. There's nothing currently on the president's public schedule for today, but I'll keep you posted on any updates.
On background from the White House:
Today, the President is in Wilmington, Delaware with no public schedule.
?Pool van was rolling as of 2:02 pm - no destination announced yet.
?As of about 2:20 pm, pool was holding near the president's residence.
Pool joined up with the presidential motorcade at approximately 4:10 pm after a security sweep. Rolling again.
Motorcade arrived at St. Joseph on the Brandywine at approximately 4:12 pm.
POTUS entered the church at approximately 4:13 pm. We're holding nearby.
POTUS left the church at about 5:06 pm. There did not appear to be any grandchildren accompanying him on the way out.
He did not respond to a shouted question about whether he was committed to working with Republicans on gun reform.
Several onlookers were on hand as he left - they appeared to be taking a pit stop from an exercise walk.
Several demonstrators were gathered near the church around the time the president arrived, but were gone by the time he left.
One of the earlier demonstrators' signs read "Joe Biden Equals Abortion Euthanasia and Infanticide."
"Puppets," one of them said before departing, apparently directing the remark toward the pool.
Pool van separated from the motorcade at approximately 5:14 pm. Your pooler was not able to see POTUS enter his residence.
We have a travel/photo lid. Have a great evening!
