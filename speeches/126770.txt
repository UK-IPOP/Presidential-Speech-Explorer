Marco: Donald Trump, Here's What Leadership Means

 






I know people are angry.  I know people are frustrated.  But leadership is not about making people even angrier and even more frustrated and asking them to give you power so you can go after another group that you want to blame for people's anger and frustration.

Real leadership is recognizing people are angry, recognizing people are frustrated, and then showing them a way forward that gives them hope and a belief that we can make things better. That's real leadership.
If I'm our nominee, no one's going to be asked, will you support the nominee if they're President? If I'm our nominee, we'll unite the party, we'll grow it, and we'll win.
