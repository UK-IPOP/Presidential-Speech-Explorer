 "Among the very few Republicans who voted for the largest tax increases in Michigan's history this week: two endorsers of ex-MA Gov. Mitt Romney. They are: State Sen. Valde Garcia, a member of Romney's mid-Michigan leadership team, and State Sen. Ron Jelinek, a member of Romney's West Michigan leadership team â€¦Michigan's 11.5 percent income tax hike and its sales tax extension will almost certainly be the subject of a question or two."
