STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Nov. 7, 1928.
I can make no adequate expression of gratitude for the overwhelming confidence of our people, who without regard to section or interest have selected me for President of the whole United States.
There has been a vindication of great issues and a determination of the true road of progress. The Republican Party has again been assessed with a great responsibility.
In this hour there can be for me no feeling of victory or exultation. Rather it imposes a sense of solemn responsibility of the future and of complete dependence upon divine guidance for the task which the greatest office in the world imposes.
That task is to give the best within me to interpret the common sense and the ideals of the American people.
I can only succeed in my part by the cooperation and unity of all leaders of opinion and of action for the common service of our country.
