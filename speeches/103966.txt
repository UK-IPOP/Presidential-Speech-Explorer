In July, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, an historic financial reform bill, and one consistent with the key priorities that he laid out a year ago. The bill puts the U.S. at the forefront of global financial reform and promotes a race to the top so that all international financial firms face the same tough standards everywhere on a level playing field. The U.S. is working closely with the European Union and others to ensure that the G-20's ambitious agenda for regulatory reform is implemented. Here in Seoul the G-20 reaffirmed that no firm should be too big or complicated to fail and taxpayers should not bear the cost of resolution; that all G-20 countries will put in place a strong national resolution regime that protects taxpayers; and that steps should be taken to ensure that large interconnected firms have a greater capacity to absorb losses.
