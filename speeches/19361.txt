MORE THAN a year ago a many-pronged effort was launched to underwrite the strength of American science and technology as one of our essential resources for national security and welfare. At that time I asked my Science Advisory Committee to make a study of ways in which the federal Government could best serve this objective.
The Committee has recently presented its report on "Strengthening American Science" to the Cabinet. I believe it is of such importance and timeliness that it should be given broad distribution.
One of the specific recommendations of the report calls for the establishment of a new federal Council for Science and Technology, a body to promote closer cooperation among federal agencies in planning their programs in science and technology. I have approved the establishment of this new Council and have asked that the appropriate Executive Order be prepared for bringing it into existence without delay. It is my hope that this new Council will improve the planning and management of Government research programs and will facilitate the resolution of common problems and promote greater interagency cooperation.
In making public this report, I call particular attention to the conclusion of the Science Advisory Committee that the task of further strengthening United States science is so broad that Government, industry, universities, foundations, and individuals all have essential roles to play. The future growth and strength of American science will depend upon the efforts of all of these parts of our national community if we are to rise to the demands of our times.
