The Clinton campaign today announced its Colorado Hispanic Leadership Council, made up of community leaders from across the state who will mobilize grassroots support for Hillary leading up to Colorado's February 5th caucus.
"Hispanics in Colorado know that Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to create the real change America needs," said State Senator Paula Sandoval. "She has been fighting for children and families and creating opportunities for every American," she added.
"I am very excited about receiving the support from these community leaders," said Hillary Clinton. "The Hispanic community will play a key role in the February 5th caucus, and I look forward to working with them to help put our country back on track."
