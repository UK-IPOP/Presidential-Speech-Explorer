[Released September 2, 1959. Dated August 31, 1959]
Dear General Franco:
Thank you for your cordial letter of August 24, 1959, delivered to me by your Foreign Minister, Mr. Fernando Maria Castiella, when he called on me in London on August 31.
I am of course pleased to know that you think well of the planned exchange of visits between Mr. Khrushchev and myself and that you clearly understand the basic thought that I have in mind in this connection.
I appreciate also your reference to the aid which we have extended to Spain in order to help our Spanish friends to assume certain responsibilities in defense of the west.
The agreements signed between our two countries in 1953 have produced good results for both of us. I am happy to have this opportunity to express to you my appreciation of the spirit of cooperation with which you have worked with us on the construction and operation of our joint bases. They are an important element in the common defense.
I should like also to congratulate you on the bold new economic program already auspiciously begun and on your membership in the OEEC. This constitutes another important link in forging the European unity to which you refer.
Your gracious invitation to Mrs. Eisenhower and me to visit your beautiful country so full of artistic treasures and historic landmarks is greatly appreciated. I hope that some day we shall have the opportunity to enjoy the friendly Spanish hospitality about which we have heard so much.
In the meantime, dear General, please accept my renewed thanks for your best wishes which are fully reciprocated.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
