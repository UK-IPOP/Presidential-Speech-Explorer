The President late today signed the joint resolution authorizing and directing the Federal Communications Commission to investigate and report on the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and on all other companies engaged directly or indirectly in telephone communication in interstate commerce, including all companies related to any of these companies through a holding company structure, or otherwise.
The resolution appropriates $750,000 to be made immediately available to the Federal Communications Commission for the purpose of the investigation.
This appropriation also would defray expenses of the special reports to Congress the commission is ordered to make as the investigation progresses and its findings are reached.
