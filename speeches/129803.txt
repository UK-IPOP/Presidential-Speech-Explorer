In response to the act of censoring the paid campaign ad by Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., Executive Director Michael S. Glassner reported the enormous online response to the ad through the following statement:

"The American people have fought back against CNN's censorship. We've received a tremendous response over the last 24 hours from people across the country viewing our ad online. We've broken through a media barricade and helped spread President Trump's message.

Between Facebook and YouTube alone, the ad highlighting the President's first 100 days in office has received over 1.5 million views. The ad even became the #6 trending video on YouTube yesterday. We couldn't be happier to see this type of response to CNN's boycott of our ad. It really shows that the American people will not sit idly by and let the mainstream media act as a puppet master."
