Mitt Romney today announced additional endorsements in Missouri. "Missouri will be a critical state in November," said Mitt Romney. "Whether our country continues down the same failed path of the last three years, or chooses a different, more prosperous course might well be decided by Missouri voters. I look forward to working with these leaders to defeat President Obama in Missouri and help put our country on a path to prosperity." Announcing his support, Speaker Steven Tilley said, "We have seen the results of having a president without experience working in the economy and they have not been good. Mitt Romney spent his life in the private sector and knows how economies grow and how jobs are created. Throughout his life, he has used conservative principles to turn around businesses, rescue the Olympics, and restore fiscal sanity in his state. I am honored to join his team with these outstanding leaders from Missouri. We will work hard to put him in the White House and put our country on the right track once again."
