In remarks on the War on Terror at the Port of Charleston, South Carolina, President Bush highlighted his commitment to protecting the homeland, including America's ports and increasing cargo security.
The President's FY 2005 budget requests resources for many important homeland security priorities. It includes a 9.7% increase in government-wide homeland security funding over FY 2004, nearly tripling the FY 2001 levels. It also includes a $3.6 billion (10%) overall increase over FY 2004 for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), doubling funding for DHS programs since FY 2001.
The President's budget demonstrated his commitment to port and cargo security. It includes:
The U.S. maritime transportation system is vital to the global economy. Over 95% of non-North American trade enters the country through U.S. seaports, and our seaports handle over $740 billion and 2 billion tons of domestic and international freight annually. Foreign vessels make 50,000 port calls annually.
Our seaports and maritime transportation infrastructure face a myriad of threats from the vessels, people, and cargo that move through them. Consistent with our approach to the overall War on Terrorism, our approach to seaport security calls for a layered defense that starts far beyond our mainland.
 The FY 2005 budget request includes a 9% (nearly $500 million) increase for the United States Coast Guard, bringing total Coast Guard funding to $6.3 billion (a 64% increase over FY 2001).
 The President's FY 2005 budget requests $450 million in new funding to maintain and enhance border security activities, including funding to expand pre-screening activities for cargo containers overseas, and for capabilities to better detect individuals attempting to illegally enter the United States. There are many important seaport and cargo security programs:
 The Department of Homeland Security's Port Security Grant Program provides resources for security planning and projects to improve dockside and perimeter security. In the last round of grant awards, some 442 projects in 326 locations from across the Nation received $179 million in funding. DHS also awarded an additional $245 million for port security in FY 2003. The President's FY 2005 budget provides $46 million for additional port security grants.
