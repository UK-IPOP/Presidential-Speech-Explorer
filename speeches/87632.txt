Hillary Clinton has significantly widened her lead in the Democratic primary from 11 points to 19, according to a new USA Today/Gallup poll released today. The poll was conducted at the same time that other candidates have launched announcement tours and received increased media attention.
Specifically the new poll shows:
"As other candidates are getting more and more attention, Hillary is getting more and more support," said Clinton chief strategist and pollster Mark Penn. "This poll confirms that Hillary not only can win but actually is today winning."
Today's poll comes on the heels of a Newsweek poll showing Hillary leading every Democratic and Republican contender she was matched up against, and a Fox News poll showing voters believe Hillary would be the toughest on terrorism of any presidential candidate from either party.
