Mr. Prime Minister, Mrs. Caramanlis, ladies and gentlemen:
It is a great pleasure for me to welcome you to the shores of the United States once again. Someone once said everyone is either an Athenian or a Spartan--in any case, we are all Greeks in the great sense of recognizing the wellspring from which all of our efforts began.
I am sure that sometimes the Greeks get tired of hearing about ancient history, because they are concerned with making history today. But we look to ancient Greece for inspiration, and .we look to modern Greece for comradeship.
And it is a source of pleasure to me today, as President, to welcome them, and also to recall that I was a Member of Congress in 1947 when President Truman put forward the Truman Doctrine. Congressman Hal leek who is now Minority Leader of the House was then I believe Majority Whip, and the Majority Leader at that time was Congressman Martin--one of the few occasions when Mr. Rayburn was not the Speaker--but they did indicate their strong support. While there were some questions in dispute in the 80th Congress, that was not one of them. But the immediate support which President Truman as the President received from Members of Congress on both sides--Republican and Democratic--indicates our awareness of the vital role that Greece has to play in the life of Europe, our common obligation to Greece and our common hope for the future.
So that I must say, on a day in which I believe we celebrate the birthday of the Foreign Minister--this first luncheon we have had at the White House where ladies have been permitted to be present, attended by distinguished citizens of my own country, many of whom are of Greek extraction, and all of whom are great citizens of this country and have been greatly interested in furthering good relations between the United States and Greece--it is a great pleasure to welcome you both here, and I ask you all to rise and drink with me a toast to the King of Greece.
