 What did you order, Mr. President?
 How you doing? Chicken quesadilla.
All right. Thanks, guys. Well done.
Mr. President, can we ask you a couple questions while we've got you here?
 If it's real quick.
Yes. The inflation report is out. Have you seen gas prices around here in L.A.? It's 7 bucks a gallon almost.
 Well, that's always been the case here. You know, it's not—what—nationwide, they came down about $1.35, and they're still down over a dollar.
But we're going to work on—housing is the big—is the most important thing we have to do in terms of that.
What is your message to Saudi Arabia about this?
 We're—"We're about to talk to you."
You're about to talk to——
 We're about to talk to them.
In what way, sir?
What are you going to say to them?
 Stay tuned.
Mr. President, do you plan to go to Nevada or Arizona or Georgia, some of these other States where there's competitive races in a few——
 Yes, I'm going to other races. I can't tell you how many, but I'm going to be on the road.
Thank you.
