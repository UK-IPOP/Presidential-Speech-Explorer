Ladies and gentlemen:
Immediately after the Senate action in a very close vote in not confirming Judge Haynsworth for the Supreme Court I called the Judge on the phone. I asked him if he would continue to serve as Chief Judge of the 4th Circuit.
The Judge at that time said he wanted to think about it. He felt that the primary consideration was whether the confirmation hearings and the refusal of the Senate to confirm him had impaired his ability to serve on that Court in an effective way, in the way that was justified.
I have discussed the matter with the Judge. We have had an exchange of correspondence and I have talked to him today.
I must say that after the brutally vicious and, in my opinion, unfair attack on his integrity, I would well understand why the Judge would retire to private life. A weak man would; a fearful man would. The Judge is not a weak man. He is a strong man.
I told him of my philosophy which is that a great philosophy is one that is never without defeat, but it is always without fear. The Judge has suffered a defeat, but he is without fear.
A man of his courage, his integrity, is needed on one of the highest courts of this land and I am very delighted to announce today that the Judge will continue to serve as Chief Judge of the 4th Circuit.
