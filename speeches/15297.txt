IT CERTAINLY is a very great pleasure for me as President of the United States to welcome you to the Capital of our country.
On behalf of the Government and the people of the United States, I bid you a most hearty welcome.
I think your visit will improve--if that is possible--the cordial relations that exist between our two great countries, and I hope that while you are here you will have a very enjoyable time.
I was most happy to hear that the King had recovered so promptly, so that you could make this trip. I remember with a great deal of pleasure the visit of the King and Queen while I was in the United States Senate. It happened to be my privilege to be presented to them when they held a reception at the British Embassy here.
I also had another very pleasant visit with the King on the Renown in Plymouth harbor, when I was on the way home from Potsdam. He had me on the Renown for luncheon, then he returned the call on the Augusta, and we had a most pleasant visit and conversation on world affairs as it affected Great Britain and the United States. I hope while you are here that you will get a chance to see a great many of our people. I am sincerely sorry that you can't go from one end of the country to the other as you did in Canada, and let everybody in the country have a chance to get acquainted with you, because Margaret tells me that whenever anyone becomes acquainted with you, they immediately fall in love with you.
She had a most pleasant visit in England, and I hope that we will be able to make you feel as happy as she was when she came back home from there.
