 – As part of "Building a Better America" week, today Senator John Edwards will discuss his plan to tackle student loan debt and make college more affordable. Edwards was the first in his family to go to college and is running for president so that all young people have the same opportunities that he has had. He believes every young person who is willing to work hard, should have the chance to go to college. At a community meeting in Ames, Iowa tonight, Edwards will outline his plan to make college more affordable for millions of students through a national College for Everyone program that will pay for one year of public college for students willing to take a part-time job. He will also discuss his plans for reforming student loans to eliminating bank subsidies, making applying for financial aid easier, and expanding access to college counselors.
"In America, every child should be able to go as far as her God-given talents and hard work will take her," said Edwards. "As the first in my family to go to college, I know that our system of public education should be our sturdiest ladder of opportunity.
"But while a college education has never been more important, hundreds of thousands of young people fail to attend college each year because they can't afford it. And for students who do go to college, the cost of tuition just keeps going up. On average, college students now graduate with $20,000 in loans. To build the better America we all believe in, we must find ways to make college more affordable. We've got to make sure that every qualified student has the opportunity to go to college and fulfill the American Dream."
The College for Everyone program is based on a proposal that Edwards first talked about in his 2004 presidential campaign. In the fall of 2005, Edwards helped start a College for Everyone pilot program at Greene Central High School in Snow Hill, North Carolina, a economically disadvantaged, rural community in eastern North Carolina. The projected college-going rate for Greene Central seniors has increased from 54 percent before the program started to 74 percent today.

College has never been more important. College graduates can expect to earn $1 million more over their lifetimes than high school graduates, and their children are almost twice as likely to attend college themselves. However, an estimated 200,000 college-qualified graduates fail to attend college each year. Students from high-income families are five times more likely to enroll in college than their low-income peers. Students who do go to college now leave with about $20,000 in debt. Last year, student debt rose by 8 percent while college graduates' starting wages grew by only 4 percent.

Today, John Edwards discussed his plan to tackle student loan debt and make college more affordable. He proposed a national College for Everyone initiative to pay public college tuition for students willing to take a part-time job. He will also reform student loans to eliminate bank subsidies, make applying for financial aid easier, and expand access to college counselors.
In the fall of 2005, John Edwards helped start a College for Everyone pilot program at Greene Central High School in Snow Hill, North Carolina. The program was launched by the Center for Promise and Opportunity Foundation, a North Carolina nonprofit organization. Located in rural, eastern North Carolina, Greene County's income and education attainment are lower than North Carolina averages. Its school system has an above-average percentage of students who are economically disadvantaged.
The College for Everyone program is based on a proposal that Edwards first talked about in his 2004 presidential campaign. It helps pay for the first year of tuition, fees and books for college students who agree to work part-time. Students must also complete coursework that prepares them for further education, stay out of trouble, and enroll in a participating public university or community college. The program works with College Summit and North Carolina's universities and community colleges. Last year the program announced that more than $300,000 in scholarship funding was available, and 72 students just completed their first year of college. More than 125 students from this year's graduating class were expected to college in the fall with the help of College for Everyone. The projected college-going rate for Greene Central seniors has increased from 54 percent before the program started to 74 percent today.
Today John Edwards proposed a series of initiatives to help all qualified students pay for college. His College Opportunity Agenda includes:
