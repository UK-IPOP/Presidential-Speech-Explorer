AS A FRIEND of Japan and the Republic of Korea, we welcome their exchange of instruments of ratification of the Treaty of Basic Relations and its associated agreements. We believe that this final step in the establishment of normal relations between these two neighbors will bring important and lasting benefit to both peoples, and will strengthen the community of free nations.
