Today, President Bush visited the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area in Thousand Oaks, California to highlight his agenda to care for our National Parks.
Since President Bush took office, he has committed nearly $2.9 billion towards reducing an estimated $4.9 billion maintenance backlog at National Parks. Under his leadership, approximately 900 maintenance backlog projects have been completed; 900 more are underway and planned.
On May 30, 2001, President Bush announced the National Parks Legacy Project to care for our National Parks for the enjoyment of future generations of Americans. The Legacy Project funds the infrastructure needs of our National Park System, establishes accountability through performance goals, and enhances the National Park experience.
