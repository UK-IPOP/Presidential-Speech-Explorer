[Released May 13, 1947. Dated May 12, 1947]
I THANK YOU for your courteous message sent me upon your departure from the United States.
The visit which you and your distinguished companions have graciously paid to me and to the people of the United States has strengthened the already firm ties of friendship and understanding between our two countries. I share your confidence that our relations will grow ever stronger in the same cordial spirit that governed my recent visit to your great country and your visit to the United States.
May I express to you, Mr. President, my best wishes for your personal well-being and happiness.
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[His Excellency Miguel Aleman, President of the Mexican States, Mexico D.F. (Mexico)]
