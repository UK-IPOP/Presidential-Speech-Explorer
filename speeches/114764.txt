Today, President Obama and Senior administration officials met with CEOs from across the health insurance industry to discuss ways to work together to help people enroll through the new Marketplaces as well as efforts to minimize disruption for consumers as they transition to new coverage.
The President said that the administration and insurers share the same goal: getting more Americans covered.
The discussion was productive - the insurance CEOs and administration officials discussed the next steps in working with states and state insurance commissioners to use the new flexibility the administration announced to address cancellation notices going to consumers. Meeting participants stressed the importance of working together to minimize disruption for consumers as well as the need to continue to reach consumers with clear information about their options and choices.
The President led a discussion with industry leaders about the best pathways for consumers to enroll in coverage. Administration officials are working closely with insurance companies on both consumer education as well as fixing the technical issues with healthcare.gov so that consumers can obtain the coverage they need.
