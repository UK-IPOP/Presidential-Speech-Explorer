Excerpts from the President's Remarks to be delivered on May 20, 2002:
The President announced today his Initiative for a New Cuba. This initiative, the result of a policy review conducted by the White House, is an effort to bring Cuba into the Western Hemisphere's community of democracies.
With reform, trade can benefit the Cuban people and allow them to share in the progress of our time. Without major reform, trade with Cuba will only help the Castro regime, not the Cuban people.
The United States has long maintained that the Cuban government must move to a democratic system that fully respects the human rights of its people. This will remain the Administration's policy.
The Initiative for a New Cuba reaches out to the Cuban people immediately with the following new steps to make life better for people living under Castro's rule:
The Initiative for a New Cuba also states that the United States is not a threat to Cuban sovereignty.
Under the Initiative for a New Cuba, the Administration will continue to work to mitigate the suffering of the Cuban people. This Initiative is the beginning of an ongoing, flexible, and responsive campaign designed to generate rapid and peaceful change within Cuba.
