Your Beatitude, members of the Government of Cyprus:
We want to express our very warm welcome to our distinguished visitor who comes from a most ancient country, representing a most ancient people, and also a young country. We salute him particularly because of the long and difficult fight he conducted for his country's independence, involving the most sensitive interests, involving his own persistent, courageous, and far-seeing view of his country's future. It is a particular source of satisfaction to me to welcome him here, because he spent some time in my own State of Massachusetts, both at the university there and also as a parish priest in one of our communities.
So we feel that you have come to a country which you know well and knows you. You are most welcome here. Your country occupies a most significant, strategic position in the world today. Your own efforts to maintain the independence and viability of your country are well known here, and you come to the United States with the warmest best wishes of all of our people who admire a courageous fighter for freedom.
Your Beatitude, we are honored to have you here in Washington.
