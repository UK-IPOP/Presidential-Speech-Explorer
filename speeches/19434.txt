THE SUPREME COURT, in its opinion rendered Monday, once again has spoken with unanimity on the matter of equality of opportunity for education in the nation's public schools. It is incumbent upon all Americans, public officials and private citizens alike, to recognize their duty of complying with the rulings of the highest court in the land. Any other course, as I have said before, would be fraught with grave consequences to our nation.
Americans have always been proud that their institutions rest on the concept of equal justice under law. We must never forget that the rights of all of us depend upon respect for the lawfully determined rights of each of us. As one nation, we must assure to all our people, whatever their color or creed, the enjoyment of their Constitutional rights and the full measure of the law's protection. We must be faithful to our Constitutional ideals and go forward in good faith with the unremitting task of translating them into reality.
