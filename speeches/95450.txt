 "Southern Arizona's representatives in Congress are split on how to break a deadlock over an economic stimulus proposal called for by President Bush. ... McCain, a Republican, criticized a part of the GOP-backed House bill that would repeal the corporate alternative minimum tax and refund 15 years' worth of revenue collected from major corporations under that law."

 "'The House bill would give billions of dollars in tax money to big corporations' without creating much benefit for the economy, McCain said. 'No one believes that if Ford Motor Co. received a $1 billion check from the federal government that they'd spend it immediately.'" (Joe Salkowski, "Stimulus Splits Area Lawmakers," [Tucson]

 "What about putting money directly in the hands of consumers, something some economists and Democratic candidates are proposing? 'Don't go for any gimmicks like a rebate or subsidies to people. They don't need subsidies. They need lower taxes on the factors of production,' [McCain adviser Jack] Kemp says." (Alex Frangos, "Jack Kemp Previews McCain-onomics,"

 "'A good package would be one that gives relief to low- and middle- income taxpayers, one that extends unemployment and health-care benefits to the unemployed and offers some tax breaks that would take effect quickly,' [Sen. McCain] said." (Joe Salkowski, "Stimulus Splits Area Lawmakers," [Tucson]
