THE PRESIDENT received a courtesy visit from Greek Deputy Premiers Constantine Tsaldaris and Sophocles Venizelos at noon today.
Messrs. Tsaldaris and Venizelos, who head their country's delegation to the General Assembly and are the leaders of the two principal parties in the Greek Coalition Government, called to pay their respects to the President before returning to Greece.
The President took this occasion to congratulate the Greek leaders on the victories won by the Greek national forces--victories which have reduced the Communist guerrilla movement to police proportions. He expressed the hope that this would make possible the early restoration of normal peacetime conditions in Greece and rapid reconstruction of the Greek economy. The President also assured his callers of the continued interest of the United States in the welfare and security of the Greek people.
