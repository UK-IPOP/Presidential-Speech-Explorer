Chapel Hill, North Carolina – Today, the Edwards campaign unveiled a new grassroots web site—
. The new site will offer a one-stop shop for all Americans interested in growing the Hillary plant movement.
As part of the 
 web site, potential plants can listen to testimonials from past plants, read the "Top 10 Questions Plants Should Never Ask Hillary," learn how to recognize other plants at Senator Clinton's events, submit suggestions for planted questions, and purchase the soon to be released "Questions are hard...so plant them" t-shirt.
The site also features a new YouTube video—"Politics of Planting"—which highlights Senator Clinton's evolution from parsing answers to answering planted questions.
