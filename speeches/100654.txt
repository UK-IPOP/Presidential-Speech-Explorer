 Mr. President, we know this is one of the most storied rivalries in all of sports. What does the Army-Navy game mean to you?
 Well, it means to me that I haveâ€”I got a chance to come and be with people who will be joining the finest military in the history of the world.
 When you look at these young players and the seniors, and you know that they enrolled in the academies after 9/11, what does that say about them?
 I stand in awe of somebody who would volunteer to serve America in a time of danger. It says that we are blessed to have people of such character in our country.
 Mr. President, I know you're probably doing a lot of reflecting here on December 6. What will you miss the most about being President?
 I will miss a lot of things. But one of the things I have treasured the most is to be the Commander in Chief of men and women of courage and character and decency.
 Thank you, Mr. President.
