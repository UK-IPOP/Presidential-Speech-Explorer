 Is it hot enough? [

Just slightly.
 Anyway, I think it was a good day. We're going to get a lot done down in Kentucky. I think they're going to be able to be in good shape. And the Governor is really working. There's a real bipartisan effort down there, so I'm very hopeful. Very hopeful.
Do you think people are listening to your bipartisan message, which you keep repeating? You were saying it today.
 Well, I—you know——
Are Americans listening? Because you are—I'm sorry to say that you're—in the polls—with due respect, in the polls, you're very—you know, your polls are terrible. But your message seems to be reaching out to people. Why aren't they hearing it?
 Well, it's a long way home. You know, it's—the fact is that we've been divided for so long, and it's only recently that we have any kind of a movement. And I think you're going to see a lot change.
Did you invite Leader McConnell on this trip today?
 I talked to him. I—he knew——
Did you invite him today?
 I—he knows he's always invited. I invited him the first time I went down.
Do you wish he would have joined you?
 No, I don't think so. I don't think he has to. He's got a—he's got a Senate to run.
What was your message to the—what was your message to the families and the flood victims whose homes were damaged? When you were talking with them, what was your message to them?
 My message was: We're going to stay until they're fixed.
Thanks.
Thank you, Mr. President.
