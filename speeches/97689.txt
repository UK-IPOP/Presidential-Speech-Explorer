ARLINGTON, VA -- Today, McCain-Palin 2008 campaign spokesman Ben Porritt released the following statement:
"Given his deep and longstanding ties to ACORN, Barack Obama must immediately come clean with the American people about his relationship with the left-wing, activist organization. Already under investigation for voter fraud in 14 states, ACORN's illegal activities threaten to undermine the integrity of our democratic process. Barack Obama's association with ACORN demonstrates stunningly bad judgment and troubling blind ambition."
 
 "What's more, Obama worked as executive director of ACORN's voter-registration arm, Project Vote, in 1992." (Editorial, "Is ACORN Stealing The Election?"

 "The latest wave of ACORN investigations has provided Republicans with both an opening to assail an old foe, and a new line of criticism to use against the Democratic presidential nominee, who represented ACORN in a lawsuit in the 1990s." (Alexander Burns, "ACORN Gives GOP New Line Of Attack,"
