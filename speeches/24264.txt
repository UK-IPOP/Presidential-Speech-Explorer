THE PEACE CORPS' school-to-school program deserves the attention and support of every American.
It is a program unique in Government because it allows individuals--particularly American youth--to directly participate in solving a major world problem at its most meaningful level--on a people-to-people basis.
Already young American students have raised funds to construct 150 such schools in rural areas in 24 countries, and another 300 groups are currently raising funds to continue the program. The goal for this fiscal year, 1967, is 1,000 schools.
In a world where four out of ten persons still cannot read or write, such schools may well be the most important structures along the road to peace.
