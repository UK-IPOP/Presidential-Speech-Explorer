The Administration strongly opposes enactment of H.R. 2237 unless it is amended to:


— reduce the excessive authorization levels contained in section 2(a) for the NHSC field program from $225 million to $161 million, the Concurrent Budget Resolution level, for the period 1986-88, and

— delete section 8, which unjustifiably authorizes $1.5 million for technical assistance to States for data collection and information gathering activities.
The President's senior advisors would recommend disapproval of this bill in its present form.
