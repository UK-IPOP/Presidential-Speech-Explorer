President Biden's climate vision and leadership is spurring unprecedented economic investments in American-made clean energy. In recent weeks, the President has taken bold and decisive action to accelerate solar energy in the U.S., make charging an electric vehicle more affordable and accessible, and lower energy costs for American families through more efficient home heating equipment.
Building on these actions, on Thursday the President brought together a bipartisan group of Governors and senior officials from 11 East Coast states to launch a new

Biden administration officials met with state governors and labor leaders at the White House on Thursday. 
 . . . The wind initiative will provide funding to create a domestic offshore wind supply chain and support a fleet of specialized vessels to build and service the projects, the White House said.
"I'm thrilled to see the Biden Administration team up with governors across the East Coast, including Delaware, to boost offshore wind. This partnership will reduce emissions, lower energy costs, and create good-paying jobs—a win-win-win." [

 "The IBEW's 775,000 members applaud the Biden Administration for convening this first-of-its-kind collaboration between federal and state officials to accelerate offshore wind deployment. With the input of key stakeholders, including the IBEW, the partnership will help to ensure that the offshore wind industry fosters a strong, U.S.-based supply chain for offshore wind, grows a skilled U.S. workforce supported by good union jobs, builds on the administration's work to address important issues like electrical transmission and building a domestic fleet of Jones Act-compliant Wind Turbine Installation Vessels (WTIVs), and other key priorities."

"GE is proud to provide turbines for Vineyard Wind, the first commercial offshore wind farm in America, which will help create more than 500 union jobs. We applaud the Biden Administration's continued focus on growing opportunities in offshore wind and look forward to continuing our work with the Administration and coastal governors to establish a much-needed offshore wind supply chain to promote domestic energy and American manufacturing and jobs."
"President Biden is showing real leadership in developing clean energy for America. The creation of a Federal-State Offshore Wind Partnership is exactly what our nation needs to create a booming offshore wind industry that will employ many thousands of Americans in new union jobs. Today, I was honored to join senior members of the Biden Administration, governors from across the east coast, and my colleagues in industry and labor at the White House. The discussion about the steps we can take to build out this new industry even faster and bigger left me energized and excited about the prospects for clean American energy." [

"This new partnership will help propel the growing offshore wind industry in the United States by helping to create good-paying American jobs, expanding access to clean and affordable energy to more homes and creating predictability for the industry. The development of offshore wind is critical to meeting our nation's climate targets and building our clean energy economy, and we support the administration's initiative to bring important stakeholders to the table to invest in the infrastructure and domestic supply chain the industry needs. Clear and predictable permitting for offshore wind is essential to recognizing its potential and there is still work to do. We look forward to working with the administration as this partnership continues its important work to support this critical industry and our clean energy transition." [

These types of collaboration, coordination, and actions are exactly what are needed to support offshore wind. This new industry has so much potential but will require public and private support to ensure it gets off the ground, and in the water. As a company working to supply more than 2 million homes with offshore wind power we commend the Administration and state-level support in moving offshore wind forward." [

"This is exactly the kind of regional coordination we need to scale up the offshore wind in a smart way. Building a robust and responsibly sited offshore wind industry will bring us closer to meeting our ambitious clean energy goals, boost the economy, create good union jobs, and contribute to protecting the ocean from the worst effects of climate change." [

"We applaud President Biden's leadership to advance domestic clean energy. Offshore wind has the potential to be a game-changer in the U.S. energy portfolio, making energy prices cheaper, creating jobs, and replacing the fossil fuels that are driving climate change. Our oceans also need strong safeguards for marine life to avoid, minimize, and mitigate the impacts of offshore wind projects. Today, there are just 7 offshore wind turbines in the United States and we're going to need a lot more, done responsibly, to meet our clean energy goals. We're glad to see the Biden-Harris administration's efforts to advance responsible, just, equitable solutions to mitigate the dangerous and costly effects of climate change." [Statement, 6/23/22]
"The offshore wind industry is taking off along our shores, providing the opportunity to create high-quality, union jobs building, operating, and maintaining a growing number of offshore wind farms. To fully seize on the economic and climate opportunities inherent in this sector, we need to invest in building crucial supply chains. We welcome this announcement and will continue to work with the administration and within the states to ensure that our workers and communities reap the maximum benefits from this growing industry."
