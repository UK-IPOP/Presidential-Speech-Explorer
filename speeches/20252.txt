Your Excellency:
Your message was most gratifying. It is good to know that the strong desire of the American people and its government to do their utmost to bring an end to fighting and to reach a peaceful settlement is so fully appreciated by the government and people of Thailand. I am also encouraged by the knowledge that the people of our two countries share the same opinion on these world problems.

Sincerely yours,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
