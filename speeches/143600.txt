Pool Reports by 
, 
Good afternoon. We're at Audi Field this afternoon, where the VP just recently arrived for a surprise attendance and coin flip for the Howard/Hampton University game. Pool just went onto the field and coin flip will occur shortly.
I believe this is the first-ever college football game to be hosted at Audi Field.
VP took the field at 12:01pm to cheers from the crowd. The Howard football team flanked the entrance to the field. She did the coin toss at 12:03pm and exited the field to more cheers. (Hard to hear what the coin toss result was, but will try to find out. I'm told it was tails, but not 100% confirmed).
SGOTUS is also here and the two will be staying to watch the game. (Pool will not be).
Pool exited the VP soon after and that's all from me! Enjoy your Saturday, please reach out with any questions.
After listening to my video, it appears that Hampton called tails and the result was heads. (Howard won the toss and deferred). Ping me if you'd like the video, can pass it along.
Have a good weekend!
