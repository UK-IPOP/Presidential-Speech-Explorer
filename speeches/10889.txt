AT THE MOMENT of Your Majesties' departure from the United States, I wish to express to Your Majesty and to Queen Rambai Barni my pleasure and that of Mrs. Hoover that Your Majesties chose to visit this country and that you gave us the pleasure of your visit to Washington. I wish you a most enjoyable and safe journey homeward and long years of usefulness as ruler of your happy and prosperous country. Mrs. Hoover joins me in thanking Your Majesties for the kind message which has just been received from you. I am certain that the American people will rejoice with me in learning that you have enjoyed your residence here and that your health has been benefited.
