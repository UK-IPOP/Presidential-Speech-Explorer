 Happy Halloween, everybody!

. Happy Halloween!

. Trick or treat.

. Trick or treat.

. The—well, it is great to see all of you guys. Your costumes are outstanding. Young man, no selfies in the middle of me talking. [
] The—and, Darth Vader, back up a little bit. I'm getting spooked. [
]

The—so we just want to say to all the families, all the kids, it is great to see you guys. We hope you have a great time today. You guys all look scary or cool or whatever you're trying to be. [
] Awesome. Many of you look awesome. And we hope you have a great time. We hope, parents, that on this day, at least, you don't have to pay attention to Michelle and healthy eating. [
]

 Candy for everybody.

. Yay!

 And in fact, the more candy, the later you eat the candy, the better. [
] Because I think that you being up all night with a sugar rush is exactly what your parents are looking for. [
]

All right? So we hope you guys have a great time. And to the staff who are here, thank you, guys. I'm glad you guys took a little break from all the outstanding work.

And now, my understanding is, is that we've been working on a little dance. We don't know how it's going to go, but we think we should all just try it anyway. What do you think?

 Yes!

 Yes, don't you think?

. I want to see what you guys have done.

. All right. So who's got the music? Let's cue it up. Everybody, get ready.
