[ Released April 18, 1965. Dated April 17, 1965 ]

Dear Mr. Secretary:
I have your letter of March 26 responding to the Civil Rights Commission Report discussing a number of Department of Agriculture programs and the manner in which they have been operated. The Commission report pointed out some instances in which discrimination on the basis of race have been found to exist.
It seems to me that the steps the Department is taking are designed to correct these deficiencies. I note, however, that many of them depend upon reports and responses from various units of the Department, and I would appreciate it, therefore, if you could let me know what actual progress has been made as a result of the changes you have instituted. It seems to me that a report 60 days from now on the progress actually made would be helpful.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Honorable Orville Freeman, The Secretary, Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C.]
