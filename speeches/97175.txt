 A modernized FHA that is granted appropriate pricing flexibility and freed from the millstone of risky loans resulting from opportunistic ventures posing as charities could help thousands of additional homeowners by the end of this year, and passage of this bill is the appropriate next step to help bring stability to the housing market for years to come.

 President Bush calls on Congress to bring legislation to implement the Colombia agreement to the floor for approval and to send this legislation to the President's desk to be signed into law. This agreement is too important to be delayed any longer.
