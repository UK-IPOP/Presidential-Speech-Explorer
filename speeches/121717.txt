Enjoy lunch on us while you have an open discussion with Governor Pataki about his plans for the future of America!
The Governor will be "brown bagging" it all across New Hampshire this summer and he's coming to you!
Just tell us where you'd like him to be, gather a few friends and lunch is on us!

Stay in the Loop about future picnics and other New Hampshire events,
