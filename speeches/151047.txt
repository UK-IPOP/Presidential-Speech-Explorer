, 
Good morning from Washington, D.C. I'll be your print pooler today.
The president is headed to Lanham, Maryland, later to deliver remarks on his plan to reduce the deficit. The White House has called a lunch lid until 1 p.m. Please feel free to reach out with any questions.
Here's a look at today's schedule.
Pool has loaded into the vans on the South Lawn driveway as we wait for POTUS for the half-hour ride to the IBEW Local Union 26 in Lanham, Maryland.
The president's remarks (scheduled for 2:30 pm ET) will be livestreamed here: 
One clarification on the schedule: there is no press briefing scheduled for today.
POTUS stepped out of the Oval Office at 1:47 pm ET. He climbed into the Beast a minute later and the motorcade is now rolling at 1:49 pm ET.

The motorcade arrived at 2:11pm ET after an uneventful ride.
Pool was escorted inside the IBEW Local Union 26 to a hall at the end of the building. The president's podium is set against a backdrop of stairs lined with local union members holding handmade signs that read "Let's go Joe!" and "IBEW + Biden â€“ Perfect Union." Five American flags and three bunting flags were also displayed along the stairs. The crowd cheered as Gov. Wes Moore entered the hall.

The President
POTUS took the stage at 2:33 pm ET and began speaking after briefly turning to look at all the poster signs behind him.
I won't be sending quotes but will send any notable color from the room.
POTUS finished speaking at 3:07 pm ET for a total of 34 minutes. He stepped off the stage and into the crowd to work the rope line for several minutes.
The crowd erupted into cheers several times throughout his speech as he touched on his economic plan, funding high-speed internet and electric vehicle charging stations through the bipartisan infrastructure law, bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. and lowering the cost of prescription drugs.
He repeated his promise to veto any legislation that cuts Social Security and Medicare. "That's the Republican dream. I'm their nightmare," he said.
Pool is moving back to the vans.
The motorcade is rolling at 3:29pm ET.
Pool did not see POTUS join the motorcade before we moved.
The motorcade arrived back at the White House at 3:50pm ET.
The Beast stopped in front of the residence, but pool did not see POTUS exit.
We have a lid. Have a wonderful afternoon!
