 "In a sweeping broadside against Obama's economic policies, Romney told delegates in Tampa that the president's promises 'gave way to disappointment and division;' that families and businesses expected to be doing better by now; college graduates 'thought they'd have a good job by now, a place of their own ...' and the nation expected by now to be 'paying down the national debt and rolling back those massive deficits.'"

 "Romney's best moment (to our mind) was when he talked wistfully (and emotionally) about missing the joys of raising kids â€” a genuinely human moment that almost anyone, no matter their party registration, could relate to. Romney also did well in casting himself as the anti-Obama. Where Obama lacked business experience, Romney has it in spades. Where Obama made sweeping promises, Romney made simple ones. (The most quoted line of the speech will almost certainly be this one: 'President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and heal the planet. My promise...is to help you and your family.')" (

 "Mitt Romney accepted the Republican nomination for president with a speech on Thursday night that not only laid out his personal history and his ticket's policies, but threw down the gauntlet against President Barack Obama." (
