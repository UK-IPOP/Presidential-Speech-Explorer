I am not a stranger here because for a good many years I used to come down here. I have not been here for seven years, but I am coming back, for I have firmly resolved not to make this the last time.
I have had a very wonderful twelve days' fishing in these Florida and Bahama waters. It has been a splendid rest and we have caught a great many fish, but I am not going to attempt to tell you any fishing stories. The only fly in the ointment on my trip has been that I have put on about ten pounds so that means that among the other duties that I shall have to perform when I get North is taking those ten pounds off.
I hope very much to be able to come down here next winter, and to see all of you, and to have another enjoyable ten days or two weeks in Florida waters.
Many thanks.
