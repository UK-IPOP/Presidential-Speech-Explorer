PASSAGE of the Foreign Assistance Appropriation Act by the House of Representatives, coming so swiftly after the authorization bill enacted last week, reflects a welcome and healthy understanding between the executive and legislative branches on this important program at a critical moment in history.
The bill passed by the House provides the smallest reduction ever made below the administration's original authorization request. It is $175 million below the request I submitted early this year, and $75 million below the appropriation request.
I commend the Members of the House for the prudence and promptness of their action today. It is heartening news to those here and abroad who look to this program for help in liberating men from tragic want, disease, and oppression.
