The expansion is a joint Department of State-Department of Defense mission that will employ both civilian and military resources toward a common strategic plan.
 Through these new relationships, provincial leaders are able to voice their concerns and obtain approvals for critical essential services projects. This process helps them develop greater self-reliance and increases their capacity to govern.
