The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that between 2002 and 2012, the U.S. will need approximately one million skilled workers to fill construction jobs. These jobs pay well, are in demand, require a high skill level, and offer workers a stable future. The President believes that skilled trades will play a significant role in building America's future, and the United States has the skills and talent to fill the growing number of jobs available in the construction industry.
President Bush's initiatives in secondary education and job training are working to strengthen workers' abilities to get jobs in many high-paying, high-growth industries - including the skilled trades. The President believes the skilled trades are and will continue to be an important driver of job growth in America, and the Federal government can help ensure access to the skills workers need to fill those jobs - through job training partnerships between industries and community colleges, and strengthening education.
