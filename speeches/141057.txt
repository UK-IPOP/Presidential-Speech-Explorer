Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. today 
 suit against the Philadelphia County Board of Elections in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County challenging the Democrat election officials' illegal refusal to allow watchers at its early voting sites and their total disregard for the election integrity principles of transparency and accountability. The Campaign's lawsuit demands that the Board of Elections allow watchers to do their jobs in Philadelphia's voting centers, provide watcher certifications, and allow watchers to remain in the public areas of voting centers during all open hours.

"Bad things are happening in Philadelphia. While transparency and accountability are hallmarks of election integrity, the actions of Philadelphia election officials to date have undermined election integrity by shrouding the casting of ballots in secrecy," 
. "The absence of poll watchers at polling places where registration and voting are occurring threatens the integrity of the vote in elections and denies voters the constitutional right to free and fair public elections under the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions."

: "President Trump is taking the fight for a fair, transparent election to Philadelphia's Democrat election officials, who would apparently prefer to check transparency and accountability at the door. These Democrat officials have repeatedly denied Trump Campaign observers access to several voting locations across the city in violation of state law. The Trump Campaign—and any campaign—has a statutory right to have watchers observe the voting process and ensure voting sites are being run properly and all rules are applied equally. What are these officials hiding? We will not stand by while Democrats skirt the rules and illegally hide the voting process from the public."
