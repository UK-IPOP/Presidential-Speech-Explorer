 The President has directed these agencies to take the first steps toward regulations that would cut gasoline consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles, using as a starting point his "Twenty in Ten" plan to reduce U.S. gasoline consumption by 20 percent over the next 10 years.
 The Administration will redouble its efforts to work with Congress on a bipartisan "Twenty in Ten" bill.
 We have now reached a pivotal moment where advances in technology are creating new ways to improve energy security, strengthen national security, and protect the environment. The President's "Twenty in Ten" goal will help achieve all these priorities.
 The President has requested an additional $7.4 billion for FY 2008 â€“ $205 million more than this year. This amount would support a wide range of climate change-related research, development, and deployment programs, voluntary partnerships, and international aid efforts.
 The two actions cumulatively raised light truck fuel economy standards from 20.7 mpg prior to 2005, to 24 mpg in 2011. These actions are expected to save 14 billion gallons of fuel over the life of the affected vehicles, and reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by 107 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.
 U.S. greenhouse gas intensity declined by 2.5 percent in 2005, much faster than the average decline of 1.9 percent over the 1990-2005 period.
