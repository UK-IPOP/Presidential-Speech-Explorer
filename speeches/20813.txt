TO YOU who have gathered today in Miami, I send greetings. You have personally encountered the sorrow and pain which accompany the fight for freedom.
The mothers and fathers who in every generation have seen their sons fight for freedom have understood and lived through this grief.
But today, I send you a message of hope. The American people will never forget the people of Cuba--the American people will always associate themselves with your fight for freedom. And freedom will come--for tyranny can never in the long run overcome the legitimate ambitions of people to be free.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
