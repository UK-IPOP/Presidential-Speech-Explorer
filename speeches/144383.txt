Good Afternoon,
It's partly cloudy evening in Berlin (72°F) and sunny (90°F), humid early afternoon in Washington. I am Marek Walkuski from Polish Radio. It's my pleasure to be your foreign pooler for German Chancellor Angela Merkel's visit to the White House. As we wait for the arrival I would like to share some background information that you may find useful.
Angela Merkel arrived in Washington yesterday evening and spend the night at a hotel in Georgetown. Today at 9:00 AM she joined vice president Kamala Harris for a working breakfast at the VP's residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory. After a meeting with business leaders, the Chancellor was presented with a honorary degree at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Following the ceremony, Merkel delivered remarks and answered questions submitted by JHU students.
Angela Merkel will arrive at the White House around 1:55 PM. After meeting with POTUS at the Oval Office at 2:00 PM and an expanded bilateral-meeting at 2:25 PM, both leaders will hold a press conference at 4:15 PM in the East Room. At 6:15 PM the President and the First lady will host Dr. Merkel and her husband Professor Joachim Sauer for a dinner. Other guests include VP Kamala Harris, the First Gentleman and a group of "supporters of the bilateral relationship with Germany", per the White House.
As Chancellor Merkel visits Washington more than 40 people have died and dozens are missing in deadly floods in Germany and Belgium. Chancellor Merkel expressed shock and sorrow and assured that everything possible will be done to find those who are still missing.
After leaders of Japan, South Korea, Israel and Afghanistan, Angela Merkel will be the fifth foreign official and the first European leader to visit the White House since Joe Biden's inauguration. Today's visit will be Angela Merkel's final trip to Washington as a Chancellor before she steps down from her post in September following the German federal election. During her sixteen-year tenure Merkel visited the United States at least 19 times, including 11 visits to the White House, per Office of the Historian at the Department of State.
Chancellor Merkel have had a chilly relationship with former President Donald Trump, who publicly criticized Germany for what he considered unfair trade practices, open borders and insufficient defense spending. He repeatedly accused Germany and the European Union of exploiting the United States and in 2020 announced partial U.S. troops withdrawal from Germany.
After four years of strain relations with Washington, German political establishment welcomed Joe Biden's presidency calling the trans-Atlantic alliance "irreplaceable" and declaring their willingness to open "a new chapter in the U.S. – German relations". Soon after assuming the office President Biden told Merkel that he wanted to revitalize the alliance with Germany. He quickly reversed his predecessor's decision on troops withdrawal and ended some trade disputes with the EU. Biden also waived sanctions against company overseeing the Nord Stream 2 and it's CEO, essentially letting the project to continue. He justified his decision by pointing to the fact that the pipeline has been 90% completed and expressed hid belief that imposing sanctions would be "counter-productive" foe U.S. European relations. This decision however upset leaders in Ukraine, Poland and other Eastern European countries, who fear that Russia will use energy as a weapon and are concerned that the Berlin–oriented U.S policy in Europe will be conducted at the expense of NATO's eastern flank.
Joe Biden's electoral win has led to a significant shift in America's image in Germany. According to the Pew Research Center, the U.S. favorability among Germans rose from 26% to 59%. Majority now believe that the United States takes into account interests of their country when making foreign policy decisions (32% increase), and almost three in four see the United States as a reliable partner. In the Pew's 2021 Global Attitudes Survey President Joe Biden enjoys positive ratings from 78% of Germans - slightly lower than Barack Obama but significantly higher than Donald Trump (in 2020 only 10% of Germans had confidence in Trump to do the right thing in world affairs). More than 80% of surveyed approved Joe Biden's decision to rejoin WHO and the Paris Climate Agreement. This policy alignment may not be the case regarding relations with China. In a poll for German newspaper Die Weld in December only 17% of Germans supported siding with the U.S. in a potential conflict with China, 77% preferred not to get involved.
Chancellor Merkel arrived in a black SUV at the West Wing doors at 2:12 pm. She was greeted by the Acting Chief of Protocol of the United States Asel Roberts. Before the arrival a full honor military corridor lined up on both sides of the driveway, with 56 flags representing all U.S. states and territories. The pool has gathered at the James Brady briefing Room before the Oval Office meeting.
T
"The message is harmony" – that's how German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle described Angela Merkel's visit to the White House. Both leaders expressed their willingness to repair and strengthen bilateral and transatlantic relations. But even with the willingness on both sides to bridge the divisions and cooperate, there are differences between both governments on several issues, including relations with China, waving patent rights for the coronavirus vaccines and U.S. pandemic restrictions for travelers from the European Union. The Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline has been the most contentious issue in U.S.-German relations recently.
N
Despite waving sanctions on Nord Steram2 AG and it's CEO Matthias Warnig the Biden administration continues voicing opposition to the pipeline. Secretary of state Anthony Blinken said that Washington was working with Germany to mitigate adverse effects of Nord Stream 2. After the meeting with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday in Berlin, Angela Merkel declared that Ukraine will remain gas-transit country even when Nord Stream 2 is complete. At the same time she lowered expectations before her visit to the White House saying that she doubts the dispute over the pipeline will be fully resolved at a meeting with President Biden. The high ranking Biden administration official also said that while the issue will be discussed, the White House is not anticipating any formal announcement or deliverable on Nord Stream 2 coming out of the leaders meeting.
When the pool entered the Oval Office at 2:27 pm, President Biden and Chancellor Merkel were seated by the fireplace about 4-5 feet aparat.
After President Biden's welcoming remarks, the Chancellor thanked him for the invitation. She recalled their meetings at G7 and at the NATO summits. „We have now an opportunity to talk more about our bilateral relationship (…), relationship between Germany and America, obviously always in the context of European matters. We can also talk about matters that relate to immediate neighbors" - Merkel said in German through an English interpreter. The President and the Chancellor did not respond to shouted questions.
As always check your pooler's notes against the official transcript.

Full Chancellor Merkel's quote from the Oval Office:
„Well, thank you Mr. President, thank you very much for the invitation. I'm delighted to be here, we met at the g7 also at the NATO meeting, and now we have an opportunity to talk more about our bilateral relationship, relationship between Germany and America, obviously always in the context of European matters. We can also talk about matters that relate to immediate neighbors, geopolitical issues.
I'd like to say here how much I value friendship with the United States of America. We are more than aware of the contribution of America to a free and democratic Germany. So I am very much looking forward to deepening our relations yet again".
As my colleague Hans Nichols of Axios pointed out, when we were leaving the Oval Office a German reporter asked Biden when he would visit Germany. "Soon, I hope" - the President responded smiling.
