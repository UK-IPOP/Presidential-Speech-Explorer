THIS SUMMER more than 500,000 children from low-income families will be enrolled in Project Head Start Child Development Centers throughout the United States. More than 2,000 communities will join in giving these children a better chance to succeed when they start to school next fall. Tens of thousands of Americans are giving unselfishly of their time and skills to this nationwide war on poverty. Their dedication is the best proof we have that this war will be won.
Mrs. Johnson is Honorary Chairman of Project Head Start. On June 30, Sargent Shriver, Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity, will present her with the insignia of Head Start. On that day, in all the communities with a Head Start project, the local officials will raise a similar flag. It will serve as a symbol of hope to the thousands of families whose children will take part in Head Start.
Mrs. Johnson and I are proud of the Nation's response to Head Start. I want to call on all Americans to join with us in declaring Wednesday, June 30, Head Start Day, and to give wholehearted support to this vital undertaking.
