MR. AMBASSADOR, I am very happy that this ceremony has taken place today, because it is our theory always that wherever it is possible, we don't want to see any people go hungry.
We have been watching the situation in your country ever since we heard that your crops were short over there, and the arrangement of this loan and the signing of these documents makes us just as happy as I am sure it will make those people happy who would otherwise have gone hungry.

It is a pleasure to do that in this case.
