IT IS a pleasure to greet you. It seems that the young ladies win their prizes at an earlier date than the young men--18 against 17, if I am not mistaken.
But you are to be congratulated on what you have done. It is a contribution to the welfare of the country, and highly appreciated by me.
I think this is the fourth time, if I am not mistaken, that you are having a meeting on this very same subject and for this very same reason, and I hope you will continue in your careers and keep on putting out this information for which you won these prizes.
