THIS is a happy moment not only for me but for the American people. By closing loopholes which permitted pesticides to be sold before they were fully tested, this bill safeguards the health and the lives of all of our fellow Americans.
I am sorry that one voice which spoke so often and so eloquently for measures like this--the voice of Rachel Carson--is still today. She would have been proud of this bill and of this moment. We owe much to her and to those who still work for the cause of a safer and healthier America--Senator Ribicoff, Congressman Rosenthal, the Members of the Senate and House Agriculture Committees, the Distinguished Secretary of Agriculture, Mr. Freeman--all who initiated and worked and supported this legislation through the Congress.
Our concern must always be the health of every one of our fellow Americans. We are taking another step in that direction today, and I am proud to sign this bill in the presence of the distinguished Speaker and the Majority Leader and other able Members of the Congress.
