[ Released August 20, 1952. Dated August 13, 1952 ]
Dear Captain Ewing:
I read with great interest your observations on your interviews with prisoners of war in Korea. Your conversations with those men who prefer death to life under a communist regime point up vividly the compelling humanitarian and moral reasons for the stand which the United Nations negotiators have taken on the repatriation question. We must not use bayonets to force these prisoners to return to slavery and almost certain death at the hands of the communists.
You soldiers in Korea can also well appreciate the fact that behind the Iron Curtain there are millions of people who yearn desperately to regain their lost freedom and sense of dignity. These people look to the free world as their only hope to achieve this goal. This fact applies with special force to those hundreds of thousands of Chinese and North Koreans who have been impressed into the communist armies and forced to face suffering and death to further the brutal ends of aggression.

Thank you for writing.

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN

[Captain Charles G. Ewing, 704th CIC Detachment, APO 59, c/o Postmaster, San Francisco, California]
