"President Obama hasn't just failed to change Washington, he's given up trying and our nation's seniors will pay the price. After promising AARP he would strengthen Medicare four years ago, the President has weakened the program by cutting $716 billion to pay for Obamacare. Our nation's seniors deserve better than the higher costs and fewer benefits that President Obama's policies will deliver. Mitt Romney will restore President Obama's Medicare cuts, while strengthening the program for future generations." — Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 OBAMA: "Now is the time to also strengthen and preserve Medicare, and these reforms will do just that. ... As President, these are the policies I will pursue so that older Americans can continue living the longer, better, more productive lives that they have every right to expect. AARP, that's how we'll renew Americans' confidence in a secure retirement. That's the change we need." (Senator Barack Obama, 
, Washington, DC, 9/6/08)
 OBAMA: "But I need your help to make it happen. So if you're ok with the next four years looking just like the last eight, then I am not your candidate. But if you want change - if you want to restore that fundamental promise we've made from generation to generation, then I ask you to give me your vote on November 4th. And if you do, I promise you - we will change this country together." (Senator Barack Obama,

 "The report offers fuel to President Obama's Republican critics and increases pressure on leaders of both parties to agree on a long-term plan to preserve the nation's principal safety net for the elderly. Medicare's main trust fund will be depleted by 2024, five years earlier than projected last year, according to the report by the trustees overseeing the program — largely because they have downgraded their expectations of economic growth."

 "The long-range financial imbalance could be addressed in several different ways. In theory, the standard 2.90-percent payroll tax and the additional tax 0.9-percent tax on high-income earners could be immediately increased by the amount of the actuarial deficit to 3.69 percent, or expenditures could be reduced by a corresponding amount. Note, however, that these changes would require an immediate 24-percent increase in the tax rate or an immediate 17-percent reduction in expenditures."

 "In the Office of the Actuary's April 22, 2010 memorandum on the estimated financial effects of the Affordable Care Act, we noted that by 2019 the update reductions would result in negative total facility margins for about 15 percent of hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and home health agencies. This estimated percentage would continue to increase, reaching roughly 25 percent in 2030 and 40 percent by 2050. In practice, providers could not sustain continuing negative margins and, absent legislative changes, would have to withdraw from providing services to Medicare beneficiaries, merge with other provider groups, or shift substantial portions of Medicare costs to their non-Medicare, non-Medicaid payers." ("Projected Expenditures Under An Illustrative Scenario With Alternative Payment Updates To Medicare Providers," Center For Medicare & Medicaid Services, 5/13/11)

 "In addition to flagging provider cuts as potentially unsustainable, the report [HHS] projected that reductions in payments to private Medicare Advantage plans would trigger an exodus from the popular alternative. Enrollment would plummet by about 50 percent. Seniors leaving the private plans would still have health insurance under traditional Medicare, but many might face higher out-of-pocket costs."

 "Currently, about 1 in every 4 Medicare beneficiary is enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan. For many of them, the words in this ad ring hollow, and the promise that 'benefits will remain the same' is just as fictional as the town of Mayberry was when Griffith played the local sheriff."
