Once again the Democratic Congress has acted to relieve farmers of some of the pressures resulting from increasing costs and falling prices. Today the House passed the Proxmire-Kennedy bill increasing price supports for manufacturing milk from $3.06, per hundredweight, to $3.22 and for butterfat from 56.6 cents per pound to 59.6 cents. If the usual pattern of the past 7 1/2 years prevails, the bill will be vetoed. If it is signed, it will be the first time that a bill which raises farm price supports has not been vetoed since 1952.
The bill will save dairy farmers from a potential $180 million annual loss of income.
A Democratic administration will guarantee that this will be but the first in a long - and long overdue - series of measures to be enacted into law which will give American farmers what they have not had in recent years: prices and income which are comparable to those received by other segments of our economy and in keeping with the farmers' contributions to our national welfare.
