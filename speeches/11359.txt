 section 21 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920 (41 Stat. 977), as amended and as incorporated into section 877, title 46, United States Code, provides:
From and after February 1, 1922, the coastwise laws of the United States shall extend to the island Territories and possessions of the United States not covered thereby on June 5, 1920, and the Commission is directed prior to the expiration of such year to have established adequate steamship service at reasonable rates to accommodate the commerce and the passenger travel of said islands and to maintain and operate such service until It can be taken over and operated and maintained upon satisfactory terms by private capital and enterprise: 
, That If adequate shipping service is not established by February 1, 1922, the President shall extend the period herein allowed for the establishment of such service in the case of any Island Territory or possession for such time as may be necessary for the establishment of adequate shipping facilities therefor * * *";
 an adequate shipping service to accommodate the commerce and the passenger travel of Canton Island has not been established as provided in the aforesaid section; and
 the extension of the coastwise laws of the United States to Canton Island, as provided in the aforesaid section, is dependent upon the establishment of such adequate shipping service; and
 by Proclamation No. 2448 of November 23, 1940, the period for the establishment of an adequate shipping service for Canton Island was extended to January 1, 1942, and the extension of the coastwise laws of the United States to Canton Island was deferred to January 1, 1942:
 President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 21 of the aforesaid Merchant Marine Act, 1920, as amended, do hereby declare and proclaim that the period for the establishment of an adequate shipping service for Canton Island is further extended to January 1, 1943, and that the extension of the coastwise laws of the United States to Canton Island is further deferred to January 1, 1943.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 31st day of December in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-sixth.
