The Trump campaign has spent months 
 in its attempts to attack Joe Biden, and with the announcement yesterday of his historic running mate, Kamala Harris, nothing has changed.

Team Trump can't land a punch because they can't even get their own made-up story straight.

Donald Trump's presidency is melting down. His failed, divisive, erratic leadership has cost over 160,000 American lives, tens of millions of jobs, and left the United States the hardest-hit country in the world by COVID-19.

As he struggles to divide the American people, in a desperate attempt to distract from his devastating mismanagement of this crisis, he's only further discrediting himself.

The Trump team even mismanaged their own response to the announcement of Kamala Harris as Joe Biden's running mate, dumbfounded by the selection of a strong and experienced VP who's ready to lead on Day 1. Senator Harris has gone toe-to-toe with Trump officials, asking the tough questions, demanding the truth, and not stopping until she gets answers for the American people.

They know Sen. Harris' track record of holding the Trump Administration to account in the halls of Congress, and they're terrified of her doing it on the campaign trail.
