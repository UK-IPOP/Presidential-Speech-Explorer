 — In a new 
 poll, 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul remains within striking distance of the lead among likely Iowa caucus voters. Paul takes 20.4 percent of the vote, within the margin of error of pizza baron Herman Cain who is tentatively holding the lead at 24.5 percent.
"These numbers are a confirmation of Congressman Paul's principled message," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton. "The American people are ready for real change in the way things are done in Washington, and Ron Paul is the only candidate who will fundamentally change the status quo, by offering serious cuts in spending, bringing our troops home, and restoring our economy to bring prosperity back to America."
This latest Iowa poll comes on the heels of a 
 showing Paul in a statistical tie for first place in Iowa and a strong second place in New Hampshire, and a 
 in which he was the only Republican candidate to best Obama among independent voters (48 to 39 percent). The 
 also notes that Paul gets nearly twice as much support as the rest of the field from those in the lower income brackets.
