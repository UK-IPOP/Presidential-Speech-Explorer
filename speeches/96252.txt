The Federal Government's responsibility for elementary and secondary education is properly focused on raising the academic achievement of all students and improving accountability for results, which this Administration has done. The Federal role should not be expanded to fund school modernization and repair projects at thousands of school districts across the Nation. That responsibility rests with State and local governments, and should remain there. For these reasons, the Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3021, the "21st Century Green High-Performing Public School Facilities Act", which would create an inappropriate and costly new Federal role in modernizing and renovating public schools. 
.
Furthermore, H.R. 3021 is poorly designed to accomplish its objectives, as it would spread funds by formula, often in very small amounts, to all school districts receiving Title I funds. The proposed program also fails to include any mechanisms for measuring performance or ensuring accountability. Moreover, school modernization and repair projects would be considered an "applicable program" under General Education Provisions Act (GEPA), subject to Davis-Bacon Act wage requirements. Because federal funds have not been typically used for this purpose, the Administration is also concerned that the application of Davis-Bacon wage requirements will only inflate the costs of such school modernization and repair projects.
