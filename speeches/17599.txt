Mr. President:
It is a very great privilege to welcome here the Head of the Liberian nation in which, since the founding of your government, our countrymen--our people--have taken a very deep and abiding interest.
And we are delighted that you have found it possible to pay here a courtesy visit, so that we can assure you again of our friendly feelings toward your country.
