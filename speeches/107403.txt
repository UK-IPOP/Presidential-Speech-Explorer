"Today Speaker Gingrich said it was 'just stupid' to point out that his unpopularity with the American people helped re-elect Democrats. As a historian, he should recall that Democrats linked Speaker Gingrich to Republican candidates all over the country in an effort to defeat them. Pointing out Speaker Gingrich's unreliable leadership isn't 'stupid' or dishonest - it's just a fact." -Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson

 ROTHENBERG: "Essentially, Democrats have to hold their own seats, and they have to pick up the Republican freshmen. The way they seem to be trying to do it is by nationalizing the election. Rather than take this district by district, they're trying to make the congressional elections a referendum not on Bob Dole and Bill Clinton but on Newt Gingrich and the Republican Congress."

 "Before flying to Little Rock, Ark., to vote and await election returns, the president made his final pitch, characterizing Republican challenger Bob Dole as a twin of House Speaker Newt Gingrich, contending that he has kept his promises and vowing to lay out a 'modern, moderate' agenda for the turn of the century."

, 11/7/98)
