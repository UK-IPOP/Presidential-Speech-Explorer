Graham said he's not afraid to let people know when he disagrees with them. And he proved it about 10 minutes later.
The same man led up to a question about the Islamic State by saying the United States should outlaw Islam in order to deal with the problem.
"You know what, I'm not your candidate," Graham said, cutting him off. "I don't want you to vote for me. I couldn't disagree with you more."
Graham said that in order to deal with Islamic State, he would strengthen the military and put more troops on the ground in Iraq. Outlawing Islam is not the answer, he said.
The man who asked the question left the event quickly, but at least one other attendee said he appreciated Graham's honest and straightforward response.
"(I liked) the manner in which he answered everything," said Paul Gorski, a retired Sioux City Republican. "He's not trying to tell people what they want to hear. He's telling people who he is."
