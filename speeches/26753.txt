I AM delighted with the cordial reception given Dr. Hornig and his colleagues by the Chinese Government and by the interest shown in their mission. American experience in expanding industry should be a valuable resource to draw upon in strengthening science and technology as a basis for social and economic progress in Taiwan. I look forward to new cooperative efforts which will make use of American experience in improving higher education, industrial research, and business management.
