 it is entirely fitting and proper that we should, from time to time, recall with gratitude the invaluable succor accorded this nation in its infancy by lovers of freedom who, though born beyond the seas, flocked to the standard of Washington and contributed substantially to the triumph of the American cause, each according to his abilities; and
 we are proud to number General Casimir Pulaski, a valiant son of Poland, in the ranks of those whose deeds are part of the imperishable record of American independence; and
 the Seventy-fifth Congress, by Public Resolution 102, approved on June 1, 1938, provided:
"That the President of the United States is authorized to issue a proclamation calling upon officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all governmental buildings on October 11, 1938, and inviting the people of the United States to observe the day in schools and churches, or other suitable places, with appropriate ceremonies in commemoration of the death of General Casimir Pulaski."
 President of the United States of America, do direct that the flag be displayed upon all Government buildings on October 11, 1938, as a mark of respect to the memory of General Casimir Pulaski, and do hereby invite the people of the United States to observe that day as General Pulaski Memorial Day and to participate with appropriate ceremonies in schools and churches or other suitable places in the solemn commemoration of General Pulaski's death on October 11, one hundred and fifty-nine years ago.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 31'' day of August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-third.
