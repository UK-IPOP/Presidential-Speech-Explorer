Pool Reports by 
, 
Morning from sunny Wilmington. Our call time has been pushed to noon.
Good afternoon. Pool is loading into a van shortly. No further details have been given. You know how this goes so the next pool report will come when something happens.
You'll have seen the unemployment statement from half an hour ago.
It's a sunny 88F here with very little chance of rain.
Pool picked up POTUS motorcade at the bottom of the lane, and we are rolling at 15:52.
For those who want to speculate, we are headed in the direction of the golf club.
Motorcade pulled into Fieldstone Golf Club at 16:00 after an uneventful spin through country lanes, surrounded by thickets of trees, big lawns and the occasional lake.
The pool van rather unexpectedly pulled through the gates. But was quickly turned around, and sent out again. Excitement over. And we are preparing to hold at the usual supermarket spot.
While the pool holds, the White House sends along this detail:
The President is playing golf with his brother James Biden.
OK, I said I wouldn't trouble you with unnecessary updates, but just in case you are worried we have disappeared into a sinkhole, rest assured that your pool continues to hold close to the golf club and has now closed down Janssen's Market. On the upside, the pool has had time to purchase extra underpants for the extended Wilmington stay.
Motorcade rolling from golf club at 19:51 as darkness descends.
Motorcade pulled into residence driveway at 20:01, leaving Pool van to peel off. We didn't see POTUS today. and haven't laid eyes on him since we saw his back briefly, as he got into motorcade after disembarking from Marine One on Tuesday.
Lid called at 20:01.
And that concludes our service for Friday. Let's do it all again tomorrow.
