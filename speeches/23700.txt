Dear Mr. Casals:
Mrs. Kennedy and I would like to extend an invitation to you to give a concert at The White House on Monday evening, November 13th. We feel that your performance as one of the world's greatest artists would lend distinction to the entertainment of our invited guests. I do hope you will honor us with your presence.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
[Mr. Pablo Casals, c/o Mr. Abe Fortas, 3025 N Street, N.W., Washington, D.C.]
