[Released September 9, 1932. Dated September 8, 1932]
Dear Mr. Pole:
I have today received your letter of resignation, and I must of course accept it. In doing so I wish to express my appreciation for your remaining in the service at my request many months after you had determined to accept a position elsewhere. But of much more importance than that, I know that I express not only my own appreciation but that of all of the other members of the Government for the extremely able manner in which you have conducted a most difficult task during this period of crisis. We all regret the necessity which compels you to leave the service of the Government, and it would be extremely difficult for us to find someone to take over the office with the assurance of such ability and effectiveness as that which you have shown.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER

[Honorable J. W. Pole, Comptroller of the Currency, Washington, D.C.]
