Hi all,
Lissa from The Boston Globe here. I hope you're having a great start to the year. I'm your in-town print pooler for the dayâ€” at this point, it's looking like a quiet day at the White House, but I'll pass along any updates if I get them.

Folks, we have a lunch lid until 2 p.m. EST.
Got the two-minute warning for press briefing at 2:34 p.m. EST. I won't be sending out updates from the briefing but can flag start and end time in a later report for those who need it.
Hi all,
We got a lid at 3:48 p.m. EST. For anyone who needs this info: The briefing started at 2:37 p.m. EST and ended at 3:36 p.m. EST. Have a great rest of the day, I'm sending positive vibes to those of you who are in for a long day of coverage. Don't forget to hydrate!
