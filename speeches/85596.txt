Tonight, the President spoke of the enduring values that keep America strong - freedom, faith, and family - and highlighted the need to encourage communities to focus on our most-at-risk youth.
The President is fully committed to empowering more of America's families, schools, and faith-based and community organizations to address some of our toughest social problems and help those most in need. President Bush's new proposals focus on an outreach to young, at-risk Americans to help them make healthy decisions and to help America's youth overcome the danger of gang influence and involvement.
Young Americans Are At Risk. While many trends in negative risk-taking among youth are heading in the right direction, risky behaviors, including illegal drug and tobacco use, violence and early sexual activity, are still among the top causes of disease and early death among youth. In addition, more children are growing up in homes without a father present, and studies show that an overwhelming number of violent criminals in the United States are males who grew up without fathers. Research has shown that the more children are connected to family, school, and community, the less likely they are to engage in risky behaviors.
