 Today's meeting launches President Bush's major economies initiative to work with all of the world's largest users of energy and largest producers of greenhouse gas emissions, including both developed and developing nations, to establish a new international approach on energy security and climate change in 2008 that will contribute to a global agreement by 2009 under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

 The private sector has responded with significant investments, ranging from corporate research and development to the venture capital markets.
 In addition, in partnership with other nations and the private sector, the U.S. is moving closer to producing energy from the world's first zero emissions coal-fired plant.
 Just last week, a company filed the first application since the 1970s to build new nuclear reactors in the U.S.
 Taken together, low-carbon technologies like wind and solar power have the potential to contribute significantly to America's electricity production.
 
 This plan will help reduce U.S. gasoline consumption by as much as 20 percent in ten years by:
 The world's forests help reduce the amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere by storing carbon dioxide in trees. But when our forests disappear, the concentration of greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere increases. We need to preserve and expand forests at home and abroad.
 
 We welcome and support new initiatives from Australia, Brazil, China, and Indonesia, and will continue to do our part. We remain committed to initiatives such as the Congo Basin Forest Partnership and Asia Forest Partnership. We will also continue our efforts through the Tropical Forest Conservation Act, which helps developing nations redirect debt payments toward forest conservation programs.
