In his State of the Union Address, the President proposed a standard deduction for health insurance to make private health insurance more affordable and to level the playing field so those who buy health insurance on their own get the same tax advantage as those who get health insurance through their jobs. He also proposed the Affordable Choices Initiative to help eligible States assist their poor and hard-to-insure citizens in purchasing private health insurance.
 Unlike those who get insurance through their jobs, people who buy health insurance on their own have to pay for it with after-tax dollars and receive no assistance from the tax code.
Americans who are self-employed pay no income taxes on their premiums, but because they still owe payroll taxes, they are also disadvantaged compared to those who get insurance through their employers.
 Under the President's proposal, families with health insurance will pay no income or payroll taxes on $15,000 dollars of income. Single Americans with health insurance will pay no income or payroll taxes on $7,500 of income.
 States that make basic private health insurance available to all their citizens should receive Federal funds to help them provide this coverage to the poor and the sick. Under the Affordable Choices Initiative, existing Federal funds would be used to create Affordable Choices grants to give eligible governors more money and more flexibility to get private health insurance to those most in need.
