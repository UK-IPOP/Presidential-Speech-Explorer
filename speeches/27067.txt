IN REPLY TO your telegram, after conferring with the appropriate members of the Cabinet, I have directed them to help meet the emergency health, food and safety needs of the citizens of Detroit that cannot be met by state and local resources. To that end I have asked Mr. Vance and Mr. Christopher to confer with you immediately to determine what those needs are and to report promptly.
I have also instructed the officials concerned to move without delay to meet the needs of those who have suffered at the hands of rioters, as soon as those needs can be determined. The decision to move food into Detroit for those in need was made yesterday. I have directed the release of drugs and hospital equipment for emergency use and they are available upon the request of your health authorities.
