 The people of Burma deserve to enjoy basic liberties such as freedom of speech, assembly, and worship. The United States calls on the Burmese regime to engage in a genuine dialogue with its own people, including the leaders of the pro-democracy movement and ethnic minority groups, on a transition to a civilian, democratic government. The Burmese regime should release those who have been arrested for peacefully expressing their views, including Aung San Suu Kyi, and should also exercise restraint in the face of peaceful protests.
 The President urged the United Nations and all nations to use their diplomatic and economic leverage to help the Burmese people reclaim their freedom.
 Sanctions against Burma were first imposed in 1997 with the issuance of Executive Order 13047. These sanctions were augmented on July 28, 2003 by the enactment of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act and the issuance of Executive Order 13310.
 Burma is experiencing a crisis on many fronts, including in health and education, and these humanitarian groups carry out important work to help in these areas.
