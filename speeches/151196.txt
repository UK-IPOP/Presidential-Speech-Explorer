Greetings from the first state, where it's barely above freezing, with a wind chill making it feel like 25 for your Covid-free pooler's coffee run.
The call time has been pushed from noon to 3:30pm.
There is nothing on President Biden's public schedule today in Wilmington.
The presidential motorcade pulled away from the Bidens' Wilmington neighborhood at 4:51 pm.
The pool joined from the holding spot. No way to peer into the garage from a mile away, though four or five deer were spotted in the field beside the road.
President Biden arrived at St. Joseph on the Brandywine church for 5pm Mass six minutes early.
The church is undergoing renovation from Jan. 9 to Feb. 20. Per its website, during the "Renew, Refresh, Rejoice church renovation project," Mass is being held at the Family Center next door.
The president was inside at 4:54.
President Biden emerged from the St. Joseph on the Brandywine Family Center, where Mass is being held during renovation of the main sanctuary, at 5:47 pm.
The sun is down and the wind chill is in the low 20s. Pool wisely chose to hold in the warm bus during the 5 o'clock Mass. Back on the lawn for departure, we were way too far to shout questions.
Motorcade rolled at 5:51.
The presidential motorcade arrived back at the Biden residence in Wilmington in the dark at 5:57 pm after an uneventful 6-minute drive from church.
We could not see his SUV turn down his driveway.
A lid has been called.
That's it tonight from Wilmington.
