 Mr. President, have you heard about Justice Blackmun's resignation tomorrow?
 I can't comment on it. Let's let him speak for himself.
 Have you spoken to him in the last two days?
 I have not.
 Have you got a short list, Mr. President?
 Let Justice Blackmun speak for himself. I have not spoken to him. We have to let him speak for himself.
 Has he written to you? Has he notified you?
 No. I have not talked to him. I have not talked to him or, to the best of my knowledge, we have received no letter from him. Let's let him speak for himselfâ€”some communication with him tomorrow.
