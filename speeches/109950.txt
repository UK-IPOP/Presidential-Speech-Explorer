"Senator Santorum's two decades in Washington may have earned him friends inside the Beltway, but apparently he lost some friends in Pennsylvania along the way. It is telling that many of the leaders who know Rick Santorum best are supporting Mitt Romney for president." —Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 "Fiscal conservatives see him as a big-government, pork-barrel spender. And some social conservatives question his support of former Sen. Arlen Specter, who supported abortion rights." (Robert J. Vickers, "Pennsylvania GOP Leaders Believe Rick Santorum Isn't A Good Fit For The Presidency,"

 "But influential party leaders who did not want to be identified said a Santorum nomination would doom the country to four more years of Obama. ... 'We need somebody that's going to bring us together, not drive us apart, and Rick can be divisive.'" (Robert J. Vickers, "Pennsylvania GOP Leaders Believe Rick Santorum Isn't A Good Fit For The Presidency,"

 "'I discount him totally out of hand because of the way he ran his last race in Pennsylvania,' an influential state GOP figure said of Santorum's presidential aspiration. 'His last campaign was a disaster. His attitude wasn't a little bit abrasive. It was a lot abrasive. You just couldn't tell Rick anything.'" (Robert J.

 "Though it's believed that the endorsement itself irked party conservatives, many now say it was the fervor with which Santorum attacked Toomey that turned their stomachs. 'He went to an extra level of vindictiveness and nastiness against Pat Toomey,' said Shafik, the former Santorum aide, who worked on Toomey's failed 2004 campaign. 'He called up donors and said, 'Don't give to Pat.'' And he recorded a TV ad discounting criticisms of Specter as a liberal that finished with him saying, 'I'm proud to endorse Arlen Specter.' After the campaign, Santorum bragged that Toomey lost because of his endorsement, Shafik said." (Robert J.

 "Santorum's last race — an 18 percentage point defeat in 2006 — raises questions about his appeal to independent voters who could help decide the national election in November, as well as to Republicans who will determine who gets the party's nomination. Santorum's loss was 'the largest defeat by a Republican United States senator seeking election or re-election in modern Pennsylvania history,' said G. Terry Madonna, a public affairs professor at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania." (Julie Hirschfield Davis, "Santorum's Electability Pitch Undermined By 2006 Senate Re-Election Loss," Bloomberg, 2/14/12)
 "Santorum's loss was a long time coming. By the time of his nearly 18-point loss — a stunning margin for a two-term incumbent — he had also alienated women voters, moderate Republicans and independents — not to mention the Democrats he had once won over. He lost almost every region of the state and almost every demographic group, including the blue collar workers he singles out on the campaign trail in 2012."
