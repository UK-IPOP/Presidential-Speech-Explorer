 CRAWFORD: "In many ways, Christie's speech was pitch perfect, a speech for our time. He talked directly to all those people, Charlie and Norah, who are worried our best days are behind us. And he said, you know, we're not going to sugar coat this. He made an indirect hit on President Obama and said we're not going to pander to you. We're going to tell you the truth, the hard truths, and we're going to get this done. It was never, never give up, almost like Winston Churchill. But also morning in America, Reagan, we can get to those better days." (CBS's "This Morning," 8/29/12)

 "No one in the GOP gives a speech like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Clapping his hands and punching the air he strode onto the stage at the RNC, and then he proceeded to wow the crowd. If Ann Romney was empathetic, he was tough. If she vouched for her husband, he vouched for Americans. They were the yin and yang of the first night of the convention." (
