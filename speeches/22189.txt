I HAVE signed S. 2772, amending the Alaska Omnibus Act.
This legislation authorizes grants to the State of Alaska of $23.5 million to replace revenues lost and expenses incurred in connection with the earthquake of March 27.
As a result of that tragedy, Alaska, its people, its cities and towns, and its economy have suffered great hardship and encountered burdensome problems.
Much is being done by the Federal Government, the State, and private groups and individuals to alleviate the situation. This legislation is aimed at one significant aspect of the disaster--the provision of funds needed to continue State and local government functions.
The Congress is to be congratulated for its prompt action on this vital measure.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
