ALL OF US are saddened by the passing of Trygve Lie. He was more than an outstanding citizen and public official of his country; as first Secretary General of the United Nations, he was in a very real sense the man who had more to do than any other in building up the structure of the United Nations Secretariat to carry the heavy burdens that organization has since assumed.
Trygve Lie responded to the crisis and strains in the early years of the organization. With unfailing courage and constancy he rendered great service to all men, and the world will miss him.
