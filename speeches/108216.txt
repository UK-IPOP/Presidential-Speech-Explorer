"Three years ago, even fellow Democrats said Barack Obama wasn't ready to be president and that his campaign practiced 'gutter politics.' With over half a million Pennsylvanians out of a job today, President Obama and his allies still seem more interested in launching negative campaign attacks against Mitt Romney than getting the country back to work. President Obama told Pennsylvanians they would be better off under his leadership, and they will hold him accountable for his failed economic record." â€“Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman
