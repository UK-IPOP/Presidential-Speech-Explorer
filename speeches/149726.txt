Pool Reports by 
, 
Greetings from sunny Wilmington.
After a whirlwind Friday, POTUS has no public events scheduled today or tomorrow. Our call time has already been pushed back twice today, first to 1 p.m. and now to 3:30 p.m. I will send along further updates as they come.
Pool gathered at 3:30, though again there are no public events scheduled today.
We loaded onto the bus and started moving, and are now holding next to a cornfield just west of the Wilmington city limits. Haven't been told where we are going just yet.
More soon.
Press bus joined up with the POTUS motorcade at 5:01.
POTUS is attending Mass at St. Joseph on the Brandywine Roman Catholic Church. Pool saw potus walk inside sporting a blue blazer and khakis at 5:04. It looked like no other family members were present.
We are now holding outside the church during the service.
POTUS left the church at 5:46, shook hands and chatted with a priest and other churchgoers before entering a Suburban at 5:49. No other family members were with him.
Press got back on the bus and rode with the motorcade for a while before peeling off at 5:55, when the lid was called.
Have a great Saturday night!
