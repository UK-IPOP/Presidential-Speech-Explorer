THE NOBLE and distinterested public services of Haym Salomon deserve the undying gratitude of all Americans. The aid of his financial genius and his wealth was of critical importance in the Revolutionary struggle which created us a Nation. It is indeed fitting that these services should be commemorated with an enduring monument that will remind us ever of his patriotism and self-sacrifice.
