Hillary Clinton received the endorsements of leading Wisconsin officials and community leaders today, illustrating her growing support in the Badger State.
"On questions of foreign policy and national security, Senator Clinton will lead this country with both strength and experience," said Tom Loftus, former Speaker of the Wisconsin Assembly and Ambassador to Norway. "She showed that in the first debate, she has shown that in the U.S. Senate, and I saw her demonstrate that when she met with leaders from other countries during the Clinton Administration. Senator Clinton has represented all of the people of New York--including its dairy industry--effectively and forcefully in the U.S. Senate, and she understands the challenges facing diverse states like Wisconsin that rely on urban industry, small business and agriculture for economic growth."
Dane County Executive Kathleen Falk said, "Hillary Clinton is strong, smart and experienced. She is battle-tested and has the broad experience needed to lead our nation, at home and abroad. Hillary Clinton has devoted 35 years to creating better lives for children and families and will continue that work as President."
