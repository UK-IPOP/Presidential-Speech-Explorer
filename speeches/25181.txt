FOLLOWING meetings with the National Security Council, I have directed the orderly withdrawal of American dependents from South Viet-Nam.
It has become clear that Hanoi has undertaken a more aggressive course of action against both South Vietnamese and American installations, and against Americans who are in South Viet-Nam assisting the people of that country to defend their freedom. We have no choice now but to dear the decks and make absolutely clear our continued determination to back South Viet-Nam in its fight to maintain its independence.
In addition to this action, I have ordered the deployment to South Viet-Nam of a Hawk air defense battalion. Other reinforcements, in units and individuals, may follow.
