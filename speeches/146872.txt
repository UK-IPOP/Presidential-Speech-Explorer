Good morning from a cloudy Wilmington.
Your pool got tested this morning and joined the motorcade next to the president's residence.
It is 9.58 am and we are now rolling.
President Biden's motorcade arrived at St Joseph on the Brandywine at 10 am.
Your pool saw the President enter the church from a distance. He was wearing a light blue jacket and dark slacks.
Your pooler could not immediately identify who the President is attending mass with, will ask the White House.
Next to the church a man was standing, holding a handmade sign « Joe Biden equals abortion euthanasia and infanticide ».
Onpassing this from the White House:
Accompanying the President to mass are his granddaughters Finnegan and Natalie Biden.
