 Hey, look who's here.
 Hi, everybody.
 Barney's back. [

 Barney had a really good trip.
 Hey, Spot, look who's here.
 Mrs. Bush, where are you coming from?
 I'm coming from Texas. I've been at the ranch.
 What do you expect out of your meeting with the Irish leaders?
 Pardon me?
 What do you expect out of your meeting with the Irish PM—Prime Minister?
 I had a good meeting, and I'll have one tomorrow, as well. Looking forward to it. We'll be discussing the Good Friday agreement, what I can do to help; be reaffirming our trade with Ireland. We had a good visit with him at lunch.
I'm looking forward to seeing him tomorrow.
 Mr. President, are you prepared to send your suggestions on campaign finance legislation to the Hill, and——
 Pretty soon.
 ——what would you like to see in it?
 Well, wait until I send them up there, but we'll be sending some principles up here pretty soon.
 Not today?
 Maybe today.
 Mr. President, to follow up, I mean, do you still support limited soft money contributions?
 I think we ought to get rid of labor union and corporate soft money. And I know we need to make sure we have—to make sure that shareholders and labor union members have got a sayso on how their money is spent.
 Thank you all very much.
 Just getting warmed up. [

 Thank you, Barney.
