"Today, with the Republican National Convention underway, President Obama's campaign is going off the rails with reprehensible attacks and reckless charges against Governor Romney.  With a growing number of Americans, including nearly three in ten Democrats, believing President Obama has no plan to create jobs, it's clear his campaign cannot defend the President's abysmal record of lost jobs, higher poverty rates, and middle-class suffering.  Mitt Romney has a plan to get our nation back on track with 12 million new jobs and higher take-home pay for middle-class families." – Romney Campaign Senior Adviser Danny Diaz

 "By going on the road, Mr. Obama is bucking protocol. Incumbents usually stay home while the opposing party plots their defeat. In 2004, President Bush kept a low profile while the Democrats were nominating John F. Kerry, although Vice President Dick Cheney did campaign during the Democratic convention. In 1996, 1992, 1984 and 1980, Presidents Clinton, George H.W. Bush, Reagan and Carter, respectively, laid low while the opposing parties' conventions were held."
