Mr. Prime Minister, and all of our distinguished guests today:
It is a very great honor, Mr. Prime Minister, to welcome you, both as the representative of a nation with which the United States has such close and friendly ties, but also to welcome you as a personal friend.
And on this magnificent--I would describe it Roman--day, we think of those ties that bind our two countries together. There are nine million Americans who proudly claim their Italian background.
In fact, Mr. Prime Minister, I understand there are more Italians living in the United States than there are in Rome. And they have contributed enormously to the vitality and the strength and the vision of this country.
We think also of what your country through the ages has contributed to all nations and particularly to ours: the heritage of law, of culture, the arts, of all the areas with which we are familiar.
But on this day, we think of the present and of what we can do in the future. We think of the fact that Italy and the United States are part of a great, peaceful partnership, a partnership which exists not just for defense, but exists for the kind of progress for our people, all of our people, a better life, the people of Italy, the people of the United States, the people of Europe, and, for that matter, the people of the world.
This is a great goal. In our conversations that we had in your country just a few months ago, we talked about that goal and how our two countries could work together to achieve it.
And I know that as we meet today with you and with the other members of your party, we will develop further programs where Italy and the United States will work together in the cause of peace and friendship and progress for all the nations of the world.
