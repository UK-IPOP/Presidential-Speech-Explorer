 Since August 2003, 8.31 million jobs have been created, with 1.68 million jobs created over the 12 months that ended in October. Our economy has now added jobs for 50 straight months – the longest period of uninterrupted job growth on record. The unemployment rate remains low at 4.7 percent.
 Even though Fiscal Year 2008 began 33 days ago, Congress has failed to send a single spending bill to the President's desk – the worst record for a Congress in 20 years.
 In addition, Congressional Democrats have proposed tax increases in the farm bill, the energy bill, the small business bill, and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) bill.
 Instead, the House and Senate have passed an SCHIP bill that raises taxes to move two million children from private health insurance to a government run program. This bill repeals the requirement that 95 percent of children below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level be covered before coverage is extended to new children from higher income families, it still allows states to cover adults, and it costs more over the next five years than the bill the President vetoed four weeks ago.
 These free trade agreements will create better-paying jobs for American workers and farmers, and provide new opportunities for American entrepreneurs.
