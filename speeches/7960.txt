Dear Mr. Secretary:
I have a feeling that it would be a fine tribute to the late Senator Francis E. Warren if the military post at Cheyenne in which he was so long interested could be renamed for him. In doing so it would be desirable to select some post that would properly commemorate the name of General D. A. Russell, whose distinguished service should ever be before our people.
I would be glad if you could make arrangements that would meet with this suggestion.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[The Honorable Patrick J. Hurley, Acting Secretary of War, Washington, D.C.]
