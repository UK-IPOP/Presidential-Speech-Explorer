Good morning from Wilmington where the 10am call time has been pushed to midday.
I'll keep you posted if anything happens.
Cheers
until 13:15
Good afternoon from downtown Wilmington, where the current temperature is 81F and there is a chance of rain later in the afternoon.
Pool is loading into van. All other details remain unknown. Apart from the weather.
Pool has been swept and is holding in van at top of lane leading to Biden residence. More when/if anything changes.
Pool is pleased to inform you that a motorcade is rolling from Biden residence at 15:10. We did not see Biden as it swung by pool bus, which has tagged on the end. Destination unknown.
Pool peeled off motorcade as it pulled into Fieldstone Golf Club at 15:18. Pool has asked for list of golfing partners. Weather is overcast and rain is forecast.
We will be holding elsewhere in the meantime.
The White House passes along that POTUS is playing golf with the father-in-law of his late son Beau.
The President is golfing with Ron Olivere.
Motorcade rolled out of Fieldstone Golf Club at 17:12. Pool van tagged on the end. We haven't seen POTUS yet today.
There was a little drizzle at the pool hold location - but difficult to tell if it had rained at the golf club.
Motorcade pulled into residence driveway at 17:22 leaving pool van to peel away. And a lid was called at 17:23.
That concludes your service from Wilmington and environs. More tomorrow. Or maybe less.
