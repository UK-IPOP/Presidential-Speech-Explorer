In the 21st Century, a college education is more important than ever. Hillary Clinton believes it's time for a new bargain with the American people – a bargain that gives all Americans willing to work hard the tools they need to get ahead. Her plan will make college more affordable and accessible so that every American who has earned it and wants to go has the chance to get a college degree.
By providing a $3,500 tuition tax credit—more than 50% of the cost of tuition at the average public institution—and increasing Pell grants, Hillary's plan will unlock the doors to higher education for millions of young Americans. In addition, Hillary will simplify the student aid process and strengthen incentives for students interested in public service.
"When it comes to higher education – we shouldn't be playing catch-up with the world – we should be leading it. Because the skills and knowledge of our workforce will determine whether America can compete and win in the global economy," Clinton said.
"I believe that college shouldn't just be a privilege for the wealthy – but an opportunity for anyone with the talent, determination and ambition to learn. And I believe that every American should have access to lifelong learning opportunities – from apprenticeships, to community college, to the most select four-year institutions.
"This tax credit is at the heart of my plan – the key to unlocking the doors of higher education for students across America, many of whom never dreamed they'd be able to attend. And the key to unleashing the power of the American economy as well."
The most important doorway into the middle class is education beyond high school. Today a college graduate earns twice as much as a high school graduate. That is a million-dollar bonus over the working lifetimes of today's college seniors. But college is still out of reach for many students from middle class and low-income families. Only 7% of students from low-income communities get a B.A. by age 26.[i]
One of the most significant obstacles to finishing college is the expense. In the past 25 years, the average cost of tuition and fees has risen faster than personal income, consumer prices and even health insurance.[ii] It has gone up 35% in the last five years alone.[iii] As a result, the average student graduates with $20,000 in debt and many students graduate with the equivalent of a mortgage in student loans.[iv]
 Hillary will take action to put college degrees back in reach to for middle- and low-income families. Her plan will:
 The new college tax credit and other initiatives in this agenda will cost approximately $8 billion per year. These costs will be financed without increasing the deficit by eliminating the guaranteed student loan program and allocating a portion of the savings from freezing the estate tax at $7 million per couple rather than allowing it to be completely repealed. Freezing the estate tax at $7 million per couple will have no effect on 99.7% of estates. It will mean instead that the 10,000 wealthiest estates in the U.S. do not receive a further tax cut.
