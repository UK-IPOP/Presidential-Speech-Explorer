Thompson is absolutely pro-life, period, no waffling about it. He is solidly pro-Second Amendment, period, no dithering. He's a gung-ho war on terror man, a no-nonsense border security man. America is about to find out whether Republicans lean more toward Thompson's unabashed purity on social issues - or toward the practical executive experience touted by Giuliani and Romney.
To date, Thompson has played his cards cannily, and he walks into this party with Favorite New Flavor all over him. American politics has, of course, seen his likes before. Thus, Thompson's serious test starts now. Voters will make up their minds soon enough whether he's just another pretty face.
