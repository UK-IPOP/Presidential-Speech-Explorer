"Nothing is more important than getting Admiral Fallon, General Petraeus, American commanders in Afghanistan, and Ambassadors Crocker and Wood what they need, and Douglas Lute can make sure that happens quickly and reliably."
 
 In that position, Lt. General Lute [pronounced LOOT] is charged with coordinating the efforts of the Executive Branch to support our commanders and senior diplomats on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 The President's "New Way Forward" for Iraq requires greater coordination and flexibility here at home. General Lute will handle, full-time, the implementation and execution of our strategies for Iraq and Afghanistan, and will lead policy development process for these two theaters.
 As an Assistant to the President, General Lute's office is focused on day-to-day implementation and policy development. He will work closely with National Security Advisor Steve Hadley, who provides overall staff leadership.
