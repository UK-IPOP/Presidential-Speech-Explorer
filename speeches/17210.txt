[Released April 10, 1956. Dated April 9, 1956]
My dear Mr. :
The attached letter, addressed to me by the Secretary of Defense, reviews the serious nature of the personnel situation in the armed forces. It also outlines the major legislative proposals which the Administration has presented to the Congress as a means of improving military career incentives.
I urge that this legislation be enacted. Only when we have created a career military service which can compete with the attractive opportunities available in civilian pursuits will we be able to stop the wasteful losses from our armed forces and attract individuals to those services. We cannot move too soon in our efforts to increase the number and quality of volunteers for longterm career military service in both enlisted and officer ranks.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
