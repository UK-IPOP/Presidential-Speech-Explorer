THE ACT authorizing United States assistance to Greece and Turkey, which I have just signed, is an important step in the building of the peace. Its passage by overwhelming majorities in both Houses of the Congress is proof that the United States earnestly desires peace and is willing to make a vigorous effort to help create conditions of peace.
The conditions of peace include, among other things, the ability of nations to maintain order and independence, and to support themselves economically. In extending the aid requested by two members of the United Nations for the purpose of maintaining these conditions, the United States is helping to further aims and purposes identical with those of the United Nations. Our aid in this instance is evidence not only that we pledge our support to the United Nations but that we act to support it.
With the passage and signature of this act, our Ambassadors to Greece and Turkey are being instructed to enter into immediate negotiations for agreements which, in accordance with the terms of the act, will govern the application of our aid. We intend to make sure that the aid we extend will benefit all the peoples of Greece and Turkey, not any particular group or faction.
I wish to express my appreciation to the leaders and members of both parties in the Congress for their splendid support in obtaining the passage of this vital legislation.
