Mr. President, Senors Frondizi, Ladies and Gentlemen:

Something over ninety years ago, there was a very distinguished son of the Argentine who visited President Andrew Johnson. His name was Domingo Faustino Sarmiento. He was a scholar, a statesman, and a patriot. He came to this country as our friend, and we are proud to say that he went back as our greater friend. There was forged between him and between those whom he met a very strong friendship that lasted throughout his life. Subsequently he became President of Argentina, your distinguished predecessor.
Now you, Mr. President, come to meet us as the already freely elected President of the Argentine, and we devoutly hope that you, your lovely Senors, and your party, will go back with the same feeling that Sarmiento had--that you go back better friends of the United States than when you came here.
We feel that the historic friendship between your country and ours cannot fail to be strengthened by this visit, and we very much hope that you already have the feeling, here in this country, that feeling that is so graciously expressed in your language, "en su casa."
So, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that you will rise to drink with me a Toast to Dr. Arturo Frondizi, President of the Argentine, and Senora Frondizi.
