"Since I took office, we've cut taxes for every American who pays income taxes. … [Congress' budget] allows the tax relief we delivered to be taken away. Here's what that would mean for the average taxpayer: If you have children, your taxes would rise $500 per child. If you have a family of four making $60,000 a year, your taxes would be more than $1,800 higher. If you're a small business owner, your taxes would increase almost $4,000. … The price of these tax increases would not be paid in the halls of Congress – it would be paid in living rooms and shop floors and office buildings across America."
