Though the media isn't covering it, today is actually the anniversary of a historic moment in global affairs.

Eight years ago today — January 4th 2008 — was the first day many people around the world heard the name Barack Obama. They awoke to the news that a little-known Senator from Illinois had won the Iowa caucuses the night before, and that a political frenzy was sweeping the United States. As that year went on, many around the world who resented America's influence found a lot to like about this man.

"America is in far greater danger than it was 8 years ago," Rubio says

When you vote for me, you know exactly what you'll get. You'll get a president who will destroy terrorists overseas by authorizing whatever tools our commanders need. You'll get a reversal of the defense cuts that Obama and Harry Reid have forced on our military. You'll get a leader who upholds the promise we make to our men and women in uniform that we will never send them into a fair fight, but will always equip them with the upper hand. Anyone who supports Obama's disastrous defense cuts cannot make that promise.
Rubio says he will not just restore but "strengthen" NSA's capabilities, "because ISIS does not use carrier pigeons to communicate."

Rubio: "Unlike some candidates, I don't think foreign terrorists captured abroad should get any rights under our Constitution"

I will be a president who doesn't just believe America is the greatest country in the world; I will be a president who acts like it. I will take the global stage and say, "I know what the last eight years have been like, but America is back. We once again have a president who understands our role in the world."
