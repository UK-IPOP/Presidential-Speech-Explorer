IT IS EXTREMELY gratifying to learn that the Canton Exchange Bank, through the cooperation of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and the State Banking Department of Mississippi, has reopened its doors, resuming a service covering a span of more than fifty years. Yours is a community which now realizes how dependent every individual in the town is upon the continuous functioning of our institutions and in restoring this service to them you are serving the community.
