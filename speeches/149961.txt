Under Gina McCarthy and Ali Zaidi's leadership, my administration has taken the most aggressive action ever, from historic legislation to bold executive actions, to confront the climate crisis head on. The Inflation Reduction Act is the biggest step forward on clean energy and climate in history, and it paves the way for additional steps we will take to meet our clean energy and climate goals.
We are fortunate that John Podesta will lead our continued innovation and implementation. His deep roots in climate and clean energy policy and his experience at senior levels of Government mean we can truly hit the ground running to take advantage of the massive clean energy opportunity in front of us.
I am immensely grateful for Gina's service, and I am proud to announce the promotion of Ali to National Climate Advisor. Gina has been an invaluable member of my senior staff since day one of the administration, and I wish her the best as she moves forward.
