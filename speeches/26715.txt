To the Congress of the United States:
I am pleased to transmit the eleventh annual report on the Trade Agreements Program. This report is required by section 402(a) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, covering calendar year 1966.
1966 was another remarkable year for international trade. World trade during the year rose by 9.5%, bringing great benefits to all the nations of the free world. The United States shared fully in this growth. Our foreign trade set new records, adding to the strength of our economy and to the income and welfare of our people.
The United States played a major role during 1966 in efforts to improve conditions of world commerce and to stimulate the growth of trade. The drive to conclude the Kennedy Round--the most ambitious multilateral attempt to reduce trade barriers ever undertaken--was the most important of these efforts. This negotiation was successfully concluded on June 30, 1967 and will pay dividends for every American and the entire Free World.
We have had two decades of unprecedented growth in world trade which contributed greatly to the economic progress of this country and of our trading partners. We must maintain this momentum.
