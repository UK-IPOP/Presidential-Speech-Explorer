In his first State of the Union, the President spoke directly to the American people about his vision to build a better America. He reminded the country that our best days lie ahead, and that his Presidency is about giving everyone a fair shot ? because when given half a shot, ordinary people can do extraordinary things. The Biden-Harris Administration's domestic agenda represents an historic shift from the old, outdated trickle-down approach to one that puts workers, families, and small businesses first.
The President also announced his unity agenda, consisting of four areas where we have historically been able to come together and find agreement regardless of party. He has called on Congress to send bills to his desk to deliver progress for the American people: to beat the opioid crisis, address mental health, support our veterans, and end cancer as we know it.
Over the next year, the Biden-Harris Administration will continue working to make communities safer, combat COVID, and create good-paying jobs through revitalized domestic manufacturing.
Members of the House and Senate championed the President's remarks.
 "Here's how far we've come with President Biden and Dems in Congress: ? Fastest economic growth in one year since the 80s ? More jobs in one year than in any president's 1st year on record ? COVID cases dropping ? Over 215M Americans vaccinated And there's so much more to do! #SOTU" [

 "Tonight, President Biden laid out his vision to build a better America for all of us. This is especially important for the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities that have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. We need to help AAPI families get back to work and back on their feet and that is precisely what the President detailed tonight. For starters, the pandemic exposed the deep inequalities in these communities, especially when it comes to healthcare. That is why I'm so grateful to the President for his plans to keep the costs of prescription drugs down, extend the Child Tax Credit, and ensure affordable housing, all three of which are areas where AAPI families were hit the hardest over the past year. Additionally, his commitment to providing a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, TPS holders, farm workers, and essential workers, including millions of AAPI immigrants, is a promise to keep our communities whole and our economy growing. Finally, I appreciate the President continuing to speak out about the ongoing plague of anti-Asian violence in our country which has led to over 10,000 anti-Asian hate incidents since the start of the pandemic alone. Thanks to President Biden, the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act is now signed into law, and next, we in Congress must make sure it is fully funded in order to implement all the tools necessary to track and respond to hate crimes."
