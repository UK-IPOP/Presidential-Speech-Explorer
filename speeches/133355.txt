Mr. Chairman, it's a great honor to be with you. And I know that we'll have tremendous success together, and we'll solve a big problem, a big dilemma, that, until this point, has been unable to be solved. I know that, working together, we will get it taken care of. So it's a great honor. Thank you very much.

Well, we successfully—[
]—the beaten path. That way—[
]—and we overcame all kinds of skepticism and speculations about this summit, and I believe that this is a good prelude for peace.

 I believe, too.

 [
]—moving forward in close cooperation with you, Mr. President. Of course, there will be—[
]—ahead, but I am ready to listen. I'm ready to move forward.

 We will solve it. We will be successful, and I look forward to working on it with you. It will be done.

Thank you very much. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much.
