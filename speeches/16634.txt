My dear General Fleming:
I am happy to receive the report of the Continuing Committee which clearly shows the progress made in fire prevention during the past year. It is indeed gratifying that so many organizations and individuals gave such wholehearted support to this cause. Please express my appreciation to all of your co-workers.
Though this is a final report of the Continuing Committee, I personally feel that our battle against fire and fire hazards has only begun. As long as fire kills and injures so many people and destroys such vast amounts of property each year, we must all strive for better fire prevention and fire protection.
Therefore, I am asking you and the members of your committees not to consider your work completed. Wherever possible I trust that all of you will continue to play an active role in supporting the programs which you helped our states and communities launch. We must carry forward the program of education to show our people the constant need for fire prevention in their homes, schools, factories and offices.
Only by these means can we hope to achieve the full objectives adopted at the conference last May.
HARRY S. TRUMAN
