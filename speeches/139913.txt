Trump is attempting to declare victory for an economy that is leaving working families struggling and the middle class behind in favor of his Park Avenue pals.

Here's the truth: Just like everything else he's inherited, Donald Trump squandered the strong economy he was handed by the Obama-Biden Administration. He's now on track to be the worst jobs president since Herbert Hoover. The growth that's occurring in spite of Trump's historic failures of leadership is overwhelmingly flowing to those at the top.

Thanks to Donald Trump's ongoing and reckless refusal to take this pandemic seriously or get to work to deliver desperately needed relief to America's families, our economy is currently stalling out as layoffs rise and infections surge. In this K-shaped "recovery," it's workers who are getting screwed: out of PPE, out of wages, and out of health care. All because of Donald Trump.
