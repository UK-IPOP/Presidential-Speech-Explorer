This week, 70 economists signed a letter praising President Biden's American Jobs Plan – joining a growing coalition of support for the President's once-in-a-century investment in creating good-paying jobs and boosting competitiveness, including a 
 
 of the American people.
They write, "We need large-scale public investments that will build on the growth spurred by the American Rescue Plan and create millions of high-paying jobs. A multitrillion-dollar investment in infrastructure like the one President Biden laid out last week will help pave the way for sustainable and equitable economic growth and pay for itself in the long run."
The coronavirus pandemic has laid bare the consequences of decades' worth of underinvestment in our communities, dealing a devastating blow to American workers, families, and small businesses — particularly in communities of color. While the American Rescue Plan's public investments have helped staunch the bleeding, more must be done to address the massive loss of jobs, our underfunded and crumbling infrastructure, an ever-widening racial wealth gap, and the rising economic cost of inaction on climate change.
Big problems like these must be met with big solutions. We cannot afford to think small.
We need large-scale public investments that will build on the growth spurred by the American Rescue Plan and create millions of high-paying jobs. A multi-trillion dollar investment in infrastructure like the one President Biden laid out last week will help pave the way for sustainable and equitable economic growth and pay for itself in the long run.
The American Rescue Plan was a historic investment that saved our economy from catastrophe. We must now be even more ambitious to secure our long-term recovery, prosperity and future competitiveness around the globe by making the needed investments in our roads, bridges, ports, broadband and clean energy.
