THE PRESIDENT said:
"I have tendered Mr. Nicholas Roosevelt an interim appointment as Vice Governor of the Philippines. Mr. Roosevelt has been so staunch in his support of the interests of the Philippine people and so sympathetic with them, so enthusiastic over their progress than I am sure that the misunderstanding which has arisen in the Philippines as to his attitude will be quickly cleared up."
