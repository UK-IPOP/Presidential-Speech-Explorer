Corporations don't need another tax break.
Powerful corporations try to game the tax system to pay as little as possible. And for far too long, American taxpayers have had to pick up the slack.
In a $160 billion deal, Pfizer is merging with Allergen to form the world's largest drug company—and they're moving their on-paper residence overseas to escape paying their fair share in U.S. taxes.
Corporations like Pfizer use so-called "inversions" to shortchange taxpayers by billions of dollars every year. And these loopholes put American workers and small businesses at a major disadvantage.
Hillary's plan will end the loopholes that reward companies for moving overseas and shift earnings abroad—and use the proceeds to reward the ones that invest here in the United States. It would charge a new "exit tax" for companies leaving the U.S. to settle up on their untaxed foreign earnings. And it will provide more support to American businesses—especially smaller manufacturers—so that they can compete.
