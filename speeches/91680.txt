 This pivotal Alliance, based on a long-shared history of standing together for freedom and democracy, is still growing stronger.
 The treaty will reduce barriers to the exchange of defense goods, services, and information between Australia and the United States, increasing interoperability and providing our forces with the most effective means to counter new threats. The Treaty will also help our respective defense industries share their rich technical expertise and increase collaboration and communication between the industries and armed forces.
 Shortly after September 11, Prime Minister Howard invoked the ANZUS Treaty's mutual defense provisions, deployed Australian troops to fight alongside American forces in the early combat phases in Afghanistan and Iraq. Australia has been an unwavering supporter of the War on Terror ever since. Australia now has more than 1,500 members of its armed forces committed to the war in Iraq and roughly 970 military personnel in Afghanistan.
