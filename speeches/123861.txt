Here is what I am at 
 with: whatever happens next, God will either give me the ability to get around it or the strength to go through it. I think that is also true for our country.

I cannot complain. My parents came here with nothing. They could have gone to any other country in the world. They came to the United States. I thank God for that. He has blessed me with four incredible children, and a loving and godly wife. I am a blessed person and I have been blessed to be part of this process. I am blessed to be standing here today. I am blessed every single one of you came. I am blessed that I have such great supporters as Neil, and Tim, and Trey. I am so blessed for me to complain about anything would truly be greedy.
I do feel great about our momentum and more importantly I feel optimistic about America. You know why? Because America is not a government. Our government is messed up. You are our country. And tomorrow morning â€” well, maybe not tomorrow morning because it is President's Day.

Tuesday morning, you are going to get up and go to work. You are going to raise your families. You are going to run your businesses. You are going to volunteer in your community. You are going to donate to charity. That is America. That is as great as it has ever been. Our government is messed up. We are going to fix that in 2016.
