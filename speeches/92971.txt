 "A study commissioned by the Hotel Association of the City of New York and the New York State Hospitality and Tourism Association found that the city is the highest-taxed destination in the country, at $23.74 per night, compared with $7.67 in other major cities. As a result, hoteliers and tourism officials say, the city is losing business, some of it just across the Hudson to hotels in New Jersey."

 "The [hotel] tax has annoyed various meeting planners to the extent that some are boycotting New York.

 "[O]ne month into being mayor of New York City I woke up on February first, 1994. I had the radio on and the announcer on the radio said, Mayor Giuliani has been in office one month and the Mayor has already set a record and I thought, that's nice I wonder what it is. He said he set a record for the most snow fall in the last 40 years and then the reporter went on to say. There's going to be more snow fall in February. … And the first couple of years I got a lot of snow. But I want to report something to you. By the time I finished as mayor, there was almost no snow in the winters, Republican policies and programs worked to even reduce the snow."
