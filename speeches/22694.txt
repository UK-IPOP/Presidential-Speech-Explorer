WE ARE GLAD to welcome all of the friends of Admiral Anderson and the friends of the Navy, a good many distinguished officers and former officers. We appreciate them all coming here on an occasion which is very meaningful to all of us.

I would like to ask the Secretary of the Navy to read the citation.
[At this point Secretary of the Navy Fred Korth read the citation. The President then resumed speaking.]
I want to take this opportunity to express my very strong personal appreciation to Admiral Anderson. He has been one of the military advisers to the President during the last 2 years, years which have been very difficult, sometimes dangerous, always challenging. And I have found his loyalty to his country, his good will towards all of us who work in the White House, and his willingness to take responsibility and to take it effectively to be--I know of no superior.
So I want to express my very warm appreciation to him for 2 very valuable years to our country and I think that he should take the greatest satisfaction in his ability, to have played an important part in the naval life of our country and in the general life of our country at a most significant time.
He goes now as our Ambassador to Portugal, a maritime power, a country with which we have had long and intimate relations, an ally in NATO, a country of great importance in the year 1963, and in the years to come. And, therefore, I think in a new field he has a chance to still serve his country in a most significant way.
So we say, thank you, Admiral, for what you have done in the past, an expression of appreciation for your willingness to assume new responsibilities for your country. And I think he is very much aided in his Ambassadorship by--the United States has really gotten two for one in this case--Mrs. Anderson. So we want to thank them both.
