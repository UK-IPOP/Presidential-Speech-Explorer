Chazz Silva, who is also from Nampa, is a first-time voter. Silva said he came to the rally for the experience of attending and to see if Rubio would stand out to him as a candidate. . . .

Silva said his vote has shifted to Rubio. Though he came into the rally an undecided voter, Silva said he is definitely planning to vote for Rubio.

"I was really impressed with what he had to say," Silva said. "I liked that he was very frank about everything and wasn't afraid to speak his mind."
Idaho Sen. Jim Risch introduced Rubio in Idaho Falls and Boise. Risch said he and Rubio "have spent hundreds of hours together working on national security matters," serving on the Senate Foreign Relations committee: "With Marco Rubio, you don't have to wait for the first day. He is ready today."

Risch also noted Rubio's support for nuclear energy and the Idaho National Laboratory. Rubio also has the backing of Idaho State Controller Brandon Woolf.

Rubio "knows this is the flagship lab for nuclear energy in America, and he wants to keep it that way," Risch said in Idaho Falls, adding that Cruz has said he wants to eliminate the U.S. Department of Energy.
