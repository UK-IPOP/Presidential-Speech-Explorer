H.R. 10139, entitled "An act for the relief of Edmund F. Hubbard" is hereby returned without my approval. Attached hereto is a letter from the Secretary of War giving reasons why the bill ought not to become a law. If this bill stood alone it might not be of enough importance to warrant adverse action on the part of the President. It is one of a considerable number of bills which have been passed, two of which have already reached me. These cases for reinstatement involve the review of very careful action which is always taken when men are retired or discharged from the Army, and I can see no reason for passing special bills for relief of this kind.
