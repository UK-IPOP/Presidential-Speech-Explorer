THE CONGRESS has significantly enlarged both the authority and the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration in recent years. The magnitude and the complexity of its responsibilities are of concern to every American.
Shortly after taking office last fall, Secretary Gardner initiated a thorough reappraisal of the Food and Drug Administration's organizational problems and a far-reaching search for a new Commissioner. Dr. Goddard has earned wide recognition for his administrative skill and his scientific competence. I share Secretary Gardner's confidence that Dr. Goddard will bring to his new assignment the quality of leadership that will enable the Food and Drug Administration to fully meet its vast and varied responsibilities for consumer protection.
