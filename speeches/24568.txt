Dear Commissioner Tobriner:
Thank you for your letter of March 31, 1966, transmitting the statement of the Policy Advisory Committee on the plans for interstate freeways within the District of Columbia, and advising me that the Board of Commissioners has endorsed the statement of the Committee.
The Committee's decision to seek the aid of a consultant, and its unanimous statement following the consultant's report, are reassuring to me and will be reassuring to the Congress and the citizens of the District of Columbia. This review demonstrates that freeways, which the District must have, can and will be located and constructed in ways that reflect all significant community needs and values. I hope that the necessary funds will speedily be made available.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON

[Hon. Walter N. Tobriner, President, Board of Commissioners, District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.]
