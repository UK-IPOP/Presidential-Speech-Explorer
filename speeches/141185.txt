The 
 that unemployment would only fall to 9.3% by the end of the year. The 
 unemployment would hover at 16% in the third quarter. Even Joe Biden 
 that the economy would bounce back anytime soon. Yet President Trump's economic leadership has defied the experts yet again: 


It's now undeniable that President Trump's stewardship of the economy is delivering incredible results. Under President Trump's leadership, the economy has added back an amazing 10.6 million jobs over the past four months â€“ nearly half of all of the jobs lost due to the global coronavirus pandemic from China. Unemployment fell for all groups of Americans, including Hispanics, Black Americans, women, and veterans. 


With every stellar jobs report, it becomes increasingly clear that Joe Biden has no idea what he is talking about. 
 Biden said he would shut down the economy again, despite mounting evidence that Americans can both be safe and get back to work at the same time. Biden would cripple the recovery by raising taxes on the middle class, instituting crushing mandates on small businesses, and killing jobs with a radical War on American-Made Energy.

President Trump is the only candidate who will America on the path back to economic prosperity. He built the best economy in American history once before, and now he is doing it again.
