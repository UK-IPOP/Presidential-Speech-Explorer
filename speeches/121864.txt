We are honored to be here today to present the work of hundreds of volunteers from across the Commonwealth to place Marco Rubio on the ballot for the March 1 Primary. These volunteers responded to Marco's positive message for a strong and prosperous America whose best years are ahead. The fact that we did not pay for a single signature speaks volumes about the grassroots support for Marco and his vision for a New American Century.
Glad that 
 will be on the 
 primary ballot. His grassroots presence has been very impressive this cycle.
