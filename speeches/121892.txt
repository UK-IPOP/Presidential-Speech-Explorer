You support Marco from your living room every time he steps on the debate stage â€” but there's a lot you can't see on your TV screen.
During a commercial break, I saw Marco walk over to a stage hand and commend him on a job well-done. It was a moment of gratitude and humility that spoke volumes to me of Marco's character and appreciation for the hard-working men and women who make America great.
It's something I saw only because I was there to watch the debate in person . . . and YOU could do the same for the next debate on Dec. 15th in Las Vegas.
