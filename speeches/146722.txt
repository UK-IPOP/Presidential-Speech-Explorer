Good morning everyone,
the rain finally stopped, it's nice and sunny here at the White House. I'll be your pooler for the VP's booster shot. The Vice President is scheduled to receive her booster of the Moderna vaccine at 11:25am in the South Court. There is no other event on today's schedule.
The VP entered the room at 11:37am. She sat on a chair in the middle of the auditorium and received her shot from a member of the White House Medical Unit. Harris spoke for two ministers afterwards. She encouraged everyone to get the shot „when you are eligible". „What we have said from the beginning: It's safe and free." She left the room at 11:39 am.
Here is the visual proof from my twitter account of the VP getting her third dose.

The VP also said: „What we know at this point in our country, the vast majority (..) well over 90 percent of the people in an ICU or dying from Covid are unvaccinated. So let's get vaccinated and we will get through the pandemic."
Have a great Saturday!
