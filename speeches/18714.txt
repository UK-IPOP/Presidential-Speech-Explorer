THE PRESIDENT of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Legion of Merit to
CAPTAIN EDWARD L. BEACH, UNITED STATES NAVY
for services as Commanding Officer of the U.S.S. TRITON during the first submerged voyage around the world.
CITATION:
For exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding service while serving on board the U.S.S. Triton from the 16th of February 1960 to the 10th of May 1960. As Commanding Officer, Captain Edward L. Beach, U.S. Navy, led his crew with courage, foresight and determination in an unprecedented circumnavigation of the globe, proving man's ability under trying conditions to accomplish prolonged submerged missions as well as testing new and complex equipment in the world's largest submarine. This historic voyage took his ship into strange waters under difficult and frequently unknown conditions, as a result, the Triton collected much valuable oceanographic information. Captain Beach's sound judgment, masterful leadership, professional skill and devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the naval service.
