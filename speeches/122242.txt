The Rubio campaign announced Huizenga's endorsement Tuesday and the formation of a leadership team in Michigan ahead of a Dec. 9 fundraiser the senator will attend in Bloomfield Hills.

"Marco's plan for a new American economy will create good paying jobs here in Michigan and strengthen our nation's economy," said Huizenga, R-Zeeland, in a statement. "I look forward to helping Marco win Michigan."
