"The Obama-Biden team can't seem to get their story straight on the nation's struggling economy. After his advisers first promised to drive down unemployment to 5.3% by today, Vice President Biden last night claimed he doesn't know how long it will take to get to 6%. The truth is Americans can't afford four more years like the last four years. As president, Mitt Romney will finally deliver a real recovery, with 12 million new jobs and higher take-home pay for American workers." — Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 RADDATZ: "Can you get unemployment to under 6 percent, and how long will it take?" BIDEN: "I don't know how long it will take." RADDATZ: "Vice President Biden." BIDEN: We can and we will get it under 6 percent." (Vice President Joe Biden, Vice Presidential Debate, Danville, KY, 10/11/12)

 BIDEN: "This is a monumental project, but I think it's doable. But I just think we got to stay on top of it and we got to stay on top of it on a weekly basis. Because this is about getting this out and spent in 18 months to create 3.5 million jobs and do -- to set -- tee this up so the rest of the good work that's being done here literally drop-kicks us out of this recession and we begin to grow again and begin to grow again." (Vice President Joe Biden,
