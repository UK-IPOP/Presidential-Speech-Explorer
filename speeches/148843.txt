 Mr. President, what would you like to say to European partners? What would you like to say to European partners?
 I'm going to say that to their face. I'm going to say—all I have to say, I'm going to say when I get there.
But I'll be happy to talk to you guys when I get back or—how many—are you coming?
They're there. They're there.

 I know. [

 Will you convey your message—will you convey the message for Vladimir Putin?
Mr. President, how concerned—how concerned are you about the threat of chemical warfare right now, that Russia will use chemical weapons? How high is that threat?
 I think it's a real threat.
Thank you. Thanks.
 Mr. President, Mr. President——
