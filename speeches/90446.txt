 â€“ At a press conference today in Nashville, Tennessee, Senator John Edwards will announce his plan to revitalize rural America through a "Rural Recovery Act."

We need to help small towns and rural communities create and keep new businesses and good jobs, and we need a President who will make sure all our communities have good schools, good health care and the support systems they need. As President, I will make sure rural America is never left behind."
As a native of a small rural town, Edwards understands the values of rural America.

Today, many rural areas are struggling to prosper: rural families earn 27 percent less than other families, family farms are struggling and rural manufacturing has been hit hard by international trade and offshoring of jobs. Edwards will help bring rural communities back to life by reinvigorating their economies and helping struggling communities improve their schools, health care and other essential services.
