THE UNITED STATES Government is ready and willing to go to the Security Council for a full discussion of the Soviets wanton shooting down of the United States Air force RB-47 airplane in international waters July 1.
This Government itself had contemplated recourse to the Security Council but only after trying the bi-lateral remedies specified in the United Nations Charter. The United States has in fact proposed in its note of July 12 to the Soviet Government that a joint investigation be made. The Soviet Government has ignored the provisions of the Charter which call upon the parties to an international dispute to attempt to settle their differences by negotiation or similar means prior to any action within the United Nations itself.
The United States will focus attention in the Security Council on the lawless actions and reckless threats of the Soviet Government.
