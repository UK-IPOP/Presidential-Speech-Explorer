[Released August 21, 1931. Dated August 13, 1931]
My dear General Cumming:
In order to assemble the entire picture of the unemployment relief problem I should like to know what the Public Health results show as to the success or failure of the organization during the past winter in relieving distress.
Therefore I would be greatly obliged if you would furnish me with such data as you have on the comparative state of the public health during the period of maximum burden of distress and relief--that is, in the early months of 1931--as compared with, say, similar months in 1928, a period of full employment. You will, of course, need to consider the effect of the irregular factors introduced by epidemics. I mention this as long experience has taught me that if there is any lowering of vitality in any section of the population, it might result in certain types of epidemics.
Generally, the final test of success or failure in efforts to meet physical distress is in the relative volume of sickness or death, and I would be glad to know what this test, applied to the last winter, shows

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
