 First of all, the Prime Minister and I would like to thank Priscilla and Lisa for their gracious hospitality. And we thank the Graceland staff as well for arranging this unusual experience. First of all, my presence here shows it's never too late to come to Graceland. Laura and I are—we've known Elvis Presley since we were growing up. He's obviously a major part of our music history. He had an international reputation. His reputation was so strong that he attracted the attention of the now Prime Minister of Japan.
I was hoping the Prime Minister would want to come to Graceland. I knew he loved Elvis; I didn't realize how much he loved Elvis. He not only knows Elvis's history, he can sing a pretty good Elvis song. This visit here shows that not only am I personally fond of the Prime Minister, but the ties between our peoples are very strong as well.
And so, again, to the Presleys, thank you all. And Mr. Prime Minister, glad you joined us. Want to say a few comments?
 It's like a dream. I never expected Mr. President come with me to visit Graceland. There's Elvis song: "To Dream Impossible." [
