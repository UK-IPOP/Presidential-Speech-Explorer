Mr. Prime Minister:
As you leave the White House--and you are not leaving the country yet, because we hope you will stay here for a few more days--I want you to know how grateful I am for your returning to the United States after having been here at the time of President Eisenhower's funeral, and for giving us the opportunity to have a very full discussion of the major issues that are not really between us so much as they involve our common interests for peace and security in the Pacific area.
This talk has been most helpful, as far as I am concerned, and as far as the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense are concerned. We have opened a line of communication which will be used very extensively in the months and years ahead in pursuing our mutual purposes and goals in the world.
I want to say, finally, that as one who has been to your country on two occasions, I hope to visit there again. And, like all Americans, I have a very deep personal feeling of respect for your country, for your people, and for the leadership that you have provided for your people.
We are very proud to have been your allies and friends in great struggles in the past and to be your allies and friends as we deal with the problems of the future.
