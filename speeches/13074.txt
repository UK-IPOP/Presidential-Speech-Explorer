[ Released March 4, 1948. Dated March 3, 1948 ]
My dear General Fleming:
Thank you for your timely letter pointing out the danger that the Disaster Surplus Property Program may not provide adequate relief to stricken communities in the future.
This matter has been on my mind as I have watched the disposal of surplus property held by the War Assets Administration.
I am gratified to know that you are studying this problem and I want to thank you for your consistent efforts to coordinate disaster relief. We should now give consideration to making a permanent arrangement for disaster relief.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Major General Philip B. Fleming, Administrator, Federal Works Agency, Washington 25, D.C.]
