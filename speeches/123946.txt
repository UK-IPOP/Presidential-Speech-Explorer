We thank Senator Rubio for consistently voting to uphold the fundamentals of faith, family and freedom. Senator Rubio voted to repeal key parts of Obamacare, protect the unborn, end the forced partnership between taxpayers and Planned Parenthood, and protect state marriage laws before the Supreme Court changed the [natural] definition of marriage.
We can be encouraged by elected officials who are willing to be criticized by some in the media and the intolerant voices of secularism as they stand for family values. Congress as a whole is often criticized, and rightfully so, but there are individual Senators, like Senator Rubio, who deserve praise for their unwavering commitment to stand for life, family, marriage, and religious liberty.
Family Research Council Action and the hundreds of thousands of families we represent are proud to recognize Senator Rubio for his faithful work. Our hope is that in the next Congress, he will be joined by many more like him.
