Just over a month after launching his campaign for President, Jeb made a visit to Silicon Valley, the tech capital of the world. The visit was fitting for a man 
the "eGovernor." A man who 
 his blackberry make it into his official portrait. And a man who now wears an Apple Watch to check Twitter throughout the day.
The Governor embraced the Silicon Valley experience in full.
He kicked off the trip by setting the record straight on his tech favorites, noting he now prefers the iPhone to the Blackberry:
Next, he launched a LinkedIn profile, joining as a LinkedIn Influencer, an invite-only group comprised of ~500 of the world's top thought leaders. He published a post on the site called "Disrupting Washington to Unleash Innovators."
Then, Jeb said "no" to the local government taxi cab cartel and "yes" to Uber.

The Uber dropped him off at a San Francisco startup company called Thumbtack, an online marketplace that helps connect local service providers with potential clients. Jeb toured the company, spoke with its employees, and answered a number of questions.
Appropriately, the event was Periscoped by Carla Marinucci, a political reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle. Jeb used to email with her when he was Governor.

  15 years indeed (!) since you sent me that letter talking about how internet is revolutionizing politics

Throughout the day, Jeb's message was clear: In order to unleash the vast potential of America's innovators, we must disrupt Washington. Companies like Thumbtack and Uber cause mental dissonance for people — like Hillary Clinton — who think they can plan the future of the economy from Washington D.C.
A full day in Silicon Valley. Done the right way.
