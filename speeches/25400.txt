ALL OF US have been deeply impressed by Lt. Col. Aleksey Leonov's feat in becoming the first man to leave a spaceship in outer space and return safely. I take pleasure, Mr. Chairman, in offering on behalf of the people of the United States sincere congratulations and best wishes to the cosmonauts and the scientists and all the others responsible for this outstanding accomplishment.
