[Released June 18, 1930. Dated June 6, 1930]
I SEND cordial greetings to those present at the "American Hour" of the World Power Conference in Berlin. The imagination is stirred by the ever-widening field of knowledge and its practical application in the multiplying instruments of service to mankind. Civilized society depends in ever increasing degree upon the spirit of inquiry and the utilization of scientific truth. Those who serve this cause serve the best interests of the race.
