 — In a 
 released today, 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul vaults to second place in New Hampshire among likely Republican primary voters, with 17 percent of the vote.
"We're very excited to see these numbers," said Ron Paul 2012 National Campaign Chairman Jesse Benton. "While other campaigns have shot into the top tier, only to fade away, support for Congressman Paul in New Hampshire has been growing steadily, and we are prepared to hold our ground here — and advance."
The New Hampshire figures come on the heels of a 
 showing Paul in a statistical tie for first place in Iowa, and a 
 in which he was the only Republican candidate to best Obama among independent voters (48 to 39%).
