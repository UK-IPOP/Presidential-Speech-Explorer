 Good morning, everybody.
 Happy birthday.
 That's the way we like it, up and early.
 We do too. [

 Up and at 'em. Feeling a little older, if you know what I mean.
David [David Gregory, NBC News], how are you, lad?
 All right. Sir, now that you're a little older and wiser, are you rethinking avoiding spending all of August here?
 No, I think—I think you'll like Crawford.
 It's warmer there.
 Do you have any words of wisdom for him on the vacation schedule?
 I've got words of wisdom for Eric. He ought to get out of there.
 Get out of there, Eric. [

 What does your hat say?
 That's French. [

 I was going to sing for you in another language.
 Thank you, sir. That's an inside joke.
[
]
 No laughing about the ladies' tee.
 Sir, what do you want for your birthday?
 I don't know yet. I haven't thought about it. First of all, I'm glad— I'm glad my mother and wife remembered. [

[
]
 Yes, Mr. President. Nice, gentle applause rippling throughout the gallery.
See you in a couple hours—like 2.
[
]
 I apologize.
 Yes, right.
 Miserable shot.
 You didn't have any idea where we were, either, did you?
 It's clear I didn't have any idea where the ball was going——
 Mr. President, it's up by the tree, sir.
 Who kicked it under there? [
]
 David did. [
]
 I was just kidding about the French thing. [
