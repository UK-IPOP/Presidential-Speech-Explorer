YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS, one of the most highly respected and esteemed organizations of our country is the National Geographic Society.
For me it is a very great privilege to act as their representative in presenting to you this Medal, so well earned for the reasons given in the Citation, and particularly because you are here on a state visit to our country and as the personal friend of so many Americans--among whom I proudly number myself.
So it is a very great pleasure to hand you this, on behalf of the Society, and my congratulations.
