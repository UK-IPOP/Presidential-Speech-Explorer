I WANT to call your attention to those two citations--among the most remarkable I have ever read, and I have furnished more of these medals to these brave young men than any other President, due to the fact that the other Presidents didn't have the same situation to face that these young men and the Government of the United States have had to face.
Wouldn't it be a wonderful thing if in our civil affairs we had fighters for the right like these two young men.
I hope that their example will be enough to cause more people to take the responsibility for government that they should take, and to fight for the right as these two young men fought for liberty and the welfare of the world.
