My dear Commander Byrd:
On this second anniversary of your transatlantic flight to France, I wish personally and upon behalf of the Nation to congratulate you and [p.204] your gallant comrades upon that triumph of courage and skill over the resisting forces of Nature, and to wish you all success in your present similar conquests of the Antarctic.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
