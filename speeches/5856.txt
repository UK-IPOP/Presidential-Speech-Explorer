I transmit herewith, for the information of the Congress, reports rendered in connection with the investigation to determine the extent and value of the coal deposits in and under the segregated coal lands of the Choctaw and Chickasaw nations in Oklahoma, which investigation has been made, under the direction of the Department of the interior, pursuant to the act of June 21, 1906, which provides in part as follows:
That the Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized and directed to make practical and exhaustive investigation of the character, extent, and value of the coal deposits in and under the segregated coal lands of the Choctaw and Chickasaw nations, in Indian Territory; and the expense thereof, not exceeding the sum of fifty thousand dollars, shall be paid out of the funds of the Choctaw and Chickasaw nations in the Treasury of the United States: 
 , That any and all information obtained under the provisions of this act shall be available at all times for the use of the Congress and its committees.
There are also inclosed memorials of the Choctaw Nation protesting against the payment of the expenses of this investigation from the tribal funds, and requesting the United States to purchase the surplus and undivided property of the Choctaw and Chickasaw nations.
