 the serious problems of national defense now confronting this country demand the utmost attention to the conservation of our human and physical resources; and
 the lives of thousands of persons were lost and property damage of more than a quarter of a billion dollars occurred during the year 1940 as a result of avoidable fires in the United States; and
 individual responsibility for protecting human life and safeguarding homes, industries, and public buildings against this grave menace should be impressed upon the entire citizenry:
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning October 5, 1941, as Fire Prevention Week, and I urge public authorities, civic bodies, educators, the press, and the radio to emphasize the dangers attendant upon fires in the present national emergency, and I recommend to all our citizens their active cooperation in the elimination of fire hazards and their prompt action in every situation threatening loss of life or property by fire.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 3rd day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-sixth.
FRANKLIN D ROOSEVELT
