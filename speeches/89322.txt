"Our ability to compete in the 21st century depends upon educating [our] children... As Presidential Scholars, you leave your high school with confidence in your ability, and you've got a great foundation for success. We want to make sure that same confidence is instilled in every single child that's getting out of high school. And so what can we do? First, we can make sure No Child Left Behind gets reauthorized."
 The United States Presidential Scholars Program was established in 1964 to recognize and honor some of our Nation's most distinguished graduating high school seniors. At least one young man and one young woman are selected from each state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and U.S. families abroad.
 The study also found that minority and low-income students are making some of the biggest gains â€“ and as a result, the achievement gap is beginning to close.
