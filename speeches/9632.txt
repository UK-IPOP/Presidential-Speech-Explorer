My dear Mr. Mayor:
I regret that earlier commitments make it impossible for me to attend the celebration in Philadelphia of the 250th Anniversary of William Penn. The influence of his benevolent spirit and his idealistic faith has grown with time, and has been a potent force for peace, right dealing and progress in the State which he rounded. I share in spirit the reverence being paid to his memory, and I ask you to greet for me all those who take part in this observance.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Honorable J. Hampton Moore, Mayor, Philadelphia, Pa.]
