Today, "more than 75 organizations representing patients, consumers, seniors, unions, small businesses, employers, physicians, nurses, and disease advocacy and human rights organizations," wrote a letter to Congress "urging the Senate to immediately pass the Inflation Reduction Act."

In this letter, these organizations point out that "rising prices are a 
 for American families and employers. Undeterred by the financial hardship and health challenges facing Americans today as a result of the pandemic, drug companies have already raised the prices of their products 
 in the first seven months of the year — more than in the same period in 2020 and 2021." To address this concern, among others, the Inflation Reduction Act would require Medicare to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical corporations for lower drug prices, discourage drug companies from increasing their prices faster than the rate of inflation, and cap annual out-of-pocket costs for Medicare beneficiaries at $2,000.



Dear Members of Congress,

Congress can make history in the next week by passing the most expansive and powerful reforms to help Americans afford prescription drugs since enactment of the Medicare Part D benefit in 2003. On behalf of more than 75 organizations representing patients, consumers, seniors, unions, small businesses, employers, physicians, nurses, and disease advocacy and human rights organizations, we urge the Senate to immediately pass the Inflation Reduction Act.

The legislation is truly historic because for the first time ever it will:

In a time of great division in our nation this legislation has overwhelmingly bipartisan support. 
 of Republicans, Democrats, and independents back each of these reforms, which have consistently been the 
 element under discussion for reconciliation.

Congress can pass these drug pricing reforms before the August recess and move the nation in anew direction, providing savings to patients, taxpayers, workers, and employers. 
 savings of almost $300 billion to the Federal government alone.

Rising prices are a 
 for American families and employers. Undeterred by the financial hardship and health challenges facing Americans today as a result of the pandemic, drug companies have already raised the prices of their products 
 in the first seven months of the year — more than in the same period in 2020 and 2021.



Congress can make history in the next week. Pass the Inflation Reduction Act and send it to the President for his signature. Not only will it break the pharmaceutical industry's unilateral power to dictate prices to the American people, it will save lives, improve health, curb the impact of inflation, and put more money back into the pockets of American seniors, workers, and businesses.

Congress has repeatedly promised to address this problem, and the American people need the help now more than ever.
