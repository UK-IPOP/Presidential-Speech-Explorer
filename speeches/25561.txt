A SIGNIFICANT milestone in cooperative international space efforts was achieved yesterday with the successful launching of the Italian San Marco satellite.
This marks the first time a launch crew of any nation other than the United States or the Soviet Union has put its own scientific payload into orbit.
My congratulations to the Italian people for their initiative and perseverance in the San Marco project. It is a source of particular satisfaction to me that I participated in the signing of the Italian-American agreement for this project in Rome in 1962.
I look forward to continued success in the next phase of the San Marco project when the Italian Space Commission will attempt the difficult operation of launching a similar satellite from an ocean platform near the equator.
