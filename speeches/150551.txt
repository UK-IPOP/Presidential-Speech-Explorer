Good afternoon from the White House –

The air outside is roughly the temperature and consistency of cafeteria gravy, and your pooler has been tested and is awaiting the call to gather for President Biden's (remote) signing of the "PPP and Bank Fraud Enforcement Harmonization Act of 2022."

Here is today's full schedule:

 Signing of the PPPABFEHA (acronym assumed)

 Press briefing

For planning purposes, heavy rain and thunderstorms are expected later this afternoon, so remember to bring an umbrella and stay safe! 


Your pooler, a photographer and the wire pooler (no TV pool and no pre-credentialed press, as initially stated and as is usual) are being escorted ahead of President Biden’s signing of the two loan fraud bills, which will not be held in the South Court Auditorium (as initially stated). The signing is scheduled for 1 p.m. Eastern and will be livestreamed here: 
 


Restricted pool (wire, photog, TV and your truly) are on-site on the Blue Room Balcony. The signing will be livestreamed here: 
 


Once more, with feeling: 
 


President Biden concluded his remarks at 1.28 p.m.

Asked from the pool about Brittney Griner, he responded: "I'm working hard and I'm hopeful."

The president did not respond to (and may not have heard) other questions from the restricted pool shouted from the Red Room.

In your pooler’s opinion, there was room in the Red Room — if not an abundance of fantastic vantage points — for the full pool to have covered the remarks. 


The briefing ended at 3.14 p.m. Eastern. 


A lid was called at 3.35 p.m. Eastern — have a great weekend!
