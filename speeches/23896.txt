Memorandum for:

The Secretary of Commerce

The Secretary of Labor

The Director, Bureau of the Budget

The Administrator of General Services Administration

The Special Assistant to the President for Cabinet and Departmental Relations

The Chairman, National Capital Planning Commission
I have reviewed the report of the Ad Hoc Committee on federal Office Space. This report provides a long-needed perspective on federal office space problems and prospects in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.
I am requesting each department and agency head to give immediate study to the report and take appropriate action. Future planning for the acquisition and use of office space is to be guided by the findings and recommendations of this report.
I will appreciate a progress report one year from now by the Administrator of General Services with regard to federal office space and the adoption of improved architectural standards. I should like a similar report on progress from the Chairman of the National Capital Planning Commission with regard to the improvement of Pennsylvania Avenue.
