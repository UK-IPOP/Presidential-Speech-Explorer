Greetings from Wilmington, where there was a parade this morning to celebrate the fire department's 100th anniversary.
The pool was tested for Covid-19, gathered at 10:30 a.m. and had our bags and equipment swept the following hour.
The pool is now with the presidential motorcade, which began rolling at 12:46 p.m.
The motorcade stopped at St. Andrew's School at 1:49 p.m.
Your pooler did not spot President Biden but can see a crowd gathered in the distance from where the press is holding.
The White House informs us that the president and the first lady are attending their granddaughter Natalie Biden's field hockey game. St. Andrews is playing Tower Hill.
The motorcade began rolling from St. Andrew's School at 2:58 p.m.
The motorcade dropped President Biden and first lady Jill Biden off at their residence at 3:37 p.m.
The motorcade began rolling again from the Biden residence at 5:03 p.m.
The once light rain here in Wilmington has begun to pick up.
The motorcade stopped at St. Joseph on the Brandywine Roman Catholic Church at 5:07 p.m.
The pool is holding in a bus nearby.
President Biden exited the church at 5:49 p.m.
Outside, the gray clouds have cleared up, the precipitation has stopped and the motorcade is now on the move again, as of 5:51 p.m.
After a short trip, President Biden is back at his residence. The motorcade dropped him off at 5:58 p.m., and the White House has called a travel/photo lid.
Enjoy the rest of your night.
