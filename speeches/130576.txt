Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Lisa Monaco today met with British Deputy National Security Advisor Patrick McGuinness and French Presidential Military Advisor Bernard Rogel, her British and French counterparts, respectively. They discussed counterterrorism cooperation, including the status of our campaign against ISIL and the threat posed by terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction. Throughout the course of the meetings, Ms. Monaco noted that the British and French are our closest and most effective partners in bringing pressure against terrorist groups that would threaten Western interests, united by common values and shared aims. The officials reviewed our collective efforts to address the threat from terrorist groups in Iraq, Syria, Libya, and the Sahel and underscored our shared determination to deliver a lasting defeat to ISIL.
