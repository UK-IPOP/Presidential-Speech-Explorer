TO ALL THOSE, of whatever nationality, who participated in the rescue operations following the tragic collision between the Andrea Doria and the Stockholm, I extend personal congratulations and admiration.
The speed with which rescue craft arrived on the scene and the efficient manner in which rescue operations were placed under way saved the lives of many of the passengers and crew of the Andrea Doria. Without such assistance, the tragic toll of life from the accident would have been much higher.
The rescue work was conducted in the finest tradition of maritime service.
