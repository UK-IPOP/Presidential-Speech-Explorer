Each year since taking office, President Donald J. Trump has welcomed hundreds of business owners and workers from every State to display their unique, American-made products at the annual Made in America Showcase.

The President extends his sincere appreciation to the companies that planned to attend this year's event at the White House today. He is incredibly proud of their grit, ingenuity, and use of American labor to manufacture exceptional products on the homeland.

President Trump remains steadfastly committed to implementing policies that put American workers first and allow businesses across the United States to thrive.
