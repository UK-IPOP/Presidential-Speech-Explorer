 â€“ Cruz for President today released an online video featuring Oklahoma Congressman Jim Bridenstine (and current Major in the Oklahoma Air National Guard) who shares the truth about Ted Cruz's record of defending America's national security and points out that Marco Rubio's Gang of Eight bill would have weakened border security and given President Obama authority to expand admission of Syrian refugees.


"I have watched Ted Cruz boldly stand against president Obama's appeasement of those who would threaten our security, from Iran to ISIS to Russia," Congressman Bridenstine says in the video. "Further, I have seen Ted Cruz stand up to both Obama and Marco Rubio, when they joined forces to provide amnesty without border security. The Rubio amnesty bill would have expanded the U.S. Refugee Resettlement Program and given Obama authority to admit even more Syrian refugees."
Bridenstine continues, "Ted Cruz will rebuild our military, take the fight to radical Islamic terrorists, and never apologize for America. He will use every tool we have to win, but he will never betray the very Constitution we are sworn to defend."
