I am thrilled that these conservative elected officials are joining with me to support the most electable conservative in this race: Marco Rubio.
Marco understands the struggles of working families because he's lived them, and we are proud to be working with him to help all people in Arkansas and across the nation achieve the American Dream.
I am happy to join my colleagues here today in supporting Marco Rubio's leadership team in Arkansas. In the coming days, we will take Marco's positive message of a New American Century to our constituents, neighbors and friends and let them know why Marco can beat Hillary Clinton in November and move America in a conservative direction.
