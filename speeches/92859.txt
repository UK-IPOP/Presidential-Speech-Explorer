The California Hillary Clinton for President Campaign today announced over 20 statewide educational leaders who are supporting Hillary Clinton for President. They cite her commitment to quality education from universal pre-kindergarten to making college more accessible and affordable as reasons for their backing.
"Hillary is the most qualified candidate to improve our education system, and as President she will use that experience to create a better future for our children," said State Superintendent of Public Instruction Jack O'Connell. "She has strong and sensible plans and I believe she is the candidate who can deliver the real change our education system needs."
"I am honored to have the support of these community leaders who have devoted their lives to enriching our children," said Senator Clinton. "Every child deserves the opportunity to live up to their potential and a high quality education system is essential to achieving that goal."
As an advocate, First Lady, and United States Senator, Hillary has fought to raise the education standards in our nation's schools. Hillary is committed to reforming No Child Left Behind (NCLB). In addition to fighting for full funding for NCLB, she is working to ensure the legislation supports early childhood education, improves teacher training, lowers class size, enhances parental involvement, eliminates environmental hazards in schools, and protects the programs that work for America's children.
