THE PRESIDENT said:
"I am issuing today the unanimous report of the Commission on Muscle Shoals. This Commission was appointed to recommend methods for the disposal of Muscle Shoals and consists of three members each appointed by the legislatures and Governors of the States of Alabama and Tennessee, together with one member from the Engineer Corps, one from the Judge Advocate General's office and one from the agricultural organizations.
"The Commission has made a 4-months' intensive study of the subject, has had many public hearings at which all interested parties have been encouraged to send representatives. It is a representative body and its conclusions speak for themselves. At an appropriate time I shall transmit the report to the Congress."
