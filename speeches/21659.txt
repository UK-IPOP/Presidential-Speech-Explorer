Senator John F. Kennedy today declared that--

  the midyear budget report shows our fiscal stake in full employment.
Rising unemployment and slack business conditions will cause a loss of at least $2 billion in anticipated revenue--
Kennedy said.

  The failure of corporate profits to rise and the consequent loss of expected corporate tax collections has caused a substantial change in the budget picture.
The $2-billion loss of budgeted revenue would have fully financed the Democratic program of Federal aid to education, the Democratic housing program, and the Democratic program for area redevelopment; a return to conditions of full employment will mean not only more jobs, but also greater revenue to the Government.
By revising downward their estimate of revenues, the mid-year budget report has officially admitted the current state of stagnation in our economy. The time has come to elect an administration committed to a policy of full employment.
