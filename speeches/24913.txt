Dear Mr. President: (Dear Mr. Speaker:)
I am transmitting to the Congress herewith a proposed Joint Resolution "To provide for the administration and development of Pennsylvania Avenue as a National Historic Site".
Increasing concern with the shabby condition of Pennsylvania Avenue--the Nation's most distinguished and historic thoroughfare-led to the appointment by President Kennedy of the Council on Pennsylvania Avenue, which devoted almost two years to the preparation of plans for its rejuvenation. The work thus started has been carried forward by a Temporary Commission on Pennsylvania Avenue, created by Executive Order No. 11210 on March 25, 1965. The Temporary Commission recommended as the next appropriate steps the designation of the Avenue as a National Historic Site and the proposed Joint Resolution.
The proposed Joint Resolution will provide for the administration and development of the Avenue as a National Historic Site through a Commission on Pennsylvania Avenue. The Commission is to carry forward the work of the Temporary Commission and to coordinate activities along the Avenue, including Federal or District projects in the area.
That Pennsylvania Avenue will be redeveloped is inevitable. We must be sure that this development will be of a character worthy of this historic axis, which has from the beginning linked the Capitol and the White House. The proposed Joint Resolution will be a substantial step toward this goal. I hope it will have favorable consideration from the Congress.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
