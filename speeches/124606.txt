I'm proud to support Marco Rubio for president. As I speak to fellow conservatives in Georgia it's been impossible to ignore the growing enthusiasm for Marco Rubio's campaign, and I am glad to expand our team today.

For the first time in a long time, even many young Americans and disaffected voters have a true conservative candidate that can connect with them about the challenges they face. With Marco Rubio as America's next president, the future will be very bright.
I'm proud to support the only candidate in this race who has the experience and record of judgement to keep our people safe.

America needs a leader with the courage to roll back the disastrous foreign policy of Barack Obama, which has done so much damage to America's standing around the world. Marco Rubio has the strength to restore our military might, destroy ISIS, protect Israel, and secure our homeland. I'm excited to join his effort to build a New American Century.
When Marco Rubio talks about the American Dream, he speaks from experience. He knows what it's like to come from a family without wealth or power and to achieve success.

Marco wants to ensure that it's still possible in this century for my kids and your kids to go as far as their talent and work will take them. That is what this election is all about â€” restoring the American Dream. That's why I decided to support Marco Rubio and why I hope others will too.
