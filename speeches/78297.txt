 Good morning. I'll see you all at the school.
 Uh-oh, what does that mean?
 In Crawford.
 For what?
 You're going to drop by?
 I'm going to drop by the school after, so we'll have a little chance to visit then, to thank them for letting you all stay at the elementary school. Obviously, nobody told you.
 Thanks for the heads up.
 We're going to have an impromptu stop. I will decide on my way home to stop by the school. [

Roland Betts, my good friend from New York City.
Let's go. Hit them up.
And we'll—we can have a little visit there, if you like. That way, it won't ruin my golf game. [

 Looking forward to your game?
 Yes, I'm looking forward to getting out here.
Had a nice visit with Mitch Daniels this morning.
 He down here?
 No, I called him.
 Is that a Masters souvenir, your glove?
 I think somebody must have sent me that. I haven't been there in a while. Beautiful course.
All right, excuse me.

 So, I won't be a professional golfer.
 I'm going to go find that ball. I'm going to find that one.
 The first one? If you can find that first one, you're a pretty good bird-dog. [

Is everybody enjoying themselves here?
 I only just got here, so——
 Yes, I know. Where have you been?
 Sucking up the salt air on the west coast.
 Brie and cheese?
 No, tennis.
 Okay.
