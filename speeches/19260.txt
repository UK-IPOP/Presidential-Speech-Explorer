Dear Mr. President:
I much appreciate your message of November eighteenth and share your hope that the National Advisory Committee for Inter-American Affairs will contribute positively to peace and understanding in this hemisphere, and to the economic betterment envisaged by Operation Pan America. The assessment of problems and needs which now is being undertaken by the Organization of American States at the request of eleven American nations will provide, I am confident, the cornerstone on which Operation Pan America can build to achieve its objectives.
May I take this opportunity to thank you for your personal greetings. I wish for you and the people of Brazil the very best of health and success. Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
