Dear Mr. Justice:
I have your letter concerning your situation in relation to the work of the Commission on Civil Rights.
Under the circumstances, I must respect the reasons you give for being unable to serve as a Member of the Commission. Nevertheless, I appreciate your interest in its work and the extensive consideration you have given to it.
With warm regard,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
