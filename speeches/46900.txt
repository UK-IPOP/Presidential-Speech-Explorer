While the Administration supports the extension of Price-Anderson nuclear liability insurance, it opposes enactment of H.R. 3653 unless the bill is amended to:


— retain the current 20-years-from-date-of-occurrence statute of limitation; and

— lower the liability limit of $6.5 billion by about one-half.
If H.R. 3653 is not amended as described, the President's senior advisors would recommend disapproval.
