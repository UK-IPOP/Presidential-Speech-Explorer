I transmit herewith, for the consideration of Congress, a report by the Secretary of State resubmitting a claim of the owners of the British steamship 
 , amounting to $158.11, for demurrage to that vessel while undergoing repairs necessitated through a collision with the United States army transport 
 in New York Harbor on May 23, 1900.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
