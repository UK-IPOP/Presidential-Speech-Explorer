WELL, I congratulate you again. You are really making a contribution to the cause of democracy, because you not only educate yourselves but you educate some other people when you are doing this, and that is the most important thing in the world.
I hope that this function will be continued indefinitely. I think this is my 5th or 6th year congratulating the winners, and it always gives me a lot of pleasure, as I told them time and again.
And I think that with peace in the world, which we will eventually get, the greatest age in history is ahead of us. I would give anything in the world if I were 18 instead of 68, so that I could see it.
It is up to you now to make it work, and I am sure you will when the time comes.

Again, I congratulate you.
