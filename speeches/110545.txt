Mitt Romney today announced his Idaho County Chairs.
"I am pleased to announce the addition of these hard-working community leaders to my campaign in Idaho," said Mitt Romney. "My growing grassroots support is a sign that my message of cutting government spending and freeing the American entrepreneurial spirit is resonating with Idaho voters."
"I want to welcome these Idahoans to the ever growing Romney team," said U.S. Senator Jim Risch. "The work of our volunteer team will be critical to defeating President Obama, repealing Obamacare and getting spending under control in Washington. We still have much more work to do, but our team in Idaho is committed to working as hard as we can to spread Mitt Romney's conservative pro-growth message across Idaho and help him get elected in November."
