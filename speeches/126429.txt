The good news? The most recent poll shows John Kasich slightly ahead of Donald Trump in Ohio.
It's called "delegate math." Ohio and Florida are different from most other primaries in that they are "winner-take-all" states. 
 It also propels Kasich forward to states where he will perform well, enabling him to secure a surge of both delegates and momentum as we head to the convention.
