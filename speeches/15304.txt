Dear Mr. Feinsinger:
I have your letter of October 23 informing me of the action of the Wage Stabilization Board in making its recommendation for the final settlement of the labor dispute at the American Smelting and Refining Company at Garfield, Utah. You also state that the company and the union--The United Steelworkers of America (CIO)--have decided to accept and act upon this recommendation of the Board. This successfully disposes of the dispute and assures us the uninterrupted production needed to support our national defense program.
I am very pleased that the Board has been instrumental in settling this dispute, the first certified to it by me under the terms of Executive Order 10233. The Board has fully justified the expectation that it could be useful in the settlement of disputes affecting the defense program. Your Board has performed a real public service in assisting the parties to reach a peaceful settlement.
In times such as these, the parties to labor disputes owe it to the American people to make every effort to reach a settlement through collective bargaining and, that failing, to cooperate with their Government in maintaining or restoring production while their dispute is before the Board.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Mr. Nathan Feinsinger, Chairman, Wage Stabilization Board, Washington 25, D.C.]
