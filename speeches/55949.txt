The Administration fully supports immediate adoption of the amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 3575, as reported by the House Ways and Means Committee, so that checks can go promptly to those who need them. The bill represents a responsible bi-partisan compromise.

H.R. 3575 meets the requirements outlined by the President. It provides a temporary program for jobless workers. The benefits are paid for each year in accordance with the budget agreement. It, therefore, will not threaten economic recovery and its associated job creation by violating the discipline of the Budget Enforcement Act and increasing the federal deficit.
