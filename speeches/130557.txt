Our Nation's civil servants are making Government smarter, faster, and more responsive to the needs of the American people. They're partnering with leaders and advocates from State and local levels to help ensure the voices of the American people are heard. They're finding ways to process health benefits applications for disadvantaged tribal populations more efficiently and effectively, and making important strides in ending veterans' homelessness. They've worked to swiftly transport American aid workers with Ebola to the United States for life-saving treatment, and helped engineer a new spacecraft that could carry humans farther into space than we've ever seen before. They run airports and embassies, take care of troops and their families, defend the Nation's borders, make sure roads and railways are designed and built safely, and advance the frontiers of science and innovation.

America's Federal workforce relentlessly pursues the mission of bringing lasting change to the lives of ordinary people across America, often at great personal sacrifice and in the toughest of circumstances – including a politics that does not always fully recognize the value of their work.

Today, the President issued a

Through the 
, Federal employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau simplified the mortgage disclosures consumers receive when purchasing a home. The new forms replaced existing federal disclosures that often contained duplicative and sometimes confusing information. Millions of consumers are now receiving these forms when shopping for a mortgage and are receiving information to understand their options, choose the deal that's best for them, and avoid costly surprises at the closing table.

Ø 
Business and leisure travelers seeking to move more efficiently through airport security and customs can apply to participate in the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS)

A U.S. small manufacturer or service provider now can calculate tariffs applicable to their exports in 3 steps with the Free Trade Agreement Tariff Tool, access new export finance products with reduced application processing times, and use upgraded trade programs that have 
from 2010 to 2014.

Ø 
Individuals and families are better able to protect themselves from disasters and emergencies, thanks to 
 developed by Federal employees at FEMA. The app prepares individuals and families by providing access to safety tips, weather alerts, reminders of important actions to take to prepare before a disaster, and checklists of important supplies to have on hand. The app also provides lifesaving information when disaster strikes to assist survivors with maps of open shelters and recovery centers, and resources for additional assistance that might be needed.

America continues to be the world's most innovative country, with the greatest potential to develop the industries of the future and harness science and technology to help address important challenges. Federal employees are making important contributions to advance the frontiers of science and technology, including:

Ø 
 There has been 
, average tornado warning times across the country have improved threefold, and tornado warning accuracy has roughly doubled. For hurricanes, the National Weather Service is now using an upgraded Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting model that can now produce forecast guidance out to five days in advance for up to seven separate storms simultaneously. 

Ø 
Americans rely on advanced technologies like cellular telephones, GPS satellite receivers, and the electric power grid, which depend on the high accuracy of atomic clocks. The civilian time standard is about three times more accurate today than in 2008, thanks to the work of Federal employees at the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop the 
, which debuted in April 2014 and would neither gain nor lose one second in about 300 million years.

Ø 
 The aggressive pursuit of advances in Earth observations and long-term monitoring have led to a diverse array of space-based missions now providing new insights into Earth's interconnected natural systems through studies of Earth's atmospheric composition, carbon cycle, and climate. Federal employees worked to bring to fruition the launch of the Deep Space Climate Observatory in February 2015, which now resides one million miles away from Earth providing a unique, continuous view of our planet and serving as an early warning system for solar magnetic storms. In space science, in addition to the continued support of missions already underway—such as the Curiosity rover now exploring Mars, the 
 that took the most detailed photos of Pluto in history, and the 
 slated for launch in October 2018. Federal employees at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have also initiated work on the next generation of technologies to explore and understand the universe. The Wide-Field Infrared Space Telescope and the first mission to explore Jupiter's moon 
 are in early stages of development.

Ø 
 In October, 2014, Federal workers transitioned National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) operations to its Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) system, which helps forecasters manage the high volume of available weather data. The MRMS system generates products every two minutes, streamlining large amounts of data from multiple sources to provide more accurate and complete weather forecasts than traditional, single-radar systems. Using MRMS, NWS forecasters can pinpoint the location of severe thunderstorms, hail swaths, tornado tracks, and heavy rainfall. Because MRMS provides better depictions of high-impact weather events such as heavy rain, snow, hail, tornadoes, and other threats, forecasters can quickly diagnose severe weather and issue more accurate and earlier warnings.

Ø 
. Due to investments made by the National Weather Service in its network of radars, average tornado warning times across the country have nearly tripled, and tornado warning accuracy has roughly doubled. In 2015, residents of Rochelle, Illinois had 27 minutes of warning prior to an EF4 tornado compared to 25 years ago when the same community would have had 5 minutes – or no warning at all – to find shelter.



From Fresno, CA, to Detroit, MI, to Corbin, KY, Federal leaders are working hand-in-hand with local stakeholders to achieve meaningful progress in communities. Federal employees are coordinating behind the scenes, breaking down silos and building partnerships to meet communities' biggest priorities?—?from creating community-built greenhouses that boost innovative agriculture, to re-lighting city streets and bringing new businesses to formerly vacant downtowns.

 Like many American cities, Little Rock's Main Street experienced sharp economic decline over the last several decades. In 2010, Federal teams from the Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Transportation, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) came together and teamed up with Little Rock through the 
 and 
 Program to align transportation and affordable housing investments alongside environmental protection efforts. Federal, state and city leaders worked with Little Rock's residents and businesses to turn downtown Little Rock's vacant lots into pocket parks, line streets with mini gardens, and expand an existing trolley line. Federal employees from the National Endowment for the Arts helped the City continue making improvements to Main Street through the

With technical assistance from Federal employees and federal funding from across multiple agencies, a formerly vacant building on Main Street was renovated to create the Williamson Health and Wellness Center and provide health care services, nutrition education, and physical activity classes for residents who didn't otherwise have access. The Center established a downtown farmer's market and community gardens and a Health Innovation Hub to support new health and local food entrepreneurs. Now diabetic patients at the Center have access to health care, physical activity, and fresh food, and are seeing health improvements. New businesses are starting up in the downtown, bringing new energy and people to downtown. And Williamson is on a path to creating a healthy, vibrant future.
