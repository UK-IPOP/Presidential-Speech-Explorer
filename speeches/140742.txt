: "Microsoft's finding that it is Mr. Biden — not Mr. Trump — whom Chinese hackers are targeting also complicates a narrative pushed by the White House that China is interfering in the 2020 election to help the former vice president's campaign."

, 
: "Mr. Biden, according to analysts in China, could do more damage than Mr. Trump by pursuing a more coherent strategy to counter China's global agenda...'Biden would make the hard lines more effective and more efficient,' said Cheng Xiaohe, an associate professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. 'He might resort to more sophisticated and coordinated tactics against China.'"

, 
: "In China's hawkish quarters, in fact, there are some who believe that Mr. Trump's 'America First' presidency has, on the whole, benefited China by reducing American global leadership. A popular meme that has circulated for months mocks him as 'Build-the-Country Trump,' a pun on a revolutionary name that suggests Mr. Trump has done more to make China — and not the United States — great again." 
 
, 
: "Beijing worries that Mr. Biden's rhetoric is not just bluster, and that if elected, he would work more forcefully to penalize China on human rights issues than Mr. Trump, though his administration has recently imposed sanctions on a number of Chinese officials and companies. Mr. Biden has denounced China's repression of Muslim Uighurs as genocidal and vowed to meet with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader."

: "In Beijing, Mr. Trump is viewed in some ways as favorable because of his transactional approach, despite the sharp deterioration in relations since the coronavirus pandemic. The Communist Party has also benefited from images of chaos and division that have emerged from the United States under Mr. Trump. That has allowed the propaganda organs to highlight the strengths of China's authoritarian system in curbing the coronavirus outbreak. 'From the party's point of view, Trump is a rolling advertisement for how bad democracy could be,' said Kevin Rudd, the former prime minister of Australia, who maintains close ties to Chinese officials. Mr. Rudd said Chinese leaders see Mr. Trump as a 'genuinely negative force' when it comes to preserving American alliances in Asia and beyond." 
When the coronavirus was spreading like wildfire and other nations mobilized, Trump repeatedly cited Chinese government propaganda and praised Xi's containment efforts as successful to justify his own inaction -- despite numerous warnings from Joe Biden and Trump's own advisers.

Trump begged Xi to intervene in our elections to help him win a second term, and even publicly called on China to investigate Joe Biden for his own benefit.

Trump's trade war with China drove American manufacturing into a recession, then he struck a failed trade deal with China that the Chinese government is not even living up to.

And when it comes to his travel restrictions, Trump has repeatedly lied about their effectiveness and Vice President Biden's response to them. 
Xi is so easily able to manipulate Trump that Trump offered his explicit support for putting ethnic minorities in concentration camps.

This is precisely why China's officials are openly pulling for Trump to win re-election.

And it's no wonder that in poll after poll, American voters show that they trust Joe Biden significantly more than Donald Trump when it comes to handling China.
