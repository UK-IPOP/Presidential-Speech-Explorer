On October 9, 2004, the Afghan people will make history when they hold their nation's first direct presidential election. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for next spring.
"The Afghan people are showing extraordinary courage under difficult conditions... They've adopted a constitution that protects the rights of all, while honoring their nation's most cherished traditions. More than 10 million Afghan citizens -- over 4 million of them women -- are now registered to vote ... To any who still would question whether Muslim societies can be democratic societies, the Afghan people are giving their answer."
-- President Bush, September 21, 2004
*To ensure that no one votes more than once, each voter's right index finger will be stained with a long-lasting ink before the voter leaves the polling station. In addition, each voter's registration card number will be recorded and his or her card punched.
