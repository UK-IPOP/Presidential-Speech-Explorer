The President's economic plan is working, and we are making progress.

Today, we received news that our economy had zero percent inflation in July. Core inflation, excluding food and energy costs, went up 0.3% -- the lowest amount in several months. Real wages went up. Gas prices have declined $1 this summer â€“ one of the fastest declines in decades. This is providing families' breathing room.

And, the July jobs report showed that the unemployment rate matches the lowest it's been in more than 50 years: 3.5%. More people are working now than at any point in American history. During the President's administration, nearly 10 million jobs have been created - that's millions of families with the dignity and peace of mind that a paycheck provides.

There is more work to do, and Congress should send the Inflation Reduction Act to President Biden's desk as soon as possible, to lower health care, prescription drug, and energy costs.

 Holy cow: There was ZERO inflation last month. That's the headline number, which is well below expectations of +0.2%. Also a good core inflation reading: +0.3%, also below expectations of 0.5%. Finally some good news on the inflation front. We've likely seen the inflation peak.



 We knew headline inflation would slow in July because of falling gas prices. But "core" inflation (excluding food and energy) also cooled on a month-to-month basis: Prices up 0.3% in July, vs 0.7% in June. Year-over-year up 5.9%, same as a month earlier.



 Not to get lost in all the CPI chatter is this morning's real earnings report. Average earnings continued to increase last month, up a half-percent in July. 
 This is the first real earnings increase since Sep 2021!



: July was a huge inflation relief month for American consumers.



 A great CPI report. If you use the unrounded numbers the headline was actually -0.02%, deflation! Core was +0.3%, the lowest since September 2021. The more intertial parts of core, eg rent, slowed too. I only update a little based on 1 month but the update is a good one.



 Phew! July consumer price inflation was better than expected, easing in earnest due mostly to the decline in oil prices, and thus gas and diesel prices, from their record high 2 months ago. It won't be a straight line, but inflation appears set to steadily moderate from here.
