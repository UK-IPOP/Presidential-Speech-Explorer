My dear Mr. Teague:
I beg to acknowledge your letter of May 22nd on completion of your term with the Federal Farm Board. I greatly regret that your personal situation is such that you cannot continue on the Board for the present.
I wish to take this occasion to express my appreciation, and the appreciation which I know the whole agricultural industry holds, for the great service you have rendered and the devotion you have shown in the difficult times of the past two years.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. C. C. Teague, Federal Farm Board, Washington, D.C.]
