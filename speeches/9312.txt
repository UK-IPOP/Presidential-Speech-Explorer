MRS. HOOVER and I regret that we cannot be with you but are glad to have the opportunity of joining in your tribute to the genius of Thomas A. Edison on this anniversary. The debt which this country and indeed the whole world owes to Mr. Edison is everywhere recognized, but in this universal acclaim let us not forget the fine and admirable character, the lofty soul of the man to whom we owe so much. Here also is a source of pride to all Americans.
