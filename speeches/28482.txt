Mr. Chancellor:
We are honored to welcome you and the members of your party to this house and to this Nation's Capital on this magnificent spring day.
Just 17 years ago this week, when I was Vice President of the United States, I welcomed another Chancellor of your country to the United States, Chancellor Adenauer--he was of a different party. And now I welcome you today.
But while your parties were different, there are certain great principles that you both stand for, and that we stand for, that are bigger than party.
We have heard your national anthem just a few minutes ago. The title of that anthem has in it the words, "unity, justice, freedom," and those principles transcend party differences and national differences. They belong to men and women who love freedom all over the world.
Mr. Chancellor, you have been to our country many times, but most Americans welcome you and remember you, as I do, because you were the Mayor of Berlin-and we think of Berlin, that great and free city, as we welcome you today. And I hope that the talks that we have, and I am confident this will be the case, will contribute to the kind of freedom without which peace is meaningless and to that kind of peace which we need if we are to enjoy freedom.

We believe deeply in these values, and we are honored to receive you so that we can work together, your people and our people, toward achieving those great common goals.
