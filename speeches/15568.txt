 the strength of our Nation reflects the strength of the American home, which is based on the virtues fostered by the mothers of our country; and
, in recognition of the services rendered by American mothers, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 8, 1914 (38 Stat. 770), set aside the second Sunday in May as Mother's Day and lauded American mothers for their influence toward good government and their contributions to the moral and religious uplift of humanity:
 President of the United States of America, do hereby direct the appropriate officials of the Government to arrange for the display of the flag of the United States on all public buildings on Mother's Day, May 13, 1951, and I call upon the people to display the flag on that day at their homes or other suitable places as a public expression of honor for our mothers.
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 26th day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-fifth.

HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
DEAN ACHESON,
