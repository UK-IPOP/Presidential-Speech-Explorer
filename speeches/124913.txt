President Obama plans executive actions on gun control

He has waged war on the Constitution," Rubio told a packed crowd late Sunday in Raymond, N.H. "He is obsessed with gun control." Obama's moves were "meant to further erode the Second Amendment" and deny Americans the rights given by God, he argued. "I believe that every single American has a Constitution—and therefore God-given right—to defend themselves and their families," Rubio said. . . .

While criticizing Obama's moves, Rubio said they would be temporary. "Don't worry," Rubio said. "On my first day in office, behind that desk, don't worry, those orders are gone."
