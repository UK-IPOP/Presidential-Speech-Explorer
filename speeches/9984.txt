IN This anxious hour of a national emergency in our banking and economic life a heavy responsibility rests on our President to lead us out of our difficulties. He is ready to lead if we are ready to follow. He needs the united support of all our people in carrying out his plans.
Without regard to our political affiliations we Governors and representatives of Governors of States, met in conference in the City of Washington, March 6, 1933, hereby express our confidence and faith in our President and urge the Congress and all the people of our united country to cooperate with him in such action as he shall find necessary or desirable in restoring banking and economic stability.
