Requiring a face covering on public transportation and in transportation hubs has been a critical public health tool to prevent the spread of COVID-19, saving lives and allowing vulnerable Americans to safely travel to and from work; to go grocery shopping or visit the doctor; or to visit loved ones across the country.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently recommended that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) extend its current requirement for mask use on public transportation and transportation hubs for one month, through April 18th. During that month, CDC is working with other government agencies to help inform a revised policy framework for when, and under what circumstances, masks should be required in the public transportation corridor going forward. CDC has stated that this revised framework will be based on the COVID-19 community levels, risk of new variants, national data, and the latest science. CDC will communicate any updates publicly to the approach to mask requirements based on the results of this science-based process.
Public transportation and transportation hubs are places where people across communities congregate, often for extended periods and in close quarters. The determination of the timeline and circumstances under which masks should be required in these settings should be guided by science, not politics.
