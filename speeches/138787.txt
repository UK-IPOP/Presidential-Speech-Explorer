Happy Friday...
Pooler has her mask on, and has been tested...
Kellyanne Conway gaggled with reporters before pool call time. Below is a link to CSPAN video of gaggle where she suggested the president should resume daily coronavirus briefings with reporters.
So far, no public events on POTUS' schedule.
Forwarding from WH's Judd Deere >>
"Yesterday, President Donald J. Trump spoke with Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia to address growing security threats in the Indo-Pacific region. President Trump commended Prime Minister Morrison for increasing Australia's defense budget and thanked him for his leadership in calling for accountability and reform of the World Health Organization. President Trump also expressed his support for the people of Australia as they battle the coronavirus and face unfair retaliatory trade measures from China."
