Mr. President:
As we complete our talks, I wish to express my appreciation to you for your frankness and candor in discussing the problems that we mutually face in Vietnam, and I know that you share with me the sentiments that were expressed in our communiqué which has already been distributed to members of the press.
I believe that that communiqué indicates the progress that has been made and the progress we can expect in the future toward a resolution of this struggle which has torn apart the people of North Vietnam, which has cost your people so much in men, in lives, and has cost our people as well.
I would like to say, finally, this one personal word. You have a long journey. You will be back in Saigon tonight because of the time change. You will be speaking to the people of South Vietnam when you arrive.
Would you extend to the people of South Vietnam from the people of the United States our good wishes. We know how they have suffered. We share with them the tragedy of war. We want for them what we have for ourselves--the blessings of peace within our own country and within your own country.
We know--and I speak personally in this respect--that the people of your country are a peaceful people, a hardworking people; that if only you have the opportunity, Vietnam can be one of the most powerful, constructive forces for peace and progress and economic development in all of Southeast Asia and the Pacific.
This is what I feel from having been there many times before. This is what your people are fighting for. It is the goal which we all seek.
We wish you well, personally; more than that, the people of the United States wish your people well. We look forward to the day when they can live in peace together.
