Dear Senator Hartke:
I write to acknowledge your letter of January 27, in which a group of Senators join you. I am glad to have this expression of opinion.
I continue to be guided in these matters by the resolution of the Congress approved on August 10, 1964--Public Law 88-408-by a vote of 504 to 2. My views of the present situation remain as stated in my recent reply to a group of Members of the House, of which I enclose a copy.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Honorable Vance Hartke, United States Senate]
