Dear Mr. Prime Minister:
It was kind of you to write about my forthcoming visit to Turkey.
I am happy to have this opportunity to pay my respects to the people and Government of Turkey.
I look forward to meeting you again and having another talk as we did on the occasion of your recent visit to the United States.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
