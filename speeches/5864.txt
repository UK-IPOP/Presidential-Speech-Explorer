I submit herewith copy of a letter from the Secretary of the Treasury inclosing a memorandum and letter from the Director of the Mint relative to a modification of the deviations now allowed by law from the standard weight of the silver coins of the United States.
The Secretary of the Treasury approves of the suggestion of the Director of the Mint, and it is recommended by both that section 3536 of the Revised Statutes be amended by striking out the following words:
And in weighing a large number of pieces together, when delivered by the coiner to the superintendent, and by the superintendent to the depositor, the deviations from the standard weight shall not exceed two-hundredths of an ounce in one thousand dollars, half-dollars, or quarter-dollars, and one-hundredth of an ounce in one thousand dimes.
From the memorandum prepared by the Director of the Mint it is apparent that a saving in the manufacture of subsidiary silver coin would be effected by amending section 3536 of the Revised Statutes as proposed, and I recommend that favorable action be taken by the Congress.
