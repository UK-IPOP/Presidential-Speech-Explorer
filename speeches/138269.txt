Good afternoon from Morristown Municipal Airport, where we're awaiting POTUS and FLOTUS to head back to Washington at 4:25 pm today.

We're due to arrive at JBA at 5:15 pm.

Pool had their temperature checked and were asked if they experienced any symptoms over the last 48 hours before leaving the hotel.

Please let know if you have any questions. 


Marine One landed at 4:58 pm.

POTUS, FLOTUS and their son Barron stepped out on to the tarmac and POTUS waved to the press before boarding AF1. The president did not take questions.

As noted on Friday, we're taking the smaller plane so your pooler will not have cell service. We're boarding for DC at 5:03 pm. 


We were wheels down at 5:54 pm.

Co-pooler Sebastian Smith spotted an object that appeared to be a drone beneath AF1 as we landed.

POTUS, FLOTUS and Barron deplaned and did not talk to press before walking over to Marine One. POTUS briefly paused and waved to the press before joint his family again. FLOTUS' parents were spotted boarding Marine One as well.

Marine One lifted at 6:14 pm.

Handing off to in-town pool. Have a good night!
