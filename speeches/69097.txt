The Administration applauds the House for its efforts to produce a bipartisan FDA reform bill, and appreciates the responsiveness to concerns that have been raised. Because of the importance of obtaining a five-year extension of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), the Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 1411 at this time.
This legislation represents a significant step toward accomplishing the mutual goal of assuring the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) optimum performance while protecting the health of the American public. The Administration, however, 
 with the bill and will work to ensure that these concerns are addressed. For example:
In order to be able to support a final bill, the Administration will continue to work in conference to resolve these and other issues, including (1) the lack of user fees for food contact substances, (2) the effective restriction on public comment on regulations issued under the Nutrition Labeling and Education Reform Act, and (3) the imbalance between the regulatory and resource requirements in H.R. 1411 and in S. 830, the Senate companion bill.
According to CBO estimates, H.R. 1411 would be subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 because the bill's provision extending market exclusivity for certain drugs would increase direct spending. CBO estimates that H.R. 1411 would increase direct spending by $65 million during FYs 1999-2002. OMB's preliminary scoring of H.R. 1411 is under development.
