The Administration supports S. 184.



S. 184 would reduce receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. The bill does not contain provisions to offset the reduction in receipts. Therefore, if the bill were enacted, its deficit effects could contribute to a sequester of mandatory programs.

The preliminary OMB scoring estimates of this bill are presented in the table below. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from these estimates. If S. 184 were enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published within 5 days of enactment, as required by OBRA. The cumulative effects of all enacted legislation on direct spending and receipts will be reported to Congress at the end of the congressional session, as required by OBRA.
