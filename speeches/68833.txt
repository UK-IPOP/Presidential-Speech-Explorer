In order to advance the efforts of the President's Community Empowerment Board (CEB) and to facilitate interagency coordination and cooperation, I hereby order the following:


The Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Administration, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality will become members of the CEB. 
With these additional members, I am confident that we will be able to better provide distressed communities with a single Federal forum dedicated to helping them address their economic and community needs.

WILLIAM J. CLINTON
