Awaiting the President. 2 min warning at 12:02pm
From the press office:
Jen Klein, Co-Chair & Executive Director of the White House Gender Policy Council, will join Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre at the press briefing today.
The briefing will commence shortly after the conclusion of the President's remarks.
President Biden entered the Roosevelt Room at 12:04pm.
His remarks are streaming live.
President Biden denounced the Dobbs ruling and sought to rebut the conservative majority's reasoning and rationales for overturning Roe v. Wade.
The Supreme Court in Dobbs made a "terrible, extreme and I think totally wrong-headed decision to overturn Rov v. Wade... This was not a decision driven by the Constitution [...or] by history."
He criticized the majority for reading the Constitution as frozen in the mindset of the 1800s, when women didn't even have the right to vote.
He predicted record turnout by women voters to reclaim rights taken from them by the Supreme Court.
The fastest way to restore reproductive rights is for Congress to codify those rights, he said.
Cites rape of a 10 year old girl who had to go to another state "already traumatized" to obtain an abortion. "Ten years old!...A 10 year old girl should be forced to give birth to a rapist's child?" What could be more extreme, he said.
He warned that extremist Republicans even want to impose a national ban on abortion. As long as he's president such a bill would be vetoed, he said.
Biden's prepared remarks still underway at 12:17p. He is now describing his executive order.
President Biden's prepared remarks in the Roosevelt Room lasted from 12:04pm to 12:21pm.
He warned that the Dobbs decision threatens all sorts of privacy rights beyond reproductive rights.
He insisted the right of privacy is "yes, yes, embedded in our Constitution."
He then sat at the small desk beside the lectern and signed the order with one pen that he handed to Vice President Harris.
Q&A begins with question on assassination of Japan's forme prime minister Abe.
He said he will stop at the Japanese embassy en route CIA this afternoon to offer condolences.
Called the current Japanese PM "a very solid guy" and doesn't expect any destabilizing effect.
Asked second question as he departed at 12:24 he said on China tariffs: "I haven't made that decision."

The president arrived at the Japanese ambassador's residence (not the embassy) at 2:02p after an uneventful motorcade along upper Embassy Row, past the Naval Observatory and National Cathedral and farther along Massachusetts Ave to Western, passing American University.
Pool is in a hallway next to a koi pond with a view through two sets of windows to the desk set up with a condolence book. Two vases of flowers. The flag of Japan to the right of the chair.
At 2:06 the president placed a small bouquet on the desk and sat down. The Japanese ambassador stood over his right shoulder as he wrote a condolence message after the assassination if Abe.
The president remained seated at the desk at the Japanese ambassador's residence from 2:06p to 2:10. He seemed to concentrating and writing the entire time. When he rose, he turned to the Japanese ambassador. They shook hands. POTUS put his left arm on the ambassador's right elbow.
Everyone was indoors. Overlooking outdoor koi pond.

Passing on from the press office, attributable to a White House official:

The U.S. government will continue to be in regular contact with Paul's family, and with the families of other Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad, to provide support and assistance and keep them updated on efforts to secure the release of their loved ones.

Marine 1 looped in from the setting sun, turned south to fly over the beach and set down on an empty parking lot at the Gordon's Pond area of Cape Henlopen State Park at 2010.
President Biden stepped off the helicopter at 2013 and walked to the waiting SUV.
At 2015 his motorcade is underway.
The pool van was not in the presidential motorcade, but the White House press office informed pool at 2028 that the president arrived at the Bidens' beach home following the brief drive.
That is all for today.
