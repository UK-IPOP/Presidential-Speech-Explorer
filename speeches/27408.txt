IN THE brief span of less than ten years, the United States Space Program has advanced from small and hesitant beginnings into a large and vital national effort. Today, its achievements provide daily testimony of our country's leadership in space capabilities, in their applications to peaceful practical purposes, and to the advancement of scientific understanding of the world in which we live.
But space is a hostile medium both for man and his instruments and therefore long periods of study, planning and hard work are required before major space undertakings can be successfully executed and their benefits fully harvested. For this reason, my Science Advisory Committee during the last year has been examining the many faceted problem of what the United States might do in space in the early years following our Apollo Program. They have examined the potentialities and the value of new space programs and recommended a course for the future.
We will give careful consideration to these recommendations. Because the opportunities in space are great but the costs are high, our space planning deserves the thoughtful consideration of all Americans. I am therefore releasing this report for publication so that the excellent work of this Committee will be available to all as we chart a course into the future.
