Senator ,Anderson, Mr. Vice President, Congressman Morris, Joe Montoya, your Governor-elect:
I want to express a very warm welcome on behalf of all of us to all of you. We've come down to Santa Fe and then go to Los Alamos to see some of the things which the people of this State, the scientists, the engineers, and the workers, are making to keep this country strong here in this country and in outer space. And I'm particularly glad to come down as the guest of your distinguished Senator, Senator Anderson, who speaks for this State and also speaks for our country.
Most of all, I am delighted to come back to Santa Fe and New Mexico and to tell you how much we have appreciated your friendship in the past and how pleased we are to be here again.

Thank you.
