 Nonfarm payroll employment decreased by 84,000 jobs in August, and the unemployment rate rose to 6.1 percent. While these numbers are disappointing, what is most important is the overall direction the economy is headed. Last week, the economy posted a strong gain of 3.3 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter, led by growth in consumer spending, exports, and a well-timed and appropriately sized stimulus package. This level of growth demonstrates the resilience of the economy in the face of high energy prices, a weak housing market, and difficulties in the financial markets. Orders for durable goods have been rising in recent months. In addition, productivity growth over the past four quarters has been strong at 3.4 percent â€“ above the averages for each of the past three decades over the course of the Administration.
 If Democratic leaders in Congress are not willing to take comprehensive action, President Bush has called on them to act at least on three common-sense energy proposals.
 Opening markets is extremely important during this time of economic uncertainty. Exports account for a greater share of America's gross domestic product than at any time in our history. These trade agreements will create more opportunities for American manufacturing interests, farmers, ranchers, and entrepreneurs.
 At a time of economic challenge, the last thing American families need is a massive tax increase. The President's 2001 and 2003 tax relief fueled economic growth and reduced the burden on everyone who pays income taxes. Without President Bush's tax relief, Americans would have paid an additional $1.3 trillion in taxes by the end of 2007. If the President's tax relief is allowed to expire at the end of 2010, Americans will pay about $280 billion more in taxes each year.
