 – On Tuesday, July 24th, 2007, Senator John Edwards will visit Atlanta to hold a "Small Change for Big Change" grassroots fundraiser. Edwards' visit comes as he continues to gain strength in the state. Today, more than 20 prominent Georgia Democrats endorsed Edwards as the strongest candidate to put a Democrat back in the White House and the candidate with the boldest ideas to change our country and build One America.
The Edwards campaign has been built on reaching out to all Americans – not just those who can give the maximum donation to the campaign, so it has organized grassroots fundraisers around the country for supporters who share Edwards' commitment to building One America. The details of the event are:
