The Administration supports House passage of HR 1305. However, the Administration will urge the Senate to defer consideration of section 201, which re-authorizes two National Park Service advisory commissions. Under Executive Order 12838, a detailed review of the justification of all advisory commissions is underway. As a general policy, new statutory commissions should not be created pending completion of the review.



H.R. 1305 would affect direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990. The preliminary OMB PAYGO estimate is zero.
