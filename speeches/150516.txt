 How are you feeling, Mr. President?
How are you feeling, sir?
How are you feeling?
 Feeling great. Tested negative again today. Been testing every day. All good. All is good.
To what extent do you expect the inflation bill to help Democrats during the midterms once it passes, Mr. President?
 Will I expect it to help? Yes, I do. It's going to immediately help. For example, no senior will have any—on Medicare—will have bills of more than $2,000 for drugs, no matter what the costs are. That's a big deal. It changes people's lives. There's a whole range of things that are really game-changing for ordinary folks.
Now, some of it is not going to kick in for a little bit, but it's all good. It's really going to lower the daily—when you sit down at that kitchen table at the end of the month, you're going to be able to pay a whole hell of a lot more bills because you're paying less in medical bills.
Mr. President, how worried are you about the situation in Taiwan? Because China is—they're kind of keeping a bit of a grip around the whole island now.

 That was her decision.
Thank you.
