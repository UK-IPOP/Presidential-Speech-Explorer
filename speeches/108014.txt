Romney for President today announced the first wave of Reaganites for Romney, a group of officials and leaders who served in the Reagan Administration and in various political roles during the Reagan Administration. Ambassador Jerry Carmen will serve as Chairman of Reaganites for Romney.
"These individuals were part of a movement that changed America and the rest of the world," said Mitt Romney. "The smaller government policies of the Reagan era helped turn around a struggling economy and create millions of jobs. And the strong defense of freedom around the world led to the crumbling of empires and dictatorships. I am proud to announce this group of conservative leaders — with their help we can recreate the robust job creation of the Reagan years."
Announcing Reaganites for Romney, Ambassador Jerry Carmen said, "Supporters of Ronald Reagan are supporting Mitt Romney because he is the best chance conservatives have to return to the prosperous Reagan years. His economic plan will unleash job-creation in the private sector, his trade policies will open markets around the world, and he will stand up to countries that have pledged to destroy our allies. Mitt Romney will restore faith in our country in much the same way Ronald Reagan did thirty years ago."
