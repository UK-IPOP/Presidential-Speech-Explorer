In advance of the midterms, I am proud to announce two historic promotions to our senior team. Stuart Delery and Julie Rodriguez are dedicated public servants that bring diverse perspectives and a shared commitment to tackling the critical issues our Nation faces today. I am immensely grateful for the service of Dana Remus, who has been an invaluable member of my senior staff for the past 3 years and helped reinstate a culture of adherence to the rule of law. I wish her the best as she moves forward.
