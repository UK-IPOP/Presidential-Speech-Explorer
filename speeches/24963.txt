HERBERT CLARK HOOVER was not only a dedicated President, but he was a truly great humanitarian. He placed service to his country, and to the cause of humanity throughout the world, above all else. His outstanding contributions to the operations of our Government and the wise and generous counsel he gave to leaders of both national parties who followed him in office exemplify the highest traditions of public service. They make his birthplace a deeply significant part of our Nation's history, a part that will now be preserved and made accessible to all Americans.
