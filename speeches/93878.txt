 The Action Plan contains 14 broad recommendations and 50 action steps that provide a road map for better protecting American consumers and enhancing the safety of the increasing volume of imports entering the United States. The Action Plan is the product of extensive coordination among Federal agencies, months of hands-on information-gathering, and feedback and suggestions from the private sector.
 One of these steps was a directive to Federal agencies to accelerate their participation in an automated "single window" system for reporting imports electronically. This will enable better coordination and efficiency to permit information exchange among government agencies and between the government and the importing community in real time.
 This plan uses science and a risk-based approach of prevention, intervention, and response to ensure the safety of domestic, as well as imported, foods consumed by Americans. It will support the FDA's ongoing collaboration with other Federal agencies that have a role in the safety of our Nation's food supply, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service.
 The Working Group is chaired by HHS Secretary Mike Leavitt and is comprised of 12 Federal departments and agencies.Working Group members visited more than two dozen cities across the country, covering ports, railroads, airports, freight hubs, border crossings, wholesalers, retailers, fruit stands, and meat and seafood processing facilities. The Group presented its initial findings to the President on September 10, 2007.
