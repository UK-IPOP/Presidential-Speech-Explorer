I WILL BE obliged if you will express my cordial greetings to the Grand Street Boys' Post Number ten twenty-five of the American Legion and to their guests the Disabled Veterans of the World War of the metropolitan area of New York at the dinner this evening. The disabled veterans by their service to our country have earned its undying gratitude and I gladly share in the honors you are paying them.
