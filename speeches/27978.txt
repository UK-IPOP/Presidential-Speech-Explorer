Dear Dr. Mayer:
It was particularly thoughtful of you to write to me about the Williamsburg meeting. It should be an extremely useful review of the work accomplished over the past year since the original White House Conference. I understand that you have already done a great deal to develop plans for this follow-up conference, and I want you to know how much I appreciate not only your encouraging comments but also your readiness to continue helping us out.

With best wishes,

Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
