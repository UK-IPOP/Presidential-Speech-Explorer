Good Monday morning from Wilmington, Del., where the pool is awaiting President Biden's departure under partly cloudy skies and temperatures of 70 degrees F. The pool received Covid-19 tests earlier this morning ahead of the president's return to Washington.
Here's a rundown of Monday's schedule, via the White House:
President Biden's motorcade departed his Wilmington residence at 9:06 a.m. ET. The pool's bus has joined the motorcade and we are now rolling.
We will be flying back to JBA on Air Force One. The president traveled to Wilmington Saturday aboard Marine One; the press pool arrived unilaterally in Delaware Saturday aboard an Osprey.
More TK.
President Biden's motorcade arrived at the Delaware Air National Guard Base at 9:15 a.m. after an uneventful ride from his home.
The president, joined by first lady Jill Biden, exited the Beast and did not stop to speak to media under the wing.
The Bidens walked up the stairs to Air Force One, the president waved and then entered the aircraft.
At 9:18 a.m., we are wheels up shortly for the roughly 35-minute flight to Joint Base Andrews.
Traveling with the President and the First Lady to the White House:
Daleep Singh, Deputy Assistant to the President & Deputy National Security Advisor and Deputy Director of the National Economic Council
Ashley Williams, Special Assistant to the President & Deputy Director of Oval Office Operations
Jordan Montoya, Director of Advance and Trip Director for the First Lady
Air Force One landed at Joint Base Andrews at 9:51 a.m. The pool did not have any visitors during the short 30-minute flight from Delaware.
President Biden and first lady Jill Biden held hands as they walked down the staircase from Air Force One at 9:58 a.m.
The president, dressed in a dark suit, blue dress shirt and red tie, was carrying an iPhone in his right hand. He did not stop to speak to reporters. Dr. Biden was wearing a blue jacket and a light blue print dress. Both were wearing black face masks.
The Bidens paused briefly to speak with Col. William "Chris" McDonald, Vice Commander, 89th Airlift Wing and his wife, Diana. The four walked together and then the Bidens boarded Marine One.
Marine One lifted off at 10:05 a.m. en route to the White House.
Now handing over to the In-town pool. Thanks all.
