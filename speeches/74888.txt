 Hi, Helen [Helen Thomas, United Press International].
 Do you have the votes?
 We don't know yet.
 How are the votes going?
 We don't know yet. That's why we're here today. We're working it.
 You don't know?
 If we can get the right bill before them, we have the votes. I don't know if we've got the votes to get the right bill before them, you know, to get through all the thicket of rulemaking. But we're working it.
