â€” delete title IV because it would provide an unjustified exemption to four water irrigation districts by voiding a requirement in current law under which user charges are imposed on non-Federal powerplants for the use of Federal dams and facilities related to hydropower production. Such exemptions are unfair and out of step with the general trend to compensate the Government when its property is used for private purposes.
