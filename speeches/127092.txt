This is a country of underdogs. But we will win. And when we do, we will do what needs to be done. And our children will be the freest and most prosperous Americans that have ever lived. And the American Dream will change more lives than ever before. And we are going to leave for our children what Americans always leave their children: the single greatest nation in the history of all mankind.
