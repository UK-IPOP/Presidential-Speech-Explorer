Dear Charlie:
Two years ago when you agreed to return to public life as this nation's Permanent Representative to the United Nations I felt that your appointment was among the best that I was making in forming my Administration. Your performance during these 2 years has more than confirmed that judgment.
Your performance at the United Nations has been a source of great strength to the foreign policy of the United States and has been characterized by the highest degree of professionalism. You have understood, and have brought others to understand, the full dimensions of the contribution which the United Nations can make and must make to a world of peace and justice. Your entire career has exemplified the best American traditions of public service. At the United Nations you have been the embodiment of the oldest American tradition, that of a decent respect for the opinions of mankind.
I count upon being able to benefit in the future as I have in the past from the wisdom and prudence which you have so unselfishly contributed to the counsels of your nation for forty years.
I am grateful to you, and accept your resignation with regret and with the warmest personal best wishes.

Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
[Honorable Charles Yost, United States Representative to the United Nations, New York, New York]
