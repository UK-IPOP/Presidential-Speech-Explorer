THE PRESIDENT said:
"The critical situation facing all countries in their international relations, the manifold economic and other problems demanding wise solution in our national interests call for experience and judgment of the highest order. The importance to our country of the sound determination of these worldwide difficulties needs no emphasis.
"I have decided, therefore, to call upon one of our wisest and most experienced public servants to accept a position which will enable him after many years of distinguished public service at home to render equal service to his country in the foreign field.
"I have asked Mr. Mellon to undertake the Ambassadorship to Great Britain. I am happy to say he has now expressed his willingness to serve."
