 Mr. President, are you encouraged by developments in the Gulf?
 Well, I'm hopeful. It's a little early yet to reach a final conclusion. We're watching it very closely.

 Mr. President, why do you meet with the auto industry as often as you do?
 Why do I?
 Yes.
 Because it's an important part of our economy, an important part of our strategy for economic revival, and because we've had a good partnership in working on a lot of issues.
I'm very encouraged and Americans should be, not just the people of Michigan but the people of the United States, that the auto industry is back, clearly, leading the world now in sales of cars at the cutting edge and rebuilding our manufacturing base here at home. That's a big part of the objective of my administration. So I'm encouraged by it. I want to keep working with them.
 How did you feel about your reception?
 It was great.
