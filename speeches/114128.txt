"Ohio's middle-class families can't afford four more years like the last four years in the Obama economy. As a result of President Obama's failed economic policies, jobs are down, poverty is up, and household incomes are at their lowest level in decades. Ohioans deserve better. Mitt Romney will deliver a real recovery for middle-class Americans by helping create 12 million new jobs, more take-home pay, and a trade policy that finally works for hard-working Americans." — Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson

 "China's undervalued renminbi is a long-standing, bipartisan concern, and it is not a phony one: In pursuit of growth led by exports, China has held the renminbi down in relation to the dollar, rendering its goods artificially cheap in the U.S. market. The renminbi would gain about 20 percent against the dollar if it were allowed to float freely like other currencies, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics. China's policy has probably cost Americans hundreds of thousands of jobs and contributed to China's destabilizing pile of trillions of dollars in reserves." (Editorial, "Breaking China?,"
