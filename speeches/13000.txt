 we who are determined to seek and to find highways to a new world of peace and cooperation may take inspiration from the faith and courage of Christopher Columbus, who sailed across an uncharted sea and found a western continent and a new world; and
 at this time, when the Italian people are striving to win back for themselves an honorable place in the family of nations, it is especially fitting that we honor the vision and achievement of a great Italian; and
 Public Resolution 21, Seventy-third Congress, approved April 30, 1934, provides:
"That the President of the United States is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation designating October 12 of each year as Columbus Day and calling upon officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on said date and inviting the people of the United States to observe the day in schools and churches, or other suitable places, with appropriate ceremonies expressive of the public sentiment befitting the anniversary of the discovery of America";
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Tuesday, October 12, 1943, as Columbus Day; I direct that on that day the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings; and I invite the people of the United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies in schools and churches, or other suitable places.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 5th day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-eighth.
