 Hillary and I want to wish all of you a very Merry Christmas. Tonight we gather with family and friends to reflect on our good fortune, rejoice in memories of the last year, and look forward with hope to the year ahead.
 So from our family to yours, Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, and God bless you all.
