MR. LONGWORTH served his fellow countrymen in State and Nation for over 33 years--nearly the whole of his adult life. In his service he contributed greatly to the welfare of the American people. His happy character, his sterling honesty, his courage in public questions, endeared him and held the respect not alone of his myriad of friends but of the country at large. His passing is a loss to the Nation.
