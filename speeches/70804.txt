 What a wonderful poster!
[

 Isn't that great? Maybe I ought to read that to people.
 And they want you to come visit their class. [

 This is your grandson's class?
 That's my grandson's class. That's right.
 We went to the classroom.
 We had a great day down there.
 We did, indeed.
 And I have to follow that? [
] I didn't bring a book.
 This is beautiful, too. Nice.

 There's one thing Angela didn't do; she didn't tell you that she's going to write a book saying, "How Being a Member of the Advisory Board Changed My Life." [
]
 It's here on the tape, the first chapter. [

 We had a long discussion about where that came from. [
] I thought I never heard it before you said it, but I like it. I'm going to use it shamelessly. [
]
[
]
 I accept that. That's great.
 And so we're praying for you, and we thank you so much for flying on Air Force One and eating ribs with you. Thank you. [

 You need to tell me how you want me to sign that, and I've got a special pen, and we'll sign it, and I'll bring it over there.
[
]
 That's a real advance. [

 You know, let me just say— I'll be very brief, because I know we're supposed to go over to this other deal, and I think Linda's got to go. But I just want to thank you for doing this and for being brave enough to do it.
I knew when we started that all of us would be subject to some criticism because, number one, we couldn't solve every problem in America overnight related to race; number two, you could almost relate every problem in America to race; and number three, in a cynical and weary world, it's easy to devalue the importance of people going in good faith to raise the consciousness and quicken the conscience and kind of lift the spirits of other people and encourage them to do the right thing, and then to figure out—it is a complex thing, figuring out how much of this is policy, how much of this is dialog, how much of this is community, how much of this is almost spiritual.
I think you have really made a heroic effort to come to grips with all of these elements and to make this a very important milestone on America's journey here, and I hope you'll always be proud of it. I really think—you know, it was a big risk. I knew a lot of people would say, well, we didn't do this; we didn't do that; we didn't do the other thing; or we said this, and it was wrong. And probably some of that criticism is valid. But when you take it all and shake it up, I think there is no question that what we did at this moment, in the absence of a searing crisis, facing a future of incredible kaleidoscopic diversity, was a very good thing for our country. And I do think that we have to keep it going, and I will take all these recommendations seriously.
I hope you all meant what you said today. I hope it was a great gift for you, because for your country it was a great gift.
 We are deeply grateful to you, Mr. President.
 Thank you. Well, I'll see you over there—except Linda, who has an excused absence.
