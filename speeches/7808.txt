My dear Mr. Robb:
I hope most cordially that the annual conventions of the Associated Press and the American Newspaper Publishers Association will be sources of deep satisfaction to those who attend them. The splendid cooperation of the press in the measures taken to stabilize the economic situation of the country has been of the highest value, and they can most usefully forward this work by continuing to express the justified optimism of American business, industry and agriculture over the outlook for steadily increasing employment and prosperity.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Arthur R. Robb, Managing Editor, Editor and Publisher, 1473 Broadway, New York City]
