 ROMNEY: "It's absolutely critical that we don't have that massive tax hike and instead we make the Bush tax cuts permanent." (Gov. Mitt Romney, Remarks At The Detroit Economic Club, Detroit, MI, 2/7/07)
 ROMNEY: "We should strive to keep marginal tax rates on America's families and businesses no higher than those imposed by our major global competitors. We should end tax penalties against saving and investment, and promote fairness and simplicity by ending special interest loopholes and lowering tax rates for all Americans." (Romney For President, "Governor Romney's Remarks At The Club For Growth," Press Release, 3/29/07)
 ROMNEY: "This is fundamentally a plan, which is based on individuals being helped to get their own private health insurance policy." (Fox News' "Journal Editorial Report," 6/3/06)

 CLINTON: "As I travel around America, I hear from so many people who feel like they're just invisible to their government...

 SEN. HILLARY CLINTON: "It's time for a new beginning, for an end to government of the few, by the few and for the few, time to reject the idea of an 'on your own' society and to replace it with shared responsibility for shared prosperity. I prefer a 'we're all in it together' society." (Sen. Hillary Clinton, Remarks At Manchester School Of Technology, Manchester, NH, 5/29/07)
 CLINTON: "You know, if you're a family that is struggling, and you don't have health care, well you are invisible to this President. ... but they're not invisible to me and they won't be invisible to the next President of the United States..."

 "Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Rodham Clinton vowed Monday to create a universal health care system if elected, saying she 'learned a lot' during the failed health care effort of her husband's presidency. 'We're going to have universal health care when I'm president - there's no doubt about that. We're going to get it done,' the New York senator and front-runner for the 2008 nomination said." (Mike Glover, "Clinton Touts Universal Health Care Plan," 
, 3/26/07)
 "But in the longer term, it's a just one more step on the road to 'HillaryCare' - the program of government-run, universal health-care that Americans rejected so decisively in the early Clinton years. The problem, as the Clinton plan foretold, is that eventually bureaucrats will decide which medical procedures are covered and which aren't, with patients forced to see a government-approved doctor instead of choosing their own, and health-care services rationed (again, by bureaucrats) to hold down costs." (The Heritage Foundation Website, 
, Accessed 8/14/07)
 CLINTON: "And I never thought I would see that our soldiers who serve in Iraq and Afghanistan would be treated as though they were invisible as well." (Clinton For President, Television Ad, "Invisible," 8/15/07)
