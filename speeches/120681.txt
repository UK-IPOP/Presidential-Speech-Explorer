 also found that Sen. Paul is the Republican candidate most likely to beat Hillary Clinton in 2016 general election. This polling suggests that Sen. Rand Paul is the only Republican candidate capable of making the party bigger, better, and bolder.
"Poll after poll shows that I am the strongest candidate, and I believe it is because I am unwilling to dilute my constitutional conservative message. We must be boldly for conservative principles like a 'Fair and Flat tax' plan, protecting the entire Bill of Rights, and balancing the budget. The Democrats have no qualms stampeding all over our civil liberties, but it is clear that the 'Live Free or Die' has had enough. As President, I will restore civil liberties and unleash the American Dream ,"
