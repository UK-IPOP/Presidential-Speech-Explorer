Dear Mr. Chairman:
I have reviewed with interest your report on the status of the employee-management cooperation program in the federal service.
Cooperation between federal managers and employee organizations is a source of strength in the civil service. We must rely upon the creative energies of employees to help insure that personnel practices and working conditions in Government are the best that can be devised.
I believe the progress made thus far in setting up an orderly system of relationships is most encouraging. It is understandable that there will be difficult questions to be worked out and I am confident all concerned will seek fair and reasonable solution of these problems within the basic framework of Executive Order 10988.
This program is a great step forward. It is important that it continue to be put into effect in accordance with its intended purposes. We must all work together to achieve the full potential it affords for improvements in the public service. Please continue to keep me advised.
Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Honorable John W. Macy, Jr., Chairman, United States Civil Service Commission, Washington, D.C.]
