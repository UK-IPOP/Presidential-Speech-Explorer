Today, the White House released a report, 
 detailing the President's all-of-the-above energy strategy and the profound transformation in the domestic energy sector since the President took office. Thanks to this dramatic transformation and the President's bold, aggressive plan, the United States has seen significant economic and national security benefits, and we are tackling the challenges posed by climate change.
The President has set out an aggressive All-of-the-Above energy strategy recognizing that no single energy source alone can accomplish all that is required to face our challenges and meet our goals. Instead, the President continues to push on multiple fronts to strike the right balance of energy sources that will power our economy forward. The President's plan is three-pronged: to support economic growth and job creation, to enhance energy security, and to lay the foundation for—and take critical steps towards—a low-carbon energy future.
