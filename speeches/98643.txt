ARLINGTON, VA -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign today released its latest web video entitled "Barack Obama Forgot Latin America." The web video points out what was missing from Barack Obama's speech in Berlin as a citizen of the world any mention of a city or country in Latin America. As a citizen of the world, Barack Obama failed to mention a major part of the world.
