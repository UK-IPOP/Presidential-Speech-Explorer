On Wednesday, over a dozen amicus curiae briefs were filed in support of the Biden Administration's case before the Supreme Court for one-time debt relief. The briefs come from a broad coalition of legal scholars, public officials, economists, and advocacy organizations, underscoring why the Administration's debt relief plan is legal, and why challengers to the program lack standing to even bring their cases to the Court.

States that filed an amicus brief in favor of the student loan forgiveness program include California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Washington, and others.

"Student debt cancellation will strengthen state and local economies and promote household financial stability and public health, reducing reliance on state safety nets," the governments write.
