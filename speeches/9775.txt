AT THE MEETING of the Cabinet this morning, the budget situation was reviewed and the reductions in appropriations for the fiscal year beginning July 1 next were settled at about $700 million. This will, however, be offset by certain increases in uncontrollable items such as interest and amortization on the public debt and tax refunds to the extent of about $150 million.
The increase in fixed charges is partly due to the Government investments in the Reconstruction Corporation, the land banks, and elsewhere, of over $1 billion which will ultimately return to the Treasury. The administration is determined to present a balanced budget.
The detailed figures of the budget are never given out until the President's budget message is communicated to the Congress.
