 section 318 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (46 Stat. 696; U.S.C. title 19, sec. 1318) provides:
Whenever the President shall by proclamation declare an emergency to exist by reason of a state of war, or otherwise, he may authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to extend during the continuance of such emergency the time herein prescribed for the performance of any act * * *;
 section 557 of the said act (46 Stat. 744; U.S.C. title 19, sec. 1557) provides:
Any merchandise subject to duty, with the exception of perishable articles and explosive substances other than firecrackers, may be entered for warehousing and be deposited in a bonded warehouse at the expense and risk of the owner, importer, or consignee. Such merchandise may be withdrawn, at any time within three years (or ten months in the case of grain) from the date of importation, for consumption upon payment of the duties and charges accruing thereon at the rate of duty imposed by law upon such merchandise at the date of withdrawal * * * 
, That the total period of time for which such merchandise may remain in bonded warehouse shall not exceed three years (or ten months in the case of grain) from the date of importation * * *;
, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the foregoing provision of section 318 of the Tariff Act of 1930, do by this proclamation declare an emergency to exist.
And I do hereby authorize the Secretary of the Treasury, until further notice:
(1) in the case of merchandise (except grain) imported during the calendar year 1934 and entered for warehousing under section 557 of the Tariff Act of 1930, to extend the warehousing period for not more than one year from and after the expiration of the three-year period prescribed in sections 557 and 559 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as extended for one year under the authority of Proclamation No. 2214, dated December 29, 1936.
(2) in the case of merchandise (except grain) imported during the calendar year 1935 and entered for warehousing under section 557 of the Tariff Act of 1930, to extend the warehousing period for not more than one year from and after the expiration of the three-year period prescribed in sections 557 and 559 of the Tariff Act of 1930.
, That in each and every case the Secretary of the Treasury shall require that the principal on the warehouse-entry bond, in order to obtain the benefits under the extension granted, shall either furnish to the collector of customs for the district in which the merchandise is warehoused the agreement of the sureties on such bond to remain bound under the terms and provisions of the bond to the same extent as if no extension were granted, or furnish an additional bond with acceptable sureties to cover the period of extension: 
, That the extensions of one year herein authorized shall not apply to any merchandise imported during the year 1934 as to which the period of extension authorized by Proclamation No. 2214, dated December 29, 1936, has expired, or to any merchandise imported during the calendar year 1935 as to which the three-year period prescribed in sections 557 and 559 of the Tariff Act of 1930 has expired.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 29th day of December in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-second.
