IN SIGNING this measure which affects our servicemen who are prisoners of war in Southeast Asia, I wish to reemphasize the determination of this Government to do all in its power to secure their earliest possible release from captivity.
For the families of these men, no other effort on our part can or should be an acceptable substitute for this goal. Recognizing this fact, there is, of course, no monetary payment that I, as President, or this Government might authorize which would compensate adequately for the sufferings and hardships endured by these men and their families. It can only be my fervent hope that the payments provided in this act will in a small way serve as a symbolic gesture on the part of the U.S. Government, expressing its recognition and appreciation for the sacrifices that these men have made and continue to make in the service of their country.
