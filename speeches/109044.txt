Today, we need an even stronger response.
Below are 10 new reasons from supporters who've financially invested in our campaign.  If you find a reason you agree with, we urge you to 
 with that person in the amount you can afford.
Whether it's your first donation or your third to our campaign, we need all hands on deck again to help fund our upcoming efforts in November.  Every dollar you invest is incredibly appreciated by Governor Huntsman and our team.
We are reaching a crucial stage and we must have the funding in place to contact new voters on the ground here in New Hampshire and in key states across the country.  So please make an immediate donation in the amount you can afford.
Jon Huntsman is the principled, thoughtful leader we need to turn our country around.
I'm proud to stand with Jon Huntsman.  If you are, I urge you to join me and the 10 supporters listed below by 
 to Governor Huntsman's campaign for President.
