Last night, Marco Rubio was in Salt Lake City, Utah where over 400 people came out to hear him speak about his vision for a New American Century.

Support continues to grow for Marco in the western states. This trip followed a recent campaign stop in Nevada, where 1,200 people came out to his town hall in 
, a happy hour in 
 and a rally in 
 Marco also chatted in-depth about what it was like to spend part of his 
 in Las Vegas.

Below are some highlights from Utah.


 "This election is not a choice between Republicans and Democrats alone," he said. "This election is a generational choice, and here's the choice: What kind of country are we going to be in the new century? We'll either be the first Americans who leave our children worse than ourselves, or our children will be the freest and most prosperous Americans ever."

 Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio pitched himself as a fresh face in his party's crowded primary contest during a Monday night campaign stop in Utah. The 44-year-old Rubio spoke about outdated government policies that haven't kept up with disruptive technologies like ride-hailing company Uber.

 He offered a long list of proposals for improving the economy, including allowing high school students to learn a trade so they can be prepared to work upon graduation, promising to be the "vocational education president." Rubio drew applause and cheers for a number of stands he took, including for repealing President Barack Obama's signature health care law and replacing it with a plan that allows people to purchase their choice of plan with a refundable tax credit.



 The Florida senator then hit on a laundry list of topics — from energy policy to national security to vocational training and economic policy — during his 40-minute stump speech, drawing a handful of ovations and chants of "Rubio! Rubio!"
