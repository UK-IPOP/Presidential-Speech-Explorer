THE DEATH of Ralph Harmon Booth, U.S. Minister to Denmark, which occurred today, deprives the public service of an able and devoted man. Appointed to the post in January 1930, after a distinguished career in American journalism, he had already rendered valuable diplomatic service. His death is a loss to the country.
