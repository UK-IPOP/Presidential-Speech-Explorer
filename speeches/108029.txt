Mitt Romney today announced the support of New Jersey leaders, including 14 of the 16 Republican members of the State Senate, and 28 of the 33 Republican members of the New Jersey State Assembly, 37 of 42 members of the New Jersey Republican State Committee, and all 21 Republican county chairs.
"I am so proud to have the support of so many conservative New Jersey leaders," said Mitt Romney. "This wide range of support shows that my message of reining in government spending, lowering taxes, and creating jobs is resonating with voters in the Garden State. I look forward to working with these distinguished men and women to get our country back on track."
Announcing the additional New Jersey endorsements, Governor Chris Christie said, "I firmly believe that Mitt Romney is the only candidate in either party who can restore our nation's fiscal health and get Americans back to work. Our country needs a president who knows that lasting prosperity will not come unless we pay down our debt and create jobs for the middle class. Mitt Romney has spent his life in the real economy and this valuable experience is what we need in our next president."
