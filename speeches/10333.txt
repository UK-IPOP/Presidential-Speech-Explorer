THE PRESIDENT said:
"I feel deeply the loss of James Francis Burke. He was an ardent supporter and a high official of the Republican Party. In addition he was identified with a multitude of public movements not only in his own city but over the country. For many years he gave his time and service to matters of public interest in every direction in the public good. An indefatigable worker, he labored for the country he loved up to the hour of his death."
