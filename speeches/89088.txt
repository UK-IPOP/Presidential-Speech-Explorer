The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2956. Success in Iraq is critical to our national security and to victory in the War on Terror. H.R. 2956 would infringe upon the constitutional authority of the President as Commander in Chief by imposing an artificial timeline to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq, regardless of the recommendations of our commanders in combat. Decisions about military strategy, including appropriate troop levels, must be based on the recommendations of our commanders in combat. This legislation would substitute the judgments of politicians for the considered judgment of our military commanders.
