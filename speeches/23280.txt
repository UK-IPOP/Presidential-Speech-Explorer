Dear Arthur:
The regret with which I accept your resignation from the Cabinet is matched only by the depth of pride and pleasure which accompany my opportunity to name you to the Supreme Court.
You have been a wise and invaluable member of the innermost councils of this Administration; and your voice, counsel and tireless efforts will be sorely missed. But you shall bring distinction to our highest Court for many years after this Administration has gone; and I did not feel that I could deny our country and Constitution those benefits of your talented service.
As Secretary of Labor, you have brought to that Department a stature and significance which have never been surpassed. Your ceaseless and judicious laboring on behalf of industrial peace and economic stability have earned you the high respect of both management and union representatives. Your effectiveness in championing the rights of working men and women and their families is demonstrated by the enactment in this Congress of new legislation increasing minimum wages, supplementing unemployment compensation, tightening the safeguards on welfare and pension funds, providing for the retraining and placement of our unemployed manpower, aiding areas of chronic distress, improving the lot of migrant workers and modernizing our eight-hour laws. You have, in addition, played a major role in the passage of the Trade Expansion Act, new programs for juvenile delinquents and unemployed youth and executive efforts to improve the employment opportunities of minority groups.
You go now to a post of grave responsibility; and I have the utmost confidence in your ability to fulfill the obligations of that post with honor and brilliance. While the Constitutional separation of powers now rightly alters our relationship, you will always remain in the esteem and affection of us all.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
[Honorable Arthur I. Goldberg, The Secretary of Labor, Washington, D.C.]
