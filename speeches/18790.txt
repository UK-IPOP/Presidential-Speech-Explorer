Mr. President:
I am most grateful for this medal. I have only one regret, that the message that I delivered to your Congress was not so eloquent as I could have wished in expressing the true affection that the United States has for Uruguay, and the feeling of brotherly comradeship with them that we always cherish.
Could I have put those thoughts in the proper words, they would have been more valuable. But I do thank you very much.
