"President Obama's failure to lead has brought us to an unthinkable, fourth straight trillion-dollar deficit. Under the President's reckless spending policies, we've seen the financial burden on future generations grow, while the White House has ducked hard decisions on reining in our mounting debt and deficits. As president, Mitt Romney will take immediate action to cut spending and stop passing our bills on to the next generation." – Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman

 "The latest posting by the Treasury Department shows the national debt has now increased $4 trillion on President Obama's watch. The debt was $10.626 trillion on the day Mr. Obama took office. The latest calculation from Treasury shows the debt has now hit $14.639 trillion. It's the most rapid increase in the debt under any U.S. president."

 OBAMA: "[T]oday I'm pledging to cut the deficit we inherited in half by the end of my first term in office. This will not be easy. It will require us to make difficult decisions and face challenges we've long neglected. But I refuse to leave our children with a debt that they cannot repay – and that means taking responsibility right now, in this administration, for getting our spending under control." (President Barack Obama, 
, Washington, D.C., 2/23/09)
 OBAMA: "The problem is, is that the way Bush has done it over the last eight years is to take out a credit card from the Bank of China in the name of our children, driving up our national debt from $5 trillion for the first 42 presidents - #43 added $4 trillion by his lonesome, so that we now have over $9 trillion of debt that we are going to have to pay back -- $30,000 for every man, woman and child. That's irresponsible. It's unpatriotic." (Sen. Barack Obama,

 "'Gaps' in President Obama's leadership contributed to the collapse of a 'grand bargain' on spending and debt last year, with the president failing to cultivate congressional relationships that may have helped him break through Republican opposition, author Bob Woodward told ABC News' Diane Sawyer." (Rick Klein, "Bob Woodward: 'Gaps' In President Obama's Leadership Contributed To Debt Deal Collapse," 
, 9/10/12)
 "Woodward's reporting in his new book, 'The Price of Politics,' reveals a president whom he said lacked the 'stamina' in turning personal relationships with congressional leaders into action the way some of his predecessors have done." (Rick Klein, "Bob Woodward: 'Gaps' In President Obama's Leadership Contributed To Debt Deal Collapse," 
, 9/10/12)
 "Asked if Obama simply wasn't ready for the job of being president, Woodward responded: 'I am not ducking this. I am weighing evidence, and there's evidence that he got on top of a lot of things, he did a lot of things. And there's evidence that there are gaps,' he said. 'He did not fix this.'"
