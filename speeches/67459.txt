Today, Bob Dole released the following statement from Washington, D.C:
"Today we pause to honor those men and women who through their service to our great nation were captured and held as prisoners of war or are still missing in action. I believe these Americans fulfilled the highest call to duty. We believe further improvement of relations with those countries who still withhold information on our POW/MIA's should be contingent upon their cooperation in achieving a full and complete accounting. America has one last obligation to them and their families; to discover the fate of every last POW and MIA."
--Bob Dole
