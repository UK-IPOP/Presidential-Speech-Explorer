"You've got to push back against that impulse to just spend more money. … And the way you do that is by imposing across the board budget cuts, I did them anywhere from 5%, I think maybe the highest I did was 15, might have been 20 the first year that I was in office and had to close that $2.3 billion gap. … But what it did mean was we held down spending growth, sometimes we actually reduced spending for the first time just about in the history of the city, and what we did do, we reduced city government spending consistently over eight years as a percentage of GDP, and New York's economy grew twice as fast as the city budget and that hadn't happened … for a very, very long time."


 "Of all the problems Giuliani will face, none will loom larger – or sooner – than the question of what to do about the city's finances." (Karen Rothmyer, "Giuliani Seen As Good For Business," Newsday, 11/4/93)

 "Facing a deficit projected to grow to $2.3 billion because of spending increases built in to the city's budget, Giuliani balanced the books by slashing discretionary spending, by relentlessly pushing for productivity gains from city workers, and by selling city assets. … By the time Giuliani had finished, he'd cut enough city fat not only to offset the billions in automatic spending increases but even to reduce total city spending by $680 million – the first time in nearly a half century that the city's budget shrank from one year to the next."
