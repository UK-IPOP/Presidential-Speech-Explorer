Pool Reports by 
, 
Good morning from Wilmington. Sharing this statement from Press Secretary Jen Psaki:
"The President has been briefed overnight about the horrific shootings in Atlanta. White House officials have been in touch with the Mayor's office and will remain in touch with the FBI."
Happy St. Patrick's Day!
The pool joined President Biden's motorcade in Wilmington at 7:52 AM. The first item on his schedule today is mass in honor of St. Patrick's Day.
President Biden's motorcade arrived at 8 AM at St. Patrick Roman Catholic Church in Wilmington. Pool did not see him enter the church.
From the White House: Livestream links for the mass:
They are also planning on posting it to their Twitter: @stpatscentrwilm
President Biden's motorcade left the church at 9:06 AM. It is grey and overcast here.
He is scheduled to depart Wilmington for Washington DC shortly.
President Biden's motorcade arrived at Delaware Air National Guard Base at 9:18 AM. He is returning to Washington on Air Force One.
He boarded at 9:21 am. He said Happy St. Patrick's Day before he climbed the steps and waved at the pool.
We are boarding. Note that this is the small plane which will limit cell service. We will be wheels up shortly.
Air Force One landed at 9:59 AM after a brief flight. President Biden exited at 10:10 AM.
He boarded Marine One immediately without stopping to speak to pool and was wheels up at 10:16 AM.
Handing over to the in-town pool. Thanks again to co-pooler Emily Goodin.
