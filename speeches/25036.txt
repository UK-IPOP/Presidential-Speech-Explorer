THIS ACTION taken jointly by five governments constitutes a most welcome and significant contribution toward the solution of one of the world's oldest and most serious health problems. I am especially pleased that we are doing this during International Cooperation Year. The battle against cancer was one of my foremost thoughts when I proclaimed 1965 International Cooperation Year in the United States last fall. I said then that I hoped my cancer committee could come up with some good results. This is a valuable step in the right direction.
