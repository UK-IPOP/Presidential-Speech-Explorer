The Administration strongly opposes enactment of H.R. 2418 unless it is amended to:


â€” reduce the excessive authorization levels for fiscal years 1986-88 that are $200 million above the comparable levels in the President's Budget and the Concurrent Budget Resolution.
Similar provisions to those contained in this bill were part of an omnibus health services bill which was vetoed by the President last year.
