Mr. President, Senora Lopez Mateos, ladies and gentlemen:
It is indeed a great honor for me to be able to respond this evening to the gracious words and greetings of the President of Mexico.
While we stand here, may I ask all of you to turn to look at this wall, to see a picture from one of the most distinguished artists that is being placed in one of our art galleries. If you need any other evidence than a mere sight, to know that it is a work of art, I must tell you that the artist is a true one, because he is 84 years old, has one leg, and likes to go to night clubs.
I assure you, sir, that the American people will appreciate your very great kindness in making this work of art from this extraordinary individual-whose name, by the way, is Atl, which means "water"--in making it available to them in this way.
In the last few days, the friendship of the President and me has ripened. I am quite sure it is going to be, possibly, even a little bit closer, after tomorrow. He is experiencing one of the incidents of public life in Washington that I go through regularly--he is going to meet the press. I am quite sure that there will be even a warmer feeling of sympathy between us.
In any event, I join in his Toast to friendship--to friendship that makes both countries stronger, better, and happier, and will do that through the years.
So, will you please join now in a Toast to the President of Mexico.
