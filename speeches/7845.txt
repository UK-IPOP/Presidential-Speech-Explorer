[Released April 2, 1929. Dated April 1, 1929]
I HAVE received Your Excellency's thoughtful message and I ask you to convey to the French people this Nation's heartfelt thanks for their deep sympathy. Mr. Herrick had endeared himself to his fellow countrymen, not only as a statesman but as a truly noble character. I shall [p.53] always remember him as a loyal and constant friend. His influence toward peace and justice won the love of the French people and will be an inspiration and example to our two countries.
HERBERT HOOVER
[His Excellency Gaston Doumergue, The President of the French Republic, Paris]
