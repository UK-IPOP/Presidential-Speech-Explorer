"Girls can do anything."
In the entire history of the United States, only 44 women have held the title of U.S. senator.
Ten current members of the Senate girls' club came together to talk about why they're supporting one of their own.
"I want people to remember that Hillary was a U.S. senator from New York when they were hit hard by those planes crashing into the World Trade Center. And I still get chills thinking about Hillary. She went and stood on the rubble after 9/11 with a mask on. And she knew at that moment what the first responders were facing, health-wise. And she fought and fought to make sure we never forgot about those first responders. And I'll never forget that."
"Hillary was incisive and determined. Compassionate. Qualified."
"It's like what she said in Beijing. Women's rights are human rights. And so it's not like women are in some little silo. We are part of the human family. And the progress of any part is progress for the whole."
"June Cleaver? Would people get that?"
"My home state is at the forefront of medical research and innovation. I know Hillary will fight hard for the critical investments our nation needs to find the treatments and cures that will help people stay healthy and ultimately, save lives."
"I have seen Hillary fight from the first time I met her when we were on a panel together in Detroit. She was there talking about children and child abuse on behalf of the Children's Defense Fund. I was in awe. I said, ?Who is this woman?' Because she was so passionate and so articulate.
"I saw that same fight again when we came into the Senate together after the 2000 election. Whether it was equal pay, whether it was fighting to close loopholes to bring jobs home, whether it was lowering the cost of college, mental health, Hillary is someone you can count on to be there for you."
"They see the world differently."
"Speaks for itself. Show that to everyone!"
