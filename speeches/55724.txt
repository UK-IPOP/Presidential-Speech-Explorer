The Administration supports the capital provisions (Title II and certain sections of Title 1) of H.R. 2900. These provisions put in place for the first time a comprehensive approach to help ensure the financial safety and soundness of the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC). H.R. 2900 would implement major principles proposed in the Administration's legislation earlier this year by establishing: (1) a separate, arms-length Office of Secondary Market Examination and Oversight within the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD); (2) a three-part capital standard (including risk-based); and (3) authority for the Director of the new Office to take enforcement actions when capital is at unacceptable levels.

H.R. 2900 is not consistent with a major principle proposed by the Administration: that the HUD Secretary's current general regulatory authority must not be eroded. Because of the serious consequences of potential insolvency of the government sponsored enterprises (GSEs), the Administration, through HUD, must retain programmatic authority over the GSEs. Accordingly, the Administration will support enactment of H.R. 2900 only if it is ultimately amended to address the following concerns by:







OMB'S preliminary scoring estimates of this bill are presented below. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from these estimates. If H.R. 2900 were enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published within five days of enactment, as required by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA). The cumulative effect of all enacted legislation on direct spending and receipts will be issued in monthly reports transmitted to the Congress.
