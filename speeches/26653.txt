Dear Mr. President:
I was deeply distressed to learn of the tragic loss of life caused by the earthquakes in Sicily. All Americans join me in offering our heartfelt sympathy to you and the people of Sicily. I am asking Ambassador Reinhardt to keep in close touch with the Italian authorities to determine in what way we can be of assistance in this sad moment.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[President Giuseppe Saragat]
