Florence, South Carolina – Senator John Edwards visits South Carolina today to discuss his plan to revitalize rural South Carolina communities through his Rural Recovery Plan. Edwards will speak at the Florence County Democratic Party's "First Monday Breakfast Club" Lunch, and then take a walking tour of Bishopville—a rural South Carolina community—with State Representatives Leon Howard and Grady Brown and actor Danny Glover. Edwards will meet with South Carolinians to discuss the challenges facing rural communities and to discuss his plan to restore economic fairness and create new jobs and businesses in rural areas across America, help struggling counties and towns and protect the rural way of life.
"Growing up in mill towns, I didn't have much, but through hard work and with the support of my family and community, I was able to go to college and get ahead," said Edwards. "Today, too many Americans are separated from the same opportunities I had. Across America and here in South Carolina, many rural communities are struggling. We need to help small towns and rural communities create and keep new businesses and good jobs, and we need a president who will make sure all our communities have good schools, good health care and the support systems they need."
Born in Seneca, Edwards knows the struggles of rural South Carolina families. He believes that America cannot turn its back on rural communities that are the keepers of American values like family, work, community, and freedom. Today, many rural areas are struggling: rural families in South Carolina earn 13 percent less than other families and the ten poorest counties in the state are rural. Rural manufacturing has been hit particularly hard by international trade, outsourcing, and automation. Edwards has laid out a Rural Recovery Plan to lift up rural communities.
