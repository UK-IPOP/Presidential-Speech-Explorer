Re: Fred Thompson Campaign Apologies
In light of Mike Huckabee's heartfelt apology to Mitt Romney for making reference to Romney's religion in the New York Times Magazine, we at the Thompson Campaign would like to offer Huckabee our own heartfelt apologies for some references we've made about his record as Governor of Arkansas.
A recent Washington Post-ABC News Iowa poll of Iowans likely to vote in the Republican caucus stated illegal immigration as their top issue of concern, tied with the war in Iraq.( 
 
In 2002, Governor Huckabee strongly advocated lifting the embargo against Cuba saying it "harm[s] our own agricultural and business interests," "has not helped the people of Cuba" and has "provided Castro with a convenient excuse for his own failed system of government." (
)
Average Arkansan's tax burden increased by over 47% between 1997 and 2005 (or $933 per person). (
)
In an interview with CBNNews in November, Huckabee said "...I truly understand the nature of the war that we are in with Islamo fascism. These are people that want to kill us. ... And I don't know if anybody fully understands that. I'm the only guy on that stage with a theology degree." (
