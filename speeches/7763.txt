THE PRESIDENT said:
"There is no truth in the statement that Mr. Hilles has been displaced in New York appointment matters. Some discussion has taken place on better coordination of the differing departmental practices in relation to Congressional and organization recommendations from New York, but no conclusions were arrived at and Mr. Maier was requested to consult various interests as to development of methods."
