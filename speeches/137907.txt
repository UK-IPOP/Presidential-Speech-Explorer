. Mr. President, have you thought of a name for the horse yet?

I did. "Victory."

Victory.

 "Victory." Thank you very much for the horse. Did you see a picture of the horse?

Not yet.

 Beautiful.

 Will it come here to the White House?



 Mongolia—they're great fighters. You know, they're great fighters, great wrestlers, great champions. Right? And we have the grand champion of sumo wrestling with us, from a couple of years ago. And he's here from Mongolia. I was told that in Japan, actually, that they've had four grand champions from Mongolia. So they're great, great fighters. Your people are great fighters.

Thank you very—we need great fighters too.



Do you have any intelligence that Bin Laden's son has been killed?

 I don't want to comment on it. I don't want to comment on that.

Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.



Can we see you in 8 minutes for the Fed rate cut?

 Yes, we'll have a comment on it. I'll gladly have a comment on that.
