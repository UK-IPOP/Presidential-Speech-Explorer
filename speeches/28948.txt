Ladies and gentlemen:
Ambassador Lodge, Ambassador Walsh, and Mr. Habib were here for the meeting of the Cabinet and the Security Council, and helped to brief the Council on the situation in Vietnam and in Paris.
They are the senior members of our negotiating team in Paris, and immediately after this meeting will be flying to Paris for the plenary session of the Paris meeting, which will take place tomorrow.
Ambassador Lodge does have time to answer a few questions before he leaves, and I will present him to you now.
Mr. Ambassador.
[At this point Ambassador Lodge answered questions from reporters.]
