My dear Dr. Kirchwey:
I will be obliged if you will express my cordial greetings to the Eighteenth Annual Conference of the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, and my deep sense of their useful service in striving to maintain motion pictures upon a high plane adapted to the social needs of the community.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
