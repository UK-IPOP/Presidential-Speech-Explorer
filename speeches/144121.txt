AF2 landed in Singapore on Sunday at 10:48 amlocal time after a roughly 25-hour journey.

Harris, wearing a navy suit, deplaned at 11:02 am. She chatted with her greeters for a few minutes and instead of shaking hands, they put one hand to their chest. They were all wearing masks.

Per VP's office, she was greeted by:


Motorcade now en route at 11:07 am for RON, where we will be tested and quarantining for a few hours.

Before our Singapore arrival, AF2 landed in Tokyo for another refueling stop at 3:23 amlocal time. We took off for the final leg of the flight at 5:06 am.

And in case you missed the in-town pool report from earlier today, VP joined POTUS for the security briefing earlier today from the plane.

There will be another background briefing for pool during our quarantine time. Will send info from it shortly after. 


Motorcade made it to the hotel at 11:40 am. We immediately had to get in line for covid testing and are now quarantining for up to 6 hours.

We are told we won't be seeing the VP again today.

Only thing on our schedule is the background briefing. Will follow up with any information from that, based on embargo.
