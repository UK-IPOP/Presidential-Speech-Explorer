So his people were active -- let's put it that way." SINGER: "Okay. And just to confirm, you said it, but this is something they approached you rather than..." KERRY: "Absolutely correct. John Weaver of his shop approached..." (My DD Website,

 ABC's CHARLES GIBSON: "But, let me, let me, let me imagine it. If he asked you, if he came across the aisle and asked you, would you even entertain the idea? Or will you rule it out for good and all and ever right now?" SEN. JOHN MCCAIN: "John Kerry is a very close friend of mine. We've been friends for years. Obviously, I would entertain it."
