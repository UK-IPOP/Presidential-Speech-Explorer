 â€“ Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced that 27 men and women will serve as California Finance Co-Chairs. These Co-Chairs will help Governor Romney build the organization and raise the resources needed to campaign in California and across the nation.
"I am honored to have the support of this distinguished group of leaders who together represent the tremendous dynamism and innovation of the Golden State," said Governor Romney. "Californians know a leader when they see one and they showed great wisdom in sending Ronald Reagan to Sacramento and on to the White House. Just as President Reagan guided us through perilous times, I believe that conservative principles are again what we need to meet a new generation of challenges."
