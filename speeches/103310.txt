 Today, President Obama signed an Executive Order that makes significant improvements to federally funded partnerships between the government and faith-based and neighborhood organizations. These changes were recommended by a taskforce of the President's Advisory Council on Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships, a group of church-state experts from across the ideological spectrum and unanimously approved by the full Advisory Council. These leaders identified specific ways the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnership should strengthen the constitutional and legal footing of social service partnerships involving religious and neighborhood organizations and provide greater support and clarity to these important organizations.

"These are important, substantive changes that are directly responsive to the recommendations of church-state experts across the ideological spectrum," said Joshua DuBois, Executive Director of the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships. "With this Executive Order, we are strengthening and clarifying the legal footing of the government's relationship with faith-based organizations and underscoring the important role of these organizations in serving individuals, families and communities in need."
 Specifically, the Executive Order:
The Executive Order creates an interagency working group of federal agencies, co-chaired by the Office of Management and Budget and the White House Office of Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships, to submit to the President a report containing recommendations necessary to ensure that agency regulations and guidance documents are consistent with the fundamental principles of the Order. This is the first time this kind of interagency working group has been established. It will bring about greater uniformity in the rules that will aid in the effort to ensure fidelity to constitutional principles and greater clarity for the nation's hardworking nonprofits as they serve people in need in line with relevant guidelines.
