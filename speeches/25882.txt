I AM deeply gratified that after a long 11 months of totally unjustified detention by the North Koreans, the crew of the U.S.S. Pueblo have been freed. They should be reunited with their families in time for Christmas and I am happy for them that their time of ordeal ends on a note of joy.
I want to pay tribute also to the patience and courage of these relatives while their husbands, fathers, and sons were held by the North Koreans.
The negotiations at Panmunjom were cruelly drawn out and I am grateful for the understanding which the Pueblo families showed through the long and painful period during which their Government has sought to free the crew.
I must express my deep sorrow over the death of one crew member, Seaman Duane D. Hodges, who was killed while endeavoring to carry out his duties during the seizure of the ship.
I also want to thank our negotiator at Panmunjom, Maj. Gen. Gilbert H. Woodward. He carried out his difficult and successful assignment with distinction and has preserved the integrity of the United States while obtaining the release of the men of the Pueblo.
