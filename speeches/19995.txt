Dear Dr. Lleras:
I am pleased that Vice President Nixon is having the opportunity to visit Colombia and to discuss with you and other Colombian leaders matters of mutual interest to our countries. Undoubtedly such exchanges of views will serve to strengthen further the long and dose ties of friendship and cooperation that have linked the United States and Colombia.
The recent expression of popular will in Colombia is gratifying to the world as indicative of the return of Colombia to constitutional processes of government, and your election as President of Colombia is heartening to all of us who cherish democratic political institutions.
I am happy to take advantage of Vice President Nixon's presence in Bogota to extend through him my warm greetings to you and my best wishes for the success of your administration.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
