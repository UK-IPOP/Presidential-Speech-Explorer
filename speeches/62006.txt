The Administration supports the objective of administering the black lung benefits program more equitably and efficiently and applauds the provisions of H.R. 2108 that would carry out that objective. The Administration, however, is very concerned about the enormous debt in the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund and the additional debt that would result from certain provisions of H.R. 2108. Accordingly, the Administration recommends that H.R. 2108 be amended to (1) include only changes that would improve the equity and efficiency of the program, and (2) fully offset any costs generated by these changes.

The Administration urges that H.R. 2108 be amended to limit changes to the Black Lung Benefits Act of 1969 to the following features:



H.R. 2108 would increase direct spending; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA).

OMB's preliminary PAYGO scoring estimates of this bill are presented in the table below. Final scoring of this legislation may deviate from these estimates. If H.R. 2108 were enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published within 5 days of enactment, as required by OBRA. The cumulative effects of all enacted legislation on direct spending and receipts will be reported to Congress at the end of the congressional session, as required by OBRA.
