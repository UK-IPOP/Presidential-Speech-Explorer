THE DEATH of Vladimir Komarov is a tragedy in which all nations share. Like three American astronauts who lost their lives recently, this distinguished space pioneer died in the cause of science and in the eternal spirit of human adventure.
I extend the sympathy of the American people to his family and to the people of the Soviet Union.
