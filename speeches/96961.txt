Today, Hillary Clinton called on the Administration to move beyond the principles and long-term recommendations in its blueprint for financial market regulation and to focus on proactive, pragmatic actions that it could take with Congress to shore up our housing and credit markets, restore confidence, and keep millions of families in their homes.
While Senator Clinton appreciates and agrees with some of the recommendations in the Administration's plan, she believes it is too short on action. Ensuring effective functioning of our financial markets is not solely an issue of how we rearrange the chairs that regulators sit in; or who the regulators report to. It's also about what the regulators are mandated to do, and whether they act. It's about leadership to both establish a 21st century regulatory framework and appoint regulators who are committed to enforce new and existing rules that help maintain stability and avert crises.
To help move the debate beyond words, working groups and white papers, Senator Clinton called for six immediate steps to strengthen regulation of our financial markets and address our immediate housing and credit crises.
