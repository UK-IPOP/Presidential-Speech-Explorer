"The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)...is the primary way Congress meets its most important constitutional obligation to 'provide for the common defense.' It advances the vital funding and authorities that America's military requires. In an era of unprecedented threats, uncertainty, and technological change, the legislation ensures America's Armed Forces are agile, efficient, ready, and lethal." (NDAA For FY2016 Conference Report, 
)
"Mr. Cruz regaled the crowd about how he had opposed a proposal to intervene in Syria and how he doesn't support 'nation building.' To this he could add a few others: He has consistently voted against defense reauthorization bills that enable troop funding." (Kim Strassel,

"And since entering the Senate in 2013, Cruz has voted against the annual National Defense Authorization Act, a broad, comprehensive defense budget authority bill that helps fund missile-defense programs in Israel like Iron Dome." (

"But of the many programs funded by the NDAA support missile defense in Israel. Included in the FY2015 NDAA passed last year, for example, were $622 million for cooperative programs with Israel, including $351 million earmarked for Iron Dome. The next year's NDAA, passed earlier in 2015, added an additional $320 million to the president's request for Iron Dome and other cooperative programs with Israel. His reasons may have been unrelated to these programs, but Cruz voted against the comprehensive bills that funding." (
