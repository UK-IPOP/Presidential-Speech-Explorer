THE FIVE stockpile bills I signed today once again mark the achievement that comes from unity of purpose.
American industry, the Congress, and the executive branch have joined together in a creative partnership to make this legislation a reality.
Approximately $500 million worth of metals and materials--from aluminum to sisal--no longer required in our stockpiles will be freed to meet the urgent needs of mills, factories, and laboratories across the Nation.
As a result, the taxpayer, the economy, and our defense effort will benefit.
I particularly want to call attention to the action of the aluminum industry. Through its cooperation with the Government a long-range disposal program has been worked out to the mutual advantage of all concerned.
Congress has already passed 18 stockpile bills at this session. Under the able leadership of Senators Russell and Symington and Congressmen Rivers and Philbin I believe that prompt action can be taken on the remaining 7 bills before the session ends.
