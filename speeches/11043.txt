My dear Mr. Pope:
I cordially congratulate you and your coworkers upon the fiftieth anniversary of Il Progresso Italo-Americano. The Americans of Italian origin have brought many contributions to the industries and arts of this country, and these are deeply appreciated. Your labors to make easier the transition to the new ideals and loyalties of America are worthy of much praise.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Generoso Pope, President, Il Progresso Italo-Americano, 42 Elm Street, New York City]
