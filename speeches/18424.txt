Dear Mr. DiSalle:
I appreciate greatly your willingness to sacrifice your time and personal interest to undertake for the remaining days of my administration the position of Administrator of the Economic Stabilization Agency.
We both feel strongly that the stabilization program is a vital part of our defense mobilization and our national security under the present economic conditions in which that program must operate. Your service in this field, in which you have both outstanding experience and a record of high accomplishment, will greatly assist in the maintenance of a strong stabilization program which can be turned over to the new administration as a functioning and effective operation.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Honorable Michael V. DiSalle, Washington, D.C.]
