My dear_____________:
On January 17, 1947, I informed you that representatives of my office and of the armed services were engaged in drafting a bill to be submitted to the Congress for its consideration concerning a plan of unification. This draft, entitled "National Security Act of 1947", has now been completed and I am enclosing herewith a copy of it.
This proposed bill has the approval of the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
It is my belief that this suggested legislation accomplishes the desired unification of the services and I heartily recommend its enactment by the Congress.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
