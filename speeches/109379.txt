"Four years ago at the Democratic National Convention, then-candidate Barack Obama said that Democrats measure progress by whether people can find a job and provide for themselves and their families. This year, when President Obama gives his convention speech in North Carolina, we're going to hold him accountable for his record: look at what he accomplished versus what he said he would accomplish. Are you better off than you were four years ago — the last time President Obama gave a convention speech?" —Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 OBAMA: "You see, you see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country. We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage, whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma. We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was president..." (Barack Obama,

 "Other measures of the labor market in North Carolina tell a similar story. For example, the labor underutilization rate -the unemployed, people working part-time but preferring full-time work, as well as individuals marginally attached to the labor force (discouraged workers and "conditionally interested" workers) - averaged 17.9 percent during 2011."

 "In the next fiscal year, the military has outlined a $1.8 billion cut as part of a projected $48.7 billion health care budget covering 9.6 million people. The cuts would total $12.9 billion over five years. To offset the loss, retirees would pay higher enrollment fees based on how much they earn through their military pensions. Retirees and active-duty family members would pay more for pharmacy copayments, too." (Barrie Barber, "Military Retirees Could See Increase In Health Insurance Costs,"

 "Mercer, a human-resource consulting company in Charlotte, annually tracks health-insurance charges nationwide.
