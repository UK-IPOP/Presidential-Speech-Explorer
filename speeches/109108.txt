Verona, PA - Former Senator Rick Santorum announced today the recruitment of 189 caucus captains around the State of Iowa who serve as local organizers and ambassadors for the Santorum campaign. The extensive organization of the Santorum campaign reflects an equally extensive travel schedule and level of commitment to the State of Iowa. Santorum has visitedover 67 counties and has held 172 public events across the state, far more than any other presidential candidate.
Senator Santorum said: "I am honored to have such an outpouring of support from Iowa's conservative grassroots community. Our campaign has made it a point to travel to all areas of Iowa, not just the major media hubs, and the support we are announcing today makes it clear that we are focused on earning the votes of all Iowa Republicans. I am committed to the First-in-the-Nation Caucus State of Iowa, and I look forward to workingwith this great team as we move on to victory in the caucuses."
Cody Brown, Iowa State Director for the Santorum Campaign, said: "Rick Santorum has developed one of the most loyal supporter bases in the state, and we are proud to announce this esteemed and dedicated group of Iowa conservative leaders. This is a clear testament to Senator Santorum's consistent conservative message and a testament to the hard work Senator Santorum has put in our entire state. Rick Santorum has achieved more for the national conservative movement than any other candidate and Iowans are beginning to realize he's the one they have been waiting for."
In July, Santorum announced his Iowa Steering Committee, consisting of 25 conservative leaders in Iowa.
