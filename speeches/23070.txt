I AM unveiling today the design of the stamp which commemorates the Emancipation Proclamation 100 years ago which, of course, freed 3 million slaves.
This is an official stamp. And the new stamp will be issued in Chicago on August 16th, opening day of the Century of Negro Progress Exposition.
Mr. Olden, who designed the stamp and who is Vice President of McCann-Erickson, made this very dramatic symbol, I think, of what Mr. Lincoln accomplished with that.
I want to say it is a great pleasure to have this stamp which will be on a good many millions of letters and which will be a reminder of the extraordinary actions in the past as well as the business of the future.
We are glad to have the Postmaster here, Mr. Olden, and others who participated in the development of this reminder.
