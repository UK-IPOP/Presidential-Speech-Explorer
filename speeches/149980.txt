 Sir, are you going to Mississippi?
 Can't hear you.
Are you going to Mississippi?
 No, I've been talking to Mississippi. I've talked to the mayor. I've talked to the Congressman. And I've encouraged they—we have—we've offered every single thing available to Mississippi. The Governor has to act. There is money to deal with this problem. And—but I just—we're waiting for—we've given them EPA, the—well, we've given them everything there is to offer.
But you have no plans to go there. Is that correct?
 I have no plan to go there right now, no.
Mr. President, what is your response to conservatives who want to challenge your student loan plan in court?
 Who want to what?
Challenge your student loan plan in court.
 They have a right to do that.
Have you been briefed on Iran's response——
Actually, do you have a student loan since you—[
]?
Do I have a student loan? No. Do you, sir?
 No.
I'll bet you a lot of your staff does.
 Well, I—they may. I don't—no one's told me they have.
Have you been briefed on Iran's response to the U.S. proposal on the nuclear deal?
 I haven't gotten—I've been briefed, but unless something happened in the last 2 hours——
Yes.

They responded to—sure—they replied to the U.S. response.
 Yes, I haven't heard it yet. Okay? I'll find out when I walk in the door, I suspect.
Mr. President, what's your response to Afghans that are still stuck around the world and are wanting to come here to the U.S. and are trying to get here through the refugee program?
 Well, I think they have to—they're like everyone else trying to get here, and I think they have a right to try to get here. And if we can, we should accommodate them.
Thank you.
