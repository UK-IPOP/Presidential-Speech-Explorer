Earlier today, the White House released a 
 that details how the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal boosts clean energy jobs, strengthens resilience, and advances environmental justice. Axios Generate explored how the investments position us to move forward on tackling the climate crisis, including how the deal will build out electric vehicle charging infrastructure, invest in a clean power grid, drive clean energy technology and manufacturing forward, and more. These investments are a critical first step that will also help catalyze the historic climate investments in the President's Build Back Better Framework.

Is the newly passed infrastructure bill just small steps on climate or a BFD? The answer to both questions could be yes.
 The House voted late Friday to 
 to President Biden.
 The bill provides just "nominal" emissions cuts between now and 2030 compared to current policy, according to 
, a group led by Princeton energy expert Jesse Jenkins, in partnership with the firm Evolved Energy Research and Dartmouth's Erin Mayfield.
 "The bill contains very important innovation policy investments whose impacts are difficult to model, but enable deeper cuts in the 2030s and 2040s by helping drive improvement in key technologies like clean hydrogen, carbon capture, advanced nuclear and geothermal, and long duration storage," Jenkins told Axios via email.
 All eyes are now on bigger spending and tax legislation Democrats hope to move on a party-line vote soon.
