Unfortunately, although he's a friend of mine, Ted Cruz has spent the better part of the last two weeks making things up, about my record. On Planned Parenthood, so National Right to Life had to rebuke him. He had an ad pulled off the air because he was not being truthful about my position on sanctuary cities. He was not being truthful about my position on the definition of marriage, so, you know, you can't let those things stand.
