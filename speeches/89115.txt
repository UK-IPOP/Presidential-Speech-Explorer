 In the morning, President Bush toured GrafTech International, Ltd., and discussed the importance of investing in alternative energy research to reduce America's dependence on oil. He then had lunch with Cleveland business and community leaders at Slyman's Restaurant. In the afternoon, President Bush discussed his health care initiatives at the Cleveland Clinic. Later, he made remarks to the Greater Cleveland Partnership, the largest private-sector economic development organization in Ohio.
 GrafTech is a leader in manufacturing components for fuel cells, devices that directly convert chemical energy in hydrogen to electricity, with pure water and potentially useful heat as the only byproducts. This type of technology will help promote the use of hydrogen fuel and alternative fuels that are at the core of the President's "Twenty in Ten" plan to reduce projected U.S. gasoline consumption by 20 percent over the next ten years
 The Senate passed an energy bill at the end of June that includes some of the President's "Twenty in Ten" ideas, but they need improvement. The House of Representatives is considering energy legislation in July, and the President urges them to include his "Twenty in Ten" proposals:

) and other initiatives are helping give Medicare beneficiaries the ability to compare costs and results between hospitals.

    * Beginning last month, HHS made publicly available two new ways to measure the mortality rate for Medicare cardiac patients.

    * The Administration continues working to expand the use of electronic health records, which will help reduce costs and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of medical services.
 Instead of encouraging people to drop private coverage for government programs, the President believes we should work to make basic private health insurance affordable for all Americans. The best way to do this is by reforming the tax code to level the playing field so those who buy health insurance on their own get the same tax advantage as those who get health insurance through their jobs.
