IN SIGNING the Hospitalization Bill the President said:
"I have been very glad to sign the bill authorizing the construction over a term of years of further hospitals for war veterans.
"The load seems likely to still further increase and it is desirable that we should know the extent of it, and the policies which should be pursued. We are also in need of more coordination between different government agencies engaged in hospitalization. With view to an exhaustive examination of the subject I have asked General Hines to place the whole question before the Medical Council of the Veterans' Bureau for early study and report. The Council comprises eminent medical men from all parts of the country."
