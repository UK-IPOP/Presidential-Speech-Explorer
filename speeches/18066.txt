[Released May 12, 1953- Dated May 9, 1953]
- Dear General Ridgway:
I am today forwarding the attached letter to the Chairman of the Permanent Council requesting that appropriate action be taken at an early date to secure your release from assignment as Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, in order that your services may be available to fill the position of Chief of Staff, U.S. Army. I desire that you occupy that post as a matter of great interest to the United States and therefore feel fully justified in making this request.
If the Permanent Council requests the U.S. to furnish your successor, I am prepared, with the full agreement of my advisers, to nominate General Gruenther for that appointment.
By this communication I request that you, as SACEUR, agree to the early release of Admiral Carney from his appointment as Commander-in-Chief, South. I desire to inform the Permanent Council that it is my intention to appoint Admiral Carney as Chief of Naval Operations and therefore am withdrawing his services to N.A.T.O. with the agreement of the proper N.A.T.O. military authorities.
The question of the successor to the positions of Commanderin-Chief, South, and Chief of Staff, SHAPE, should be settled at a later date upon receipt of recommendations by SACEUR.
As to procedure on these changes, the Secretaries of State and Defense have recommended that previous procedures should be generally adhered to. I am sending Brigadier General Beebe to Pads to work with you and Ambassador Draper on fulfilling these matters.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
