 – Today, Texas Governor Greg Abbott 
. Greg Abbott was elected as the 48th Governor of Texas. Before serving as governor, Abbott was Texas' longest-serving Attorney General. Governor Abbott has spent his career fighting to preserve Texas values like faith, family and freedom for future generations. As the state's chief law enforcement official, Governor Abbott made protecting Texas communities the focus of his tenure serving as Attorney General.
In his 
 endorsement of Cruz, Abbott says why he's supporting Cruz for president, "it's our duty as Texas conservatives to support a leader we can trust to restore our values and move this country forward. That's why I'm supporting Ted Cruz for president."
Abbott continues, "Unlike far too many in Washington, the Ted Cruz we've seen in the Senate is the same Ted Cruz we elected. And he's the same Ted Cruz I served with when I was Attorney General and Ted was Solicitor General."
Cruz was selected to be Solicitor General of Texas by Abbott when he was Attorney General. Cruz and Abbott have worked together on a multitude of issues. They've joined together to fight illegal immigration and protect our borders in order to keep our nation safe. As Governor, Abbott has a strong record of conservative leadership. He has worked to create jobs and economic opportunity, improve education, build transportation infrastructure and securing Texas' border in the face of federal government inaction.
"Greg is a man of unwavering principle," said Cruz. "He is a strong leader in the state of Texas and has served Texans well during his time has Attorney General and as now as governor. Greg has a consistent and stalwart record of fighting for conservative principles. I am glad to call Greg a friend and honored to have his support in this race."
