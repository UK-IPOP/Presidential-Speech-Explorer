A little-noticed health care provision that Senator Marco Rubio of Florida slipped into a giant spending law last year has tangled up the Obama administration, sent tremors through health insurance markets and rattled confidence in the durability of President Obama's signature health law. . . .

Mr. Rubio's efforts against the so-called risk corridor provision of the health law has hardly risen to the forefront of the race for the Republican presidential nomination, but his plan limiting how much the government can spend to protect insurance companies against financial losses has shown the effectiveness of quiet legislative sabotage.
Only one candidate has actually done significant damage to Obamacare.

Mr. Rubio's point is bumper-sticker ready. The payments are "a taxpayer-funded bailout for insurance companies."
