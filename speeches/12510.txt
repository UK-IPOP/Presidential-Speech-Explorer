 the preamble to Public Resolution 123, 74th Congress, approved June 23, 1936, recites:
 the service rendered the United States by the American mother is the greatest source of the country's strength and inspiration; and
 we honor ourselves and the mothers of America when we revere and give emphasis to the home as the fountainhead of the state; and
 the American mother is doing so much for the home and for the moral and spiritual uplift of the people of the United States and hence so much for good government and humanity; and
 the American Gold Star Mothers suffered the supreme sacrifice of motherhood in the loss of their sons and daughters in the World War;
 the said Public Resolution 123 provides:
That the President of the United States is hereby authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the Government officials to display the United States flag on all Government buildings, and the people of the United States to display the flag and to hold appropriate meetings at their homes, churches, or other suitable places, on the last Sunday in September, as a public expression of the love, sorrow, and reverence of the people of the United States for the American Gold Star Mothers.
Sec. 2. That the last Sunday in September shall hereafter be designated and known as "Gold Star Mother's Day", and it shall be the duty of the President to request its observance as provided for in this resolution.
, President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the aforesaid public resolution, do by this proclamation designate Sunday, September 26, 1937, as Gold Star Mother's Day and direct Government officials to display the United States flag on all Government buildings, and do call upon the people of the United States to display the flag and to hold appropriate meetings at their homes, churches, or other suitable places on that day as a public expression of the affection and reverence of the people of the United States for the American Gold Star Mothers.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 10th day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-second.
FRANKLIN D ROOSEVELT
By the President:
