Mr. Prime Minister:
It is with the greatest personal pleasure that I welcome you to the United States.
My interest in your country and its state goes back a number of years, and, therefore, I take particular pleasure in welcoming the head of state of a new country which stretches back through history for thousands of years and which has a great place to play now not only in North Africa, but throughout all of the world.
I am particularly glad to have you here as a strong patriot who has given many indications under the most difficult circumstances of your devotion to your country and your love for freedom. So, Mr. Prime Minister, we are glad to have you and the members of your government.
We hope this visit here will give you an opportunity to make a judgment of the United States and its people and also recognize the hand of friendship which we extend to the people of Algeria in this common desire to maintain our national independence and the peace of the world.
Mr. Prime Minister, we are very proud to have you here.
