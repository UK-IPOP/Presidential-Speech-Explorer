 the preamble to Senate Concurrent Resolution 18, Sixty-ninth Congress (44 Stat. 1982), passed June 4, 1926, recites:
 the 11th of November, 1918, marked the cessation at the most destructive. sanguinary, and far-reaching war in human annals and the resumption by the people of the United States of peaceful relations with other nations, which we hope may never again be severed; and
 it Is fitting that the recurring anniversary of this date should be commemorated with thanksgiving and prayer and exercises designed to perpetuate peace through good will and mutual understanding between nations; and
 the legislatures of twenty-seven of our States have already declared November 11 to be a legal holiday:
 the said Concurrent Resolution provides:
That the President of the United States is requested to issue a proclamation nailing upon the officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on November 11 and inviting the people of the United States to observe the day in schools and churches, or other suitable places, with appropriate ceremonies expressive of our gratitude for peace and our desire for the continuance of friendly relations with all other peoples.
, President of the United States of America, do hereby direct that on November 11, 1936, the eighteenth anniversary of the Armistice, the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings, and do invite the people of the United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies in schools and churches, or other suitable places
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 27th day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-first.
FRANKLIN D ROOSEVELT
