I lay before the Congress herewith a report submitted by the commission which visited Liberia in pursuance of the provisions of the deficiency act of March 4, 1909, "to investigate the interests of the United States and its citizens in the Republic of Liberia, with the consent of the authorities of said Republic."
This report is accompanied by a communication of the Secretary of State reciting the conditions under which the Liberian commonwealth was founded through the efforts of the Government of the United States and American citizens, and commenting on the recommendations of the commission touching the course to be pursued by this Government in aid of Liberia at this juncture of stress and need. I cordially concur in the views of the Secretary of State and trust that the policy of the United States toward Liberia will be so shaped as to fulfill our national duty to the Liberian people who, by the efforts of this Government and through the material enterprise of American citizens, were established on the African coast and set on the pathway to sovereign statehood.
