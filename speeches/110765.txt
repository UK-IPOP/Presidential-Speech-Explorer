Verona, PA - The differences between Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney on health care are stark. But there are almost no differences between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama on heath care. Mitt Romney authored and has been a stalwart defender of the top-down, government run Massachusetts health care law that served as the framework of the disaster known as ObamaCare.
Hogan Gidley, National Communications Director, said: "As Governor Tim Pawlenty so aptly said, RomneyCare should be called ObamneyCare. Everyone knows that Governor Romney's top down government run mandated health insurance plan was the basis of ObamaCare.
Oddly enough, the only accomplishment that Gov. Romney points to and actually defends during his tenure as Governor - is the most liberal, the most intrusive and unconstitutional. In fact, the only area conservatives would appreciate Romney flip-flopping on would be RomneyCare. So why he doubles down on this liberal accomplishment instead of just flip-flopping as usual is beyond me. We're all looking for Gov. Romney to finally have firm conviction on something, but it's pretty telling that he picks RomneyCare."
Following the most recent Republican Presidential Debate, Grace-Marie Turner in the 
 outlined why Romney's defense of the indefensible simply didn't work.
