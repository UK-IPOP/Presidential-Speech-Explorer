IN THE TRAGIC DEATH of President Magsaysay, the people of the Philippine Republic, as well as those of the United States and the entire free world, have lost a valiant champion of freedom. I had been looking forward to meeting with President Magsaysay in Washington, to re-affirm the close and affectionate ties all Americans have with his people.
A staunch advocate of independence for his people, President Magsaysay was also an active and determined fighter against communism. He will be greatly missed.
Mrs. Eisenhower and I extend to his family not only our personal sympathies but also the heartfelt sympathies of all Americans, who have lost a good friend.
