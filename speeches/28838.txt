Dear Cabot:
It is with great regret that I accept your resignation as head of the U.S. Delegation at the Paris Meetings on Vietnam. I could have asked for no better representative, and will miss your counsel and efforts as we seek to negotiate a just peace in Vietnam.

You have the satisfaction of knowing that you have done all that imagination and dedication to peace could accomplish.
Please accept my warmest thanks for your service to the Nation in this demanding job.
It is reassuring that you have agreed to serve as an advisor so that I will continue to have the benefit of your experience and wisdom on Vietnam. With best personal regards,
Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
[The Honorable Henry Cabot Lodge, Head of
U.S. Delegation to the Paris Meetings on Viet-
nam, American Embassy, Paris, France]
