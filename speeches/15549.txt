THE REPORT of the President's Committee on Religion and Welfare in the Armed Forces is the first complete appraisal of these important programs since World War II. I am confident it will provide an invaluable guide for our expanding Armed Forces in the days to come and serve as a basis for allocating adequate funds for these essential services.
It is clear from the report that our Armed Forces are making good progress in the efforts to build strong unit and individual morale through the provision of worthwhile opportunities for service men and women to use their free time in constructive ways. However, the Committee has specifically pointed out a number of ways in which improvement can be effected.
I regret that the Congress has not seen fit to provide funds for the continuance of the work of the President's Committee on Religion and Welfare in the Armed Forces. The Committee has produced impartial appraisals on many important aspects of life in the Armed Forces, and it has helped to promote and secure constructive activities for service men and women through its work in civilian communities located near installations of the Armed Forces.
