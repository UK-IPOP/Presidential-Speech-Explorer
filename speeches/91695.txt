The Clinton Campaign today announced its Oregon Steering Committee, made up of local leaders from across the state that will lead the campaign's efforts in Oregon.
"I believe Hillary Clinton has what it takes to get us out of Iraq and back on track in tackling our real priorities," said Portland City Commissioner Erik Sten. "Our families need healthcare, early education and jobs that make a living wage. By investing in American ingenuity to stop global warming, we can build an economy and place in the world that is sustainable. Hillary will do the hard work in Washington that we need to be successful in Oregon."
"Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to deliver the change we need, and is far and away the best-qualified person running for President," said Josh Kardon, Chair of the Oregon Steering Committee. "That's a big reason she was able to attract so many talented Oregonians from across the state to lead her Oregon campaign. From Umatilla County to Clackamas, from Jackson County to Douglas, from Lane County to Multnomah, Hillary's Oregon steering committee is unrivaled in representing the true diversity of our state."
"I'm honored to have the support of this distinguished group of leaders from across Oregon," Clinton said. "With their help, we can bring our message of change throughout Oregon and the nation."
