TONIGHT I will be going to Camp David, at the conclusion of the day, with certain staff members.
Tomorrow morning, I will have breakfast there with Ambassador Bunker, Secretary Rusk, and Secretary Clifford.
Ambassador Bunker will arrive at Andrews in the early morning, somewhere around 7 o'clock. He will pick up the two Secretaries and come on to Camp David for a meeting there tomorrow.

I have a message from Hanoi replying to our message of April 3d. We have taken steps to notify our allies.
We shall be trying to work out promptly a time and place for talks.
Any other announcements will have to come from Mr. Christian, if there is anything else to announce.
