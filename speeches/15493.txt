IT IS a pleasure to greet you. Such trips as this do much for international goodwill. It is also great for educational purposes, because you had to inform yourselves thoroughly and completely on the country you were going to visit, and when you got there you found out that those people have the same ideals and are trying to do just exactly what we are: that is, to make their country a good place in which to live.
I am glad you took the trip. I hope these trips will be continued, and I hope that every State in the Union will have a chance to have representatives visit some of our neighbors, and find out just what goes on across the line. It has been a pleasure to have you here.
