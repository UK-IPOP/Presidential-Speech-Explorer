CIRCULAR.
DEPARTMENT OF STATE,
SIR: It is my great misfortune to be obliged to inform you of an event not less afflicting to the people of the United States than distressing to my own feelings and the feelings of all those connected with the Government.
The President, Zachary Taylor, departed this life yesterday at half-past 10 o'clock in the evening.
You are respectfully invited to attend the funeral ceremonies, which will take place on Saturday next, and with the particular arrangements for which you will be made acquainted in due time.
Not doubting your sympathy and condolence with the Government and people of the country on this bereavement, I have the honor to be, sir, with high consideration, your obedient servant,
JOHN M. CLAYTON.
