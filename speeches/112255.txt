"Four years ago, President Obama claimed he would keep 'America's promise' as president – but, after three and a half years in office, he's forgotten to keep his own promises to voters. From record unemployment to declining middle-class incomes, President Obama has repeatedly demonstrated he doesn't have what it takes to get our economy moving again." –Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson

 OBAMA: "So today, I'm laying out a comprehensive agenda to reclaim our dream and restore our prosperity. It's an agenda that focuses on three broad economic challenges that the next President must address - the current housing crisis; the cost crisis facing the middle-class and those struggling to join it; and the need to create millions of good jobs right here in America- jobs that can't be outsourced and won't disappear." (Senator Barack Obama, 
, Janesville, WI, 2/13/08)
 OBAMA: "The second major economic challenge we have to address is the cost crisis facing the middle-class and the working poor. As the housing crisis spills over into other parts of the economy, we've seen people's entire life savings wiped out in an instant. It's the result of skyrocketing costs, stagnant wages, and disappearing benefits that are pushing more and more Americans towards a debt spiral from which they can't escape. We have to give them a way out by cutting costs, putting more money in their pockets, and rebuilding a safety net that's become badly frayed over the last decades." (Senator Barack Obama, 
, Janesville, WI, 2/13/08)
 OBAMA: "For those Americans who are facing the brunt of the housing crisis, I've proposed a fund that would provide direct relief to victims of mortgage fraud. We'd also help those who are facing closure refinance their mortgages so they can stay in their homes." (Senator Barack Obama, 
, Janesville, WI, 2/13/08)
 "Foreclosure starts -- meaning default notices or scheduled foreclosure auctions, depending on the state -- also rose in May, increasing 12 percent from April and 16 percent compared with the year-ago period." (Ilyce Glink, "Foreclosures Spike In May," 
, 6/14/12)
 OBAMA: "If we want to train our workforce for a knowledge economy, it's also time that we brought down the cost of a college education and put it within reach of every American." (Senator Barack Obama, 
, Janesville, WI, 2/13/08)
