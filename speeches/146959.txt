The Saudi Foreign Minister says he didn't hear you accuse the Crown Prince of Khashoggi's murder. Is he telling the truth?
 Is the Saudi Foreign Minister lying, President Biden? The Saudi Foreign Minister says he didn't hear you accuse the Crown Prince of Khashoggi's murder. Is he telling the truth?
 No.
Do you regret the fist bump, Mr. President?
 Why don't you guys talk about something that matters? I'm happy to answer a question that matters.
Will inflation go down from here, Mr. President?
 I'm hoping. We'll know in the next few weeks.
President Biden, will you be honoring your campaign pledge to release all the marijuana inmates in prison?
 I don't think there should—I don't think anyone in—anyone should be in prison for the use of marijuana. We're working on the crime bill.
Thank you.
