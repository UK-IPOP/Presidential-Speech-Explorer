Mr. President, Madame Diori, Mr. Vice president, Mr. Under Secretary of State, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen:
Tonight we are honored to greet not one but three Presidents.
President Diori is first and foremost the President of his country.
He is also President of a group of 14 French-speaking nations that are cooperating for common progress.
Finally, he is President of a council of five neighboring West African nations that are sharing natural assets and development goals.
Your land, Mr. President, is larger than Texas and California together. It is equally vast in potential.
You have not spent your natural treasure on showy government mansions. Instead, you have doubled your cropland since 1955. That is solid progress, the kind of progress that Americans admire and encourage.
But you have other equal priorities. You cherish political freedom. You have rejected the deceptive "convenience" of one-man rule for the more strenuous, but infinitely more satisfying, life of democracy.
The force of your examples and beliefs, Mr. President, also make you a vital force for African unity. Your vision and practicality have inspired the firm fruits of partnership--the common sugar market--the airline--the postal and telecommunications union--the mutual aid and guarantee fund-development plans for the two great water systems of West Africa.
These are first and critical steps. They foretell a uniquely African fusion of independence and cooperation. They promise to transform the continent--and to establish our guest as the quiet man of destiny in the emergence of a new Africa.
Join me now in a toast to that man and to that future. I am proud to pay tribute to a great leader and a great unifier, President Diori--to his lady--and to all the people of their beloved Republic and continent.
