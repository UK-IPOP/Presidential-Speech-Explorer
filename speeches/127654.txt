"The new public data confirming the Russians are behind the hack of John Podesta's email is a big deal. There is no longer any doubt that Putin is trying to help Donald Trump by weaponizing WikiLeaks. Despite all the evidence, including the conclusions of the US intelligence community, Donald Trump went on the debate stage and acted as Putin's puppet, defending Russia and refusing to admit and condemn the Kremlin's actions. This behavior has gone from bizarre to disqualifying. In light of his associate's admitted 'back-channeling' with Assange, and Trump's own undisclosed business ties with Russia, it's time for Trump to tell the American people what he knew about these hacks and when he knew it."
