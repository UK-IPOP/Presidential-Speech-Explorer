THE LINKING of the various countries of the world by rapid communications is a means for the enhancing of closer friendly relations, and the importance of which our peoples realize more and more as advances are made. It therefore gives me great pleasure to be able to inaugurate with you this new direct radio telegraph service between Austria and the United States.
