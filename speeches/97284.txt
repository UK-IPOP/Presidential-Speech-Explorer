On the eve of the pivotal Pennsylvania primary, the Clinton Campaign today announced the addition of 20 prominent Oregonians -- including 10 women elected officials -- to Hillary Clinton's Oregon Steering Committee. These local leaders will help guide the campaign's grassroots outreach across Oregon.
"These endorsements come on the heels of Hillary's visit to Oregon and the campaign's efforts to reach out to voters across the state. These community leaders have had the opportunity to see both candidates in Oregon up close, and they have chosen to support the candidate who spoke to Oregon's issues, who understands Oregon's needs and who has the experience to work with our state to get things done," said Josh Kardon, Chair of the Oregon Steering Committee. "The more Oregonians hear about Hillary's ideas for our state, the stronger her support grows."
"I am thrilled that these respected community leaders have chosen to join my campaign and help carry our message to the people of Oregon," said Clinton. "With their help, we can set about tackling the challenges facing Oregon and our nation."
