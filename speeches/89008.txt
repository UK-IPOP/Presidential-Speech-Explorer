 Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced the Florida chapter of Young Professionals for Mitt. Comprised of 41 men and women, this group will help build Governor Romney's base of political and financial support among young professionals in the Sunshine State.
"These young professionals will be a driving force behind our Florida efforts to expand our growing base of grassroots support. With their help, I am confident that we will be able to spread our message of conservative change across this great state," said Governor Romney.
Leading Governor Romney's Florida Young Professionals for Mitt chapter as Honorary Chair is State Representative Anitere Flores, also a Statewide Co-Chair of Governor Romney's Florida Steering Committee. The chapter's Statewide Chairs are Brian Graham, Sara Misselhorn and Rita Nunez.
Joining Romney for President as a Chair of the Florida Young Professionals for Mitt, Brian Graham said, "In the private and public sectors, Governor Romney has a proven record of leadership and success. He has made the toughest decisions in the most difficult situations, and in the process, turned around businesses, the Olympics and the state of Massachusetts. I am proud to join my fellow Florida young professionals in supporting Governor Romney in his bid for the Presidency."
Additionally, young professionals serving on Governor Romney's Florida Finance Committee include Ward Blakely, Chris and Susanne Dudley, Erik Kirk, Trey McCarley and Rhett O'Doski.
