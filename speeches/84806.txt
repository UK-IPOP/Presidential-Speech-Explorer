 After touring the factory, the President called on Congress to pass CAFTA to support American jobs and democracy and security in Central America and the Dominican Republic.
 Increased global trade means that American textile firms need to take advantage of regional opportunities for exports and growth. The National Council of Textile Organizations endorses CAFTA, which will help level the playing field for American firms by eliminating existing duties on American products. This will save jobs and make U.S. exports much more competitive.
 CAFTA will instantly eliminate tariffs on 80 percent of U.S.-manufactured goods, and the remainder of tariffs will be phased out within a few years. As a result, manufacturers and workers will benefit from increased sales of information technology; farm, construction, medical, and scientific equipment; paper products; and pharmaceuticals.
 As American agricultural productivity increases, our farmers and ranchers rely more and more on exports. Twenty-seven percent of their income currently comes from exports.
 By passing CAFTA, we will help continue the transformation of the Americas into a more peaceful, democratic, and prosperous hemisphere. By bringing economic growth to Central America and the Dominican Republic, CAFTA will boost demand for U.S. goods, reduce poverty, discourage illegal immigration, raise working standards, and deliver hope and opportunity to people who have made the choice for freedom.
