The difference in substance between Rubio and Trump on SocSec is staggering.

— Ed Morrissey (@EdMorrissey) 
Really strong answer by Rubio on the budget gap not being closed by waste, fraud & abuse & foreign aid.

— Philip Klein (@philipaklein) 
Strong, strong answer by Rubio here. 


— Guy Benson (@guypbenson) 
Rubio ran on entitlement reform in 2010 — challenging the GOP establishment, which advised strongly against it. Knows the issue. 


— Stephen Hayes (@stephenfhayes) 
Rubio says "the numbers don't add up" on Trump's entitlement plan. Trump declines to hit back.

— Sabrina Siddiqui (@SabrinaSiddiqui) 
Rubio maybe the best messenger in the GOP on entitlements. Won in Florida in 2010 running on that message when party said run away from Ryan

— John McCormack (@McCormackJohn) 
This is a totally substantive debate so far, and Trump has been exposed as knowing very little about anything. His campaign is over, folks.

— Jon Ralston (@RalstonReports) 
Rubio stood for brassy entitlement reform all the way back when he ran for Senate—when it was still taboo.
