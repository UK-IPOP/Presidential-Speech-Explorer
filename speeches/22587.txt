Dear Mr. ___________
In addressing the Congress last week, I pledged my Administration to the utmost of thrift and frugality, and to get a dollar's value for every dollar spent.
I have directed the heads of all Government agencies to accelerate immediately their efforts to operate their programs at the lowest possible cost. The Secretary of Defense has already established a cost reduction program aimed at achieving annual savings of $4 billion, through efforts now in process or planned by fiscal year 1967, and he has further committed his Department to realizing $1.5 billion of these savings in the current fiscal year. More than 55 cents out of each Defense dollar is spent by its contractors. It is for this reason that I am calling on you 'personally to assist me and the Secretary in achieving further significant reductions in Defense expenditures.
It is my desire that you establish an affirmative program of cost reduction in the performance of Defense contracts, both those which you now hold and those which you may subsequently receive. If you already have such a program in being, then I call on you to accelerate, expand, and intensify this effort.
I have asked the Secretary of Defense to take into account the accomplishments of contractors who successfully reduce the cost of Defense procurement, when making future source selections, and in determining profit and fee rates on noncompetitive negotiated contracts.
I have also discussed this program with the Director of the Budget and the Comptroller General.
The Secretary of Defense's letter elaborating this program is enclosed. It has my fullest endorsement.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
