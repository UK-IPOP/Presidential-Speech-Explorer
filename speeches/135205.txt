Our Nation depends on a robust water infrastructure system and continued access to safe, secure, and affordable sources of water. We need it to grow our crops and produce food for the world, extract and process minerals, generate electricity, and manufacture products we use in our everyday lives. As we mark World Water Day, the Trump Administration remains committed to enhanced water security. That is why the President's National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) today released its 


Sudden events such as droughts, floods, hurricanes, and other hazards impact our water infrastructure and our ability to supply safe and clean sources of water. In fact, 40 out of 50 State water managers expect freshwater shortages to occur in their State within the next 10 years, according to a 2014 
. The Trump Administration is ready to address these challenges and the NSTC's plan is the latest effort to ensure our Nation has continued access to secure and reliable water supplies.

Beyond the initiatives outlined above, every American can help improve our Nation's water security through conservation. Increased water conservation efforts by both users and water utilities are among the most cost-effective ways to reduce demand and improve water security. In addition to conservation, continued development of new and innovative technologies is needed to support access to clean, potable water in order to ensure rural and urban prosperity, national and economic security, and health for all Americans. Together we can solve the future water availability and security challenges that our Nation faces.
