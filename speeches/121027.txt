 this morning where he discussed the removal of the confederate flag, the Supreme Court's decision on same-sex marriage and protecting religious liberties.
As highlighted by 
, Senator Graham also discussed what it would mean for the GOP in 2016 to embrace a constitutional amendment on marriage and why he will concentrate on protecting religious liberties. Graham stated on Sunday, "You can put it in the platform but it will hurt us in 2016, because it's a process that's not going to bear fruit. What I want to do is protect the religious liberties of those who believe that opposing same-sex marriage is a part of their faith."
