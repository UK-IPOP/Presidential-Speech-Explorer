Greetings from an overcast Wilmington.
Just to let you know that the original pool call time of 12 has been pushed to 3 pm. No changes announced to the presidentâ€™s schedule which is as follows:
Greetings from a still overcast Wilmington.
The White House announced that the president will be returning to JBA tomorrow morning instead of the previous plan which had him back tonight.
Our call time here has also been pushed back to 4:00 pm.
From the White House press office: "The President spoke with Speaker McCarthy this afternoon to congratulate him."
Your pool, Covid tested already, is being swept by Secret Service at the cutout near POTUS's home. No official word this Saturday afternoon on the president's plans.
At 5:01 pm POTUS motorcade is rolling out from his home road.
At 5:04 pm the motorcade arrived at St Joseph on the Brandywine Roman Catholic church. The president, followed by several other people who couldn't be identified, strode through the crepuscular gloom into the church.
Pool holding.
At 5:56 pm, the president left church, followed by people who could not be identified in the dull, yellow light cast from the open church door. On this this raw, starless Delaware evening, he wasted no time getting back to his limo.
Sartorial note: President Biden wore what through the twilight appeared to be a tan suit.
And the motorcade is rolling.
At 6 pm, pool saw the POTUS motorcade peel off into his residence. The White House declared a lid.
