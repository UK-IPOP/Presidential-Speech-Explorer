ONE YEAR AGO today, the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty came into force. Upon deposit of separate instruments of ratification, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and the United States consummated a solemn pledge not to test nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, in outer space, and in the oceans. The world embarked on the first step to remove the threat of oblivion that for two decades has stalked the earth.
More than 100 nations have now signed the test ban treaty. The air is cleaner, the world is safer, and the hopes for peace are a little brighter because of this act of commonsense. Next week, I will report to the Nation on our progress under the test ban treaty.
This weekend, in our homes and houses of worship throughout the land, I think it appropriate that all Americans pause to mark in gratitude, in pride, and in prayer the historic anniversary we now observe.
