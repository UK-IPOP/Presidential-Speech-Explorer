His Excellency

Amintore Fanfani

Secretary General of the Christian Democratic Party
Thank you for your gracious and thoughtful message. I am sure that the many Americans who met you during your tour of this country feel, as I do, that visits like yours by the leaders of Italian democracy further strengthen the already close friendship between our two peoples. It was a particular pleasure for me to meet you.
