I GREATLY REGRET that I cannot accept your kind invitation to be present at the ceremonies attending the unveiling of the bust of President James Madison at the Hall of Fame on Thursday or to make an address by radio. Ceremonies of this character are a noble inspiration to the young and they help us all to keep alive the great tradition of our self-government by recalling the parts played by the great men and women of American history whose participation in public affairs shaped our ideals and moulded our institutions.
