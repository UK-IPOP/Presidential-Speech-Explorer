Pool Reports by 
, 
Good morning from a chilly and very rainy Wilmington.
The call time for the pool is noon.
We have no additional guidance on President Biden's plans for the day, but I'll update if that changes.
As a reminder, guidance from the WH for Biden's sked is below:
Pool call time here in Wilmington was noon.
And the WH has called a lunch lid until 2 p.m.
Weather here is cool and cloudy, but it's not currently raining. (So, not ideal golfing weather but perhaps better than it was this morning, if anyone is considering a round of golf in Wilmington, and I'm not saying anyone is.)
?The WH called a travel/photo lid at 1:59 p.m.
