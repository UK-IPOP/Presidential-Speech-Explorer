CITATION TO ACCOMPANY

THE MEDAL OF FREEDOM

TO

DR. JOHN VON NEUMANN

FOR EXCEPTIONALLY MERITORIOUS SERVICE

IN FURTHERANCE OF

THE SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES
Dr. von Neumann, in a series of scientific study projects of major national significance, has materially increased the scientific progress of this country in the armaments field.
Through his work on various highly classified missions performed outside the continental limits of the United States in conjunction with critically important international programs, Dr. von Neumann has resolved some of the most difficult technical problems of national defense.
In recognition of his many services to his country, it is my pleasure to award Dr. von Neumann the Medal of Freedom.
