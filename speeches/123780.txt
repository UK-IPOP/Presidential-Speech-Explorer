Kasich worked hard for the Dixville Notch vote and was one of the few candidates to make the long trek to New Hampshire's North Country to campaign. He later called each of Dixville Notch's voters to personally ask them for their support.
"It is an honor to earn the support of people who celebrate democracy as faithfully and famously as the voters in Dixville Notch. New Hampshire rewards hard work and a positive campaign and that defines what our team has done here. We're going to work hard until all the polls close to continue our success throughout New Hampshire and then take the campaign to South Carolina and beyond," said Kasich.
