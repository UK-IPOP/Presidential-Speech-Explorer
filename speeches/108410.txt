AUSTIN - The Perry campaign today released a 30-second television advertisement, "Lazy," which is airing over national cable and Iowa broadcast and cable.
Video of President Obama: "We've been a little bit lazy I think over the last couple of decades."
Rick Perry: "Can you believe that? That's what our President thinks is wrong with America? That Americans are lazy?"
"That's pathetic. It's time to clean house in Washington."
"It's time for a Balanced Budget Amendment that forces Washington to stop overspending."
"If Congress balks, cut their pay and send them home."
"Obama's socialist policies are bankrupting America. We must stop him now."
"I'm Rick Perry. I approve this message."
