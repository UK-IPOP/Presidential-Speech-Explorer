IT IS with profound regret that I have learned this morning of the passing of Representative Richard M. Simpson, a veteran and distinguished legislator who for many years has courageously and conscientiously served his District, the Nation and the Republican Party.
Mrs. Eisenhower and I join Americans all across the country in tending deepest sympathy to his family. His passing is a grievous loss to our nation, and a personal loss to me.
