AUSTIN — The Perry campaign today released a 30-second television advertisement entitled "American Story," which will air on national cable and Iowa broadcast and cable.
Mrs. Perry: "It's an old-fashioned American story. I married my high school sweetheart, but first I had to wait as he volunteered for the Air Force and flew planes all over the world."
"I'm Anita Perry. When Rick's tour of duty as a captain in the Air Force ended, he returned home to farm with his dad and asked me to marry him."
"We grew up in small towns, raised with Christian values — values we still believe in. And we know Washington, D.C., could use some of that."
Gov. Perry: "I'm Rick Perry, and I really approve this message."
