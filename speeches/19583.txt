His Excellency

Kliment Efremovich Voroshilov

Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet

Socialist Republics Moscow
In behalf of the American people, I reciprocate the greetings of yourself, Prime Minister Bulganin and Mr. Khrushchev. I hope that the peoples of the Soviet Union throughout the coming year may enjoy peace and those fundamentals of a more abundant life which are the aspirations of all mankind. I earnestly trust that the New Year will bring a firmer and better understanding between the citizens of the Soviet Union, the American people and those of other nations. You may be assured that the government of the United States will extend every effort to that end.
