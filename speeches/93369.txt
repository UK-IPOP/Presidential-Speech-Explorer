"The Senate passed another SCHIP bill with major flaws, especially its failure to cover poor children first. Congress has known for weeks that the President would veto this bill. â€¦ Like the previous bill, this bill also shifts children with private insurance onto the government rolls, uses taxpayers' dollars to subsidize middle class families, and raises taxes. It does all this while costing even more over the next five years than the version the President previously vetoed."
 (Robert Pear, "Expecting Presidential Veto, Senate Passes Child Health Measure,"

 Instead, the House of Representatives made a few adjustments at the margins of the vetoed bill and passed it again.
