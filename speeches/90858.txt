 "Former Mass. Gov. Mitt Romney, who I think won the debate, was best prepared to answer the question. He suggested everyone had to pitch in to help the economy, including business and government. He recognized the need to fix schools, invest in technology, encourage free trade and keep taxes down. He took a shot at Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, a Democrat, by jokingly suggesting he was 'nervous she would put a tax on the debate.'" (John Fout, "Middle Class Can't Read GOP's Lips In Debate," The Street.com,

 "Romney delivered the line of the debate with his analysis of the actor's entry onto the stage. 'Is this our sixth debate, I think, something like that?' Romney began. 'This is a lot like "Law & Order," Senator. It has a huge cast, the series seems to go on forever, and Fred Thompson shows up at the end.'" (Brett Hovell and Christine Byun, "Romney Vs. Giuliani On Taxes," ABC News,
