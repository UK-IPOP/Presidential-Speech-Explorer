BECAUSE we have been successful, through our voluntary agriculture programs, in eliminating the burdensome grain surplus that existed in 1961, I was able recently (May 5) to announce a 15 percent increase in the national wheat acreage allotment for the 1967 crop.
Secretary Freeman has noted that this was a historically significant event which signaled the beginning of a new flexibility and adaptiveness in our great agricultural production plan. It demonstrated our ability, under the Food and Agriculture Act of 1965, to adjust supply to global and domestic demand. I have instructed Secretary Freeman to look further at this time into the likely supply and demand situation for next year.
