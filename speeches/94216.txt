: 
 SEN. OBAMA: "If John McCain, for example, is the nominee, I respect that John McCain in the first two rounds of Bush tax cuts said it is irresponsible; that we have never before cut taxes at the same time as we are going into war. And somewhere along the line the Straight Talk Express lost some wheels -- (laughter) -- and now he is in favor of extending Bush tax cuts that went to some of the wealthiest Americans, who don't need them and were not even asking for them." (CNN, Democrat Presidential Candidate Debate, Los Angeles, CA, 1/31/08)
 MR. BLITZER: "We have a follow-up, Senator Obama. In an interview with CNN this week, you said this. You said, quote, 'I stood up for a humane and intelligent immigration policy in a way that frankly none of my other opponents did.' What did you mean by that?" SEN. OBAMA: "Well, what I meant was that when this issue came up, not driver's license but comprehensive immigration reform generally, I worked with Ted Kennedy, I worked with Dick Durbin, I worked with John McCain - although he may not admit it now - (laughter) - to move this issue forward aggressively." (CNN, Democrat Presidential Candidate Debate, Los Angeles, CA, 1/31/08)
 MR. BLITZER: "... Senator Clinton respond, but were you missing in action when Senator Obama and Senator McCain and Senator Kennedy started formulating comprehensive immigration reform?" SEN. CLINTON: "Well, actually, I cosponsored comprehensive immigration reform in 2004, before Barack came to the Senate. (Cheers, applause.) So I have been on record on behalf of this for quite some time." (CNN, Democrat Presidential Candidate Debate, Los Angeles, CA, 1/31/08)
