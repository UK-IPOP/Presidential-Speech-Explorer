 One year ago today, Southeast Louisiana was struck by a cruel hurricane and flooding on a massive scale. Less than three weeks later, with many homes, churches, and schools still under water, the President pledged that the Federal government would do its part to rebuild New Orleans and Southeast Louisiana. The President has returned to New Orleans to reiterate his commitment and to report what the Federal government is doing to make good on its promises. However, the one-year anniversary is not the finish line, and many challenges still remain.
 The Federal government has committed more than $110 billion to help the Gulf Coast, and most of this money has already been sent to the region. The President also put Don Powell in charge of coordinating Federal support for local rebuilding.
 Thousands of businesses were hurt, tens of thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed, lives were lost, and hundreds of thousands of citizens were forced to flee. Some citizens still do not know whether they will have a neighborhood to come back to, others have spent the past year living in trailers, and many now find themselves without jobs, struggling to make do without normal conveniences, and fearing for their safety because of violent criminals.
 The Coast Guard and National Guard stepped up to bring relief, and we saw acts of selflessness in every parish.
 At the President's direction, every department of the Administration looked at its response to last year's hurricanes and recommended practical reforms. Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff has increased FEMA's manpower and training, strengthened partnerships with the Red Cross and the Department of Defense, improved communications among State, local, and Federal emergency teams, and expanded supplies so we can feed up to 1 million people for about a week. FEMA is now under the leadership of Undersecretary R. David Paulison, who has more than 30 years of emergency management experience.
 The Administration has secured nearly $6 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers to repair and enhance the levees, make the entire hurricane protection system better and stronger by 2010, and begin to restore the wetlands surrounding the Greater New Orleans area. We are replacing I-walls with T-walls that have stronger foundations, storm-proofing pumping stations and increasing their capacity, and elevating electrical systems.
 To help clear remaining debris, the Federal government will continue to pay full reimbursement costs through the end of the year for the five hardest-hit parishes.
 Just 19 days after the Louisiana Recovery Authority presented its Road Home plan in May, the Administration approved it, and the Administration has committed more than $10 billion in Federal money to make it work. Under this program, eligible homeowners will receive up to $150,000 for damage not covered by insurance or other Federal assistance. The President calls on State authorities to quickly get these dollars into citizens' hands.
 The President believes in local and State control of schools. Louisiana officials recognize the New Orleans school system needs to change, and the Federal government is helping them implement a new approach.
 GO Zones give entrepreneurs and small business owners special tax incentives to invest, create jobs, and help jumpstart the local economy.
 The work ahead includes making the streets of New Orleans safer, building new roads and better infrastructure to support new homes, and delivering reliable sources of gas, power, and clean water.
