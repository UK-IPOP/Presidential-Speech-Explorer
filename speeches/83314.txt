The United States condemns in the strongest possible terms the vicious acts of terrorism committed today in Beersheva, Israel that killed and injured scores of civilians. It was a despicable act of murder, and we offer our condolences to the government and people of Israel, and especially to the families of the victims. Secretary of State Powell earlier today called Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom to express America's condolences and our condemnation of these attacks. There can be no excuse or justification for acts of terror against innocent civilians. It is critical that all who genuinely seek peace in the Middle East join in the effort to fight terrorism and dismantle all terrorist organizations.
