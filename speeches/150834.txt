Today, South Korea-based solar manufacturer Hanwha Q CELLS announced the largest single investment in solar manufacturing in U.S. history – showcasing how President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act is delivering good jobs for the people of Georgia and across the country.
Q CELLS's investment of more than $2.5 billion to expand their Dalton, Georgia plant and to build a new plant northwest of Atlanta will create 2,500 jobs in Georgia.
This investment is a direct result of President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, and just the latest in a series of major investments in American manufacturing thanks to the President's economic plan. These investments are a win for workers, consumers, and our climate.
