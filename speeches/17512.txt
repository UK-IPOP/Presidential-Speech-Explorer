I WAS GRIEVED to learn of the tragic assassination of President Jose Antonio Remon of Panama. A firm friend, President Remon was held in great respect by the government of our nation. Only last year he and Senora Remon were visitors at the White House.
To Senora Remon, to the new President Guizado and his associates in the Panamanian Government, and to the people of Panama, I extend my personal sympathies as well as the sincere condolences of the people of the United States.
