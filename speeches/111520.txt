"Four years ago in Orlando, Candidate Obama claimed he had a plan to help the middle class. But, after years of disappointing progress, it's clear middle-class families aren't better off under President Obama: wages are lower, household costs are higher, and the next generation will be forced to pay off a skyrocketing national debt. As president, Mitt Romney will deliver a new direction and new pro-growth policies that get all Americans back to work." â€” Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 OBAMA: "That's the truth at the heart of your Opportunity Compact - that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street and a struggling Main Street. That when wages are flat, prices are rising, and more and more Americans are mired in debt, our economy as a whole suffers. Our competitiveness as a nation suffers. Our children's future suffers." (Senator Barack Obama, 
, Orlando, FL, 8/2/08)
 "Yet real median household income in March was down $4,300 since Obama took office in January 2009 and down $2,900 since the June 2009 start of the economic recovery, according to an analysis of census data by Sentier Research, an economic- consulting firm in Annapolis, Maryland."

 "Unemployment ebbs and flows, but one measure of the nation's economic health, average weekly wages, rarely dips. Until now. In the latest demonstration of the struggling economy that threatens President Obama's reelection, average weekly wages fell in 2011, one of only five declines since the category was created in 1978 by the Bureau of Labor Statistics."
