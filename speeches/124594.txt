 "Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey also had a strong night, particularly at the beginning, when he swung aggressively at Mr. Rubio."
: "Chris Christie is cruising...he was on top of his roughneck game Thursday night. He was a battering ram on defense policy - the most effective of the field in making the case for a more forceful projection of military power."
: "Chris Christie B: Through force of personality, made almost every chance at the mic a moment of strength. Continued his practice of addressing the audience at home, rather than the moderators. Selling leadership, leadership, leadershipâ€”and selling it well."
: "They don't want the fighting back and forth between each other and they felt that Chris Christie has the best capability of prosecuting Hillary Clinton in the debate. So watch him. He's gaining, he's a lot of people's second choice now and he's the one that has the greatest potential going forward."
: "Winners: Chris Christie - Christie delivered the strongest debate performance of the establishment candidates as he touted his record as a governor and let his no-nonsense New Jersey spirit shine. A one-liner against Rubio is sure to get some play...It's notable that Christie's best moments came as he battled Rubio, as the two have been sparring for support in New Hampshire where Christie is on the rise."
: "WINNERS: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie - Christie has shone in almost all of the debates, his pugnacity helping him to come back from near-death, politically-speaking. He has been on the rise in New Hampshire polls.
: "I would add one name to that mix, Chris Christie who I thought had a very good night tonight."
: "Christie was witty and direct."
: "Chris Christie did well, he came out swinging and performed well. That could help him in New Hampshire."
 "I think overall Christie won on national security because he just comes off in the debates when he's been on the main stage, he just comes off as probably as the most presidential."
: "Governor Christie is capitalizing on the executive experience and it seems like a lot of folks don't want a contender to be coming from inside Washington."
: "New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie delivered one of the most popular one-liners during the Republican debate Thursday night when he happily said his party would replace President Obama next year."
: "There is another moment, also. Megyn you talk about passion, you have to talk about Governor Christie and he hit this group perfectly when talking about his frustration with Barack Obama."
 "It was Chris Christie who came out on top for the most discussed moment for this comment taking on the President, saying Mr. President, we're not against you, we're just against your policies."
 "Winners and losers - Chris Christie also may see a small bump in the polls after tonight, as he landed his lines deriding his politician class colleagues and used his moments effectively."
 "Very strong Christie answer on crime and Obama' s support for the criminal over the police. It may be Christie's best answer of the night"
 "Chris Christie Barges Into Entitlements Question"
: "Christie set himself apart by talking entitlements."
: "#Christie with a strong answer on #crime and "Sanctuary Cities". One of his better moments tonight."
: "Twitter consensus: Trump, Cruz, Christie top points. Rubio, Cruz took sparring titles for nite."
: "Let's be honest: tonight merely confirmed it's a 4 person race between Trump, Cruz, Rubio and Christie."
: "Rubio, Cruz, Trump, Christie felt like they were the only real participants. This campaign is in the war phase, lots to process before IA."
: "Order of dominance tonight: 1. Trump, 2. Cruz, 3. Christie, 4. Rubio, 5. Jeb, 6. Kasich, 7. Carson"
: "Finish line. 1. Rubio. 2. Cruz. 3.Christie..."
