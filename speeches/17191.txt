To the Congress of the United States:
I transmit herewith the second semi-annual report of the President on the activities carried on under Public Law 480, 83rd Congress, as required by that law.

This report contains the details of the programs carried out under the Act through June 30, 1955, including the volume and dollar value of commodities agreed on as well as of those already shipped, together with the planned uses of the foreign currencies generated by sales.
With experience under the Act now running to some ten months, a study is being initiated to analyze the whole problem of disposal of our agricultural surpluses. It will be the intent of this study to try to appraise objectively what the potentialities are for disposals of such surpluses within the framework of the legislative and executive policies that are applicable to legislation such as Public Law 480.
