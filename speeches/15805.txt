Dear Mr.__________ :
I recommend the enactment of legislation which would permit the posthumous appointment of the late Lieutenant General Walton H. Walker to the grade of General in the Army of the United States. I believe that General Walker's outstanding accomplishments as Commanding General of the Eighth United States Army in Korea fully entitle him to this recognition. There he proved himself to be a brilliant military commander and his indomitable courage was an inspiration to all the troops under his command.
Attached is a draft of a joint resolution which would authorize this appointment. I hope that it may receive prompt consideration by the Congress.

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
