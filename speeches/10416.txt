I WILL BE OBLIGED if you will express my cordial greetings to those gathered this evening at the fourth annual dinner of the Hundred Year Club of New York. The nature of your organization of itself demonstrates that American business survives all ebbs and flows of economic tides, and moves forward by virtue of the indomitable courage and energy and individual initiative of Americans. Likewise the earned tribute you will pay to Mr. Harvey D. Gibson illustrates the power of local community effort, when inspired by a sense of personal and civic responsibility, to meet all demands for humane helpfulness in times of stress.

[Charles C. Paulding, President, The Hundred Year Club of New York, 453 Fifth Avenue, New York City]
