OUR COUNTRY is saddened by the passing of a majestic lady. Queen Elisabeth of Belgium became to her people--and indeed to the world--a stirring symbol of dignity and courage when we most needed a demonstration of those qualities.

On behalf of the people of this country, Mrs. Johnson and I extend our deepest sympathy to King Baudouin and the people of Belgium.
