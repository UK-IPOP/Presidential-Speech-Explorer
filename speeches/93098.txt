 Today, Romney for President announced his Colorado Statewide Leadership Team. The Leadership Team will work to organize the campaign's grassroots efforts in Colorado and will help communicate Governor Romney's message of conservative change in Washington.
Making today's announcement, Romney for President State Director Katie Witt said, "Governor Mitt Romney is the best candidate to take Washington apart and put it back together so that it works better for the American people. Throughout his career in both the public and private sectors, he has proven that he is a strong leader who can solve the toughest problems. That's what we need in Washington right now. We have put together a very strong team in Colorado for Governor Romney and we look forward to helping him win Colorado's presidential primary in February and then we will help him win the White House in 2008. I speak for the entire Colorado campaign when I say we are proud to be on his team."
