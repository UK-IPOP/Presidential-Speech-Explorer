Pool Reports by 
, 
Good morning from sunny Wilmington. We have a lunch lid until 2:45 p.m.
?Pool is in the holding area near Biden's residence, being swept before the trip to the airport. We do not have a departure time.
?The motorcade left POTUS' neighborhood at about 5:30 p.m. We are rolling to the airport.
The motorcade arrived at the breezy New Castle Air National Guard Base at about 5:42 p.m.
Because of the way Marine 1 was positioned due to the wind, it was hard to see POTUS getting on but am told grandchildren Natalie and Hunter were with him.
Marine 2 lifted off at about 5:50 p.m.
Handing off to in town pool.
The second reference to the helicopter in the last pool report should have said Marine 1 and NOT Marine 2. (Apologies for any confusion caused by your pooler who was used to covering the VP.)
