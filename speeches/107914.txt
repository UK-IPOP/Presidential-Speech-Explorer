Mitt Romney today announced endorsements from two dozen members of the New York Assembly.
"President Obama has failed to create jobs or get spending under control," said Mitt Romney. "Unless we change course, America might lose its place as the dominant power in the world. With the help of these leaders in New York, I will work to ensure that businesses can start hiring again, government stops growing, and our future is as bright as our past."
Announcing the support of the New York Assembly members, Minority Leader Brian Kolb said, "Mitt Romney is the one candidate with the values and experience that will be needed to go up against President Obama in November. Throughout his life, Mitt Romney has displayed leadership in tough situations â€” that is exactly what will be needed to turn around our economy."
