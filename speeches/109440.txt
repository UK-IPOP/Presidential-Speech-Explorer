President Obama has noted that "small businesses are the backbone of our economy and the cornerstones of our Nation's promise." The same is true throughout the Western Hemisphere, where the small business sector plays a critical role in job creation and broad-based economic growth.

Announced today in Tampa, the Small Business Network of the Americas (SBNA) will promote and support job creation in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and encourage greater trade among these businesses throughout the Western Hemisphere. The SBNA will expand the pool of available resources for business development, enhance access to business counseling services for entrepreneurs, and foster SME growth by providing a framework to connect businesses across the hemisphere.
