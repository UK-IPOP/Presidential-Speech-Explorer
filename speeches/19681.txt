Governor Orval E. Faubus

Governor of the State of Arkansas

Little Rock, Arkansas
I have your telegram in which you request a meeting with me. Would it suit your convenience to come to my office on the Naval Base at Newport either Friday afternoon, September thirteenth, at three o'clock or Saturday morning, the fourteenth at nine o'clock. If you would let my office know your method of transportation to the Newport area, my staff will arrange to have you met and brought to the Base.
