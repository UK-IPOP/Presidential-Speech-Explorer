AMBASSADOR BUNKER arrived here a little before 8 o'clock from South Vietnam. He flew from Tokyo nonstop. We had breakfast together, those of us here at the table. Ambassador Bunker has given us a rather complete review of the developments in South Vietnam since his last personal visit here, with emphasis on the period since the Tet offensive.
We will be meeting here throughout the day and will be joined for a 1 o'clock lunch by Ambassador Harriman and Secretary Bundy.
Later today or tomorrow, either here or in Washington, I will meet with Admiral Sharp, Commander in Chief of the Pacific area.
Ambassador Bunker will be returning to South Vietnam when our meetings here are concluded.
Since I saw you yesterday in the Cabinet Room, we have consulted with our allies about the message that I referred to yesterday and alternative sites. We are back in touch with Hanoi and discussing a number of alternative locations which could be convenient to both sides. We are in agreement with our allies and are prepared for ambassadorial contacts just as soon as arrangements can be completed.
I will ask Mr. Christian to keep in touch with you and if there are any other announcements during our stay here, he will relay them to you as well as keep you informed of any other developments.
