I REGRET to say that Commissioner Campbell's resignation has been received. He has been a distinguished public servant.
I shall appoint someone from the Intermountain States to the vacancy. At the request of Mr. Jones, of Tennessee, I shall withdraw his name, as upon reconsideration he has concluded that he does not wish to accept the appointment. It will again be made from the Southern States.
