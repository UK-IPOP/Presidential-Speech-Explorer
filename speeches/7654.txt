THE PRESIDENT said:
"I wish to take this occasion to say how gratified I am at the presence in Washington today of the visiting lawyers and judges from Great Britain and Ireland, France, and Canada. These gentlemen are amongst the most eminent members of the bench and bar of their countries, and as a group are one of the most distinguished delegations ever to visit the United States. As they come as a gesture of the friendliness and good will of the nations which they represent, I take their visit as a very high compliment to us. The American Bar represents our country as their hosts, but I know that I speak the thoughts of our people when I say that in a large sense they are wholeheartedly the guests of the entire Nation. We welcome them most cordially."
