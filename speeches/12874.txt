 certain lands within areas adjoining the Ozark National Forest, in Arkansas, have been acquired by the United States under authority of Sections 6 and 7 of the Act of March 1, 1911, ch. 186, 36 Stat. 961, as amended (U.S.C., Title 16, Secs. 515, 516); and
 it appears that it would be in the public interest to add such lands and certain adjoining public lands within the areas hereinafter designated to the said National Forest:
, President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by Section 24 of the Act of March 3, 1891, ch. 561, 26 Stat. 1095, 1103, as amended (U.S.C., Title 16, Sec. 471), the Act of June 4, 1897, 30 Stat. 1136, and Section 11 of the said Act of March 1, 1911, do proclaim that all lands of the United States within the areas shown as additions on the diagram1 hereto annexed and made a part hereof are Included in and reserved as a part of the Ozark National Forest, and that all lands within such areas which may hereafter be acquired by the United States under the said Act of March 1, 1911, as amended, shall upon acquisition of title thereto be permanently reserved and administered as a part of the said Forest.
The reservation made by this proclamation shall as to all lands which are at this date legally appropriated under the public land laws or reserved for any public purpose other than for classification under Executive Order No. 6964 of February 5, 1935, be subject to, and shall not not interfere with or defeat, legal rights under such appropriation, nor prevent the use for such public purpose of lands so reserved, so long as such appropriation is legally maintained or such reservation remains in force.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 13th day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-six and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixtieth.
