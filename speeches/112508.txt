Today, Romney for President, Romney Victory, and the Republican National Committee announced fundraising totals of over $40.1 million in April. The campaign and RNC have $61.4 million cash on hand.
"We are pleased with the strong support we have received from Americans across the country who are looking for new leadership in the White House," said Romney Victory National Finance Chairman Spencer Zwick. "Along with the hard work of the Republican National Committee, we will continue to raise the funds necessary to defeat President Obama in November."
"Voters are tired of President Obama's broken promises," said Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. "Mitt Romney has the record and plan to turn our country around â€“ that is why he is receiving such enthusiastic support from voters across the country. Along with the campaign, we will work to provide the resources so that we can defeat President Obama and change the direction of the country."
