Pool was led into the Cabinet Room at 12:08 pm ahead of POTUS' signing of the Hire American Executive Order order. POTUS is seated at the table between Vice President Mike Pence and Kevin Lynn. There are a dozen others including Rep. Tim Burchett (who he endorses during the meeting). No person seated is wearing a mask.

POTUS says he's pushing for the removal of the CEO of the Tennessee Valley Authority, Jeff Lyash.

"The board must work to ensure the CEO does not receive a lavish compensation package upon his departure too."

"But he gets $8 million a year, and I can think of about almost 100% of the people I know would take that job."

"He gets $8 million a year so that was just a succession of deep swamp things happening and it's a disgrace."

"So let this serve as a warning to any federally appointed board. If you betray American workers, then you will hear two simple words â€˜you're fired. You're fired.'"

POTUS says he wants to find out what board members earn as well. 


Pool ushered out of Cabinet meeting at 1:11pm.

Earlier from POTUS:

"As we speak we're finalizing h1 b regulation so that no American workers replaced ever again. h1b should be used for top highly paid talent to create American jobs, not as inexpensive labor programs and destroy American job

"That's why I'm formally removing the chairman of the board James Thompson and and board members Richard Howarth.

"If the TVA does not move swiftly to reverse their decision to rehire their workers. Then more board members will be removed we have the absolute right to remove board members, and the board makes that decision. I don't make the decision."

"The current CEO Jeff Lyash is ridiculously overpaid. He earns $8 million a year."

"But the new CEO must be paid no more than $500,000 a year, which is still a significant amount more than the President of the United States."POTUS added he donates his salary.

Later in the meeting:

POTUS asks Sara Blackwell where did she get the name "slow Biden" and says he's considered using the term but thought it was "too mean."

On TikTok: POTUS now says TikTok will close On Sept. 15 of Microsoft or someone else doesn't buy it. POTUS also insists a portion of the sale needs to come into the US Treasury.

POTUS now advocating for Hydroxychloroquine.

"I don't agree with Fauci" and adds he gets along

Trump tells Acosta to "hold it" when he asks why are so many ppl are dying and then adds "Fake News CNN."

"I am" POTUS says when reporter asks why he's not personally involved in the latest stimulus negotiations. "The fact that I'm not over there with crazy Nancy...." 


A lunch lid was called at1:15 until 2:30

I'll send more quotes from today's meeting 


About 20 minutes into the hire American meeting, POTUS told reporters the CEO of the TVA called to reverse courses. "...just brought this in from the TVA CEO, and he's indicated a very strong willingness to reverse course."

Attendees clapped at hearing the news.

"Now maybe he'll take a major cut in salary." POTUS added.
