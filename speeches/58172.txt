The Administration Supports enactment of H.R. 5412, as reported by the Committee on Foreign Affairs.



H.R. 5412 would increase offsetting receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA). If H.R. 5412 were enacted, final OMB scoring estimates would be published within 5 days of enactment, as required by OBRA. The cumulative effects of all enacted legislation on direct spending will be issued in monthly reports transmitted to Congress.
