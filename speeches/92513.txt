The Clinton campaign today announced its New Jersey Hispanic Leadership Council, comprised of community leaders from across the state who will mobilize grassroots support for Hillary leading up to New Jersey's February 5th primary. The committee is in formation, and more leaders from across the state will be joining the group in support for Hillary in the upcoming days.
"Senator Hillary Clinton is uniquely prepared and unquestionably ready to lead this country and inspire each of us to be our best," said Senator Menendez. "She stands out for the richness of her experience, the depth of her intelligence and the strength of her ideals. She has been an agent of change and is ready to chart a new course for America."
"I've seen firsthand Hillary Clinton's tireless efforts to help the people of New York affected by the attacks of 9/11," said Congressman Albio Sires. "It's just one example of her strength, experience and leadership that make her uniquely suited to be President."
A Pew Hispanic Center poll released last week found that among Hispanic voters, Hillary Clinton leads the primary field by 44 points. Hillary Clinton has a strong record of fighting for issues important to the Latino community, including education, health care, and economic opportunities.
