THE WHITE HOUSE announced today that Mr. Henry P. Fletcher, who had intended to retire as Chairman of the United States Tariff Commission on September 16 next, would remain at the head of the Commission until November 15 next, at the request of President Hoover. The Commission expects that practically all pending investigations and surveys (with the exception of the vegetable and possibly one or two other investigations) will have been completed by that time.
The President believes that the Commission, under Mr. Fletcher's chairmanship, has proven that it can and will make all proper and necessary adjustments in the tariff rates and that Mr. Fletcher and the members of the Commission have performed a valuable public service in putting the Commission on an efficient operating basis, where it is commanding the confidence of the public in the absolutely fair and impartial administration of its important duties.
The President appreciates the willingness of Mr. Fletcher to remain for another 2 months, thus giving the Commission the benefit of his fine abilities.
