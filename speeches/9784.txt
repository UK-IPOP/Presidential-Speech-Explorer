THE NATION will linger today in its annual tribute of reverent memory of the glorious youth who gave their lives to defend our heritage of liberty and will pay a special homage in the dedication of the completed tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Its beauty is the symbol of our national pride in their heroism; our gratitude for their supreme devotion.
HERBERT HOOVER
