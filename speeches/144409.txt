Haiti is a partner of the United States and we have continually sought to provide support for Haiti's safety, security, and development. In January 2021, the Biden-Harris Administration announced $75.5 million in bilateral development and health assistance for a wide range of issues, including democratic governance, health, education, agricultural development, and pre-election activities. The United States is working with the Government of Haiti to deliver the first 500,000 doses of Moderna COVID-19 vaccines to the people of Haitiâ€”the first major international delivery of COVID doses to Haiti, with plans to share more doses.
Since the 2010 earthquake, the United States has made available over $5.1 billion for assistance to Haiti to support life-saving post-disaster relief as well as longer-term recovery, reconstruction, and development programs.
The United States remains committed to helping the Haitian people build a better future and is doing so in the following areas:
DHS is sending experts from the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to work with their Haitian counterparts in improving aviation and critical infrastructure security, as well as to provide support securing the upcoming elections.
State is deploying an advisor to the HNP judicial police and bringing onboard an advisor to the HNP Inspector General. These advisors help the HNP improve the integrity of processing allegations of corruption, human rights abuses, and police misconduct. Their critical investigative capacity-building support will complement U.S. federal law enforcement assistance.
State is supporting training and procuring vehicles, radios, and protective equipment to build the capacity of the HNP to protect Haitians from violence.
