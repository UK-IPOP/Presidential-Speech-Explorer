I HAVE today signed S. 2424, which amends the Communications Act to make clear that a brief appearance of a candidate for public office on a bona fide news program or in the course of radio or television coverage of important news events will not require the station to provide equal time to all other persons who are candidates for the same office. This law will make possible the continued full participation of radio and television in the news coverage of political campaigns which is so essential to a well informed America.
The legislation makes reference to the continuing obligation of broadcasters to operate in the public interest and to afford reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting views on important public issues. There is no doubt in my mind that the American radio and television stations can be relied upon to carry out fairly and honestly the provisions of this Act without abuse or partiality to any individual, group, or party.
