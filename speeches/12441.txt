 there is to be held at Tampa, Florida, during the year 1939, an international exposition which has for its purpose the commemoration of the four-hundredth anniversary of the landing of Hernando De Soto in Tampa Bay, and which because of its international character will contribute to cordial relations among nations; and
 a joint resolution of Congress, approved August 26, 1937 (50 Stat. 831), reads in part as follows:
, That the President of the United States be, and he is hereby, authorized and respectfully requested by proclamation, or in such manner as he may deem proper, to invite foreign countries to an exposition to be held in Tampa, Florida, to be known as the "Pan American Exposition", in commemoration of the four-hundredth anniversary of the landing of Hernando De Soto in Tampa Bay, under the auspices and on the grounds of the Florida Fair and Gasparilla Association, Incorporated, in the year 1939, with a request that they participate therein.
 I believe the people of many nations would be pleased to unite with the people of the United States in participating in this exposition, to be known as the Pan American Exposition:
, President of the United States of America, in compliance with the aforesaid joint resolution of Congress, do invite the participation of the countries of the Americas in this Exposition.
