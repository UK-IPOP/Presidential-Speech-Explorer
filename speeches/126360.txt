Hillary has spent her career fighting to make quality, affordable health care available for every American—and after 6 years of the Affordable Care Act, we're closer than ever to making that a reality. As president, she'll build on the successes of the law—and she'll keep fighting to bring costs down and put health care within reach for everyone.
