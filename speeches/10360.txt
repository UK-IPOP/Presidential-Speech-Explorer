THE PRESIDENT has received the unanimous request from members of the Cabinet that they should be subjected to the maximum reduction of salaries possible under the economy bill. The President has, therefore, issued the necessary order by which they will be reduced 15 percent instead of the alternative which would amount to 8 1/3 percent under the furlough provisions.
