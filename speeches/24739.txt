I HAVE CALLED this Conference with one purpose in mind: to bring together the best minds and the boldest ideas to deal with the pressing health needs of this nation.

The urgency of those needs is undeniable: --Nearly 15 million people suffer from heart disease;
--Forty-eight million people, healthy today, will become victims of cancer;
--One-fifth of our children under age seventeen are afflicted with chronic ailments.
Many citizens have been left behind in our advance toward better treatment and better health--some because of inadequate health manpower; others because of obsolete or scarce treatment facilities; and others because health services are not organized efficiently enough to provide first-rate service.
I believe that a great nation can do better. I believe that this Conference can give new strength and energy to our national effort to recruit health professionals, extend health services and improve treatment.
If we are to launch a new era for medicine-an era even more dramatic than the last a decades--we must begin by setting new goals:
--To increase the life expectancy of our citizens;

--To achieve a healthier environment;
--To decrease the infant mortality rate in the United States;
--To improve our understanding and care of the mentally ill;
--To eliminate such diseases as tuberculosis, measles, whooping cough.
Ours is a great opportunity to advance ideas which will contribute not only to a healthier America, but to a better world.
We have the resources; we need only the will and the leadership.
Let us raise our sights--and unlimber our imaginations.
