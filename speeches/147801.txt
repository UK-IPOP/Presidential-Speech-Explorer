Recognizing that the path to energy security runs through clean energy, the United States and Japan intend to build on their cooperation to increase climate ambition, including through decarbonization and clean energy, and continue to lead on their respective domestic climate efforts and on accelerating international climate action. The two sides intend to reinforce bilateral cooperation in the priority areas below to achieve their 2050 net zero goals and their aligned 2030 nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement, alongside promoting a global trajectory consistent with keeping global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius within reach.
The two sides intend to further cooperate and accelerate respective action by:
The Japan-U.S. Clean Energy Partnership (JUCEP), which advances the deployment of renewable energy and decarbonization technologies in the Indo-Pacific through partnerships with the private sector, and; The Japan-U.S. Mekong Power Partnership, or JUMPP, which supports the Mekongâ€™s energy security while encouraging greater regional power trade, renewable energy integration, and power market development.
