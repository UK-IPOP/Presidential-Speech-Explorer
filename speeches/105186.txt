"This morning's state unemployment report is further proof that President Obama's economic policies have failed. I unveiled my jobs plan earlier this month in Nevada, a state that has now seen its unemployment rate rise to 13.4%. It is clear that President Obama isn't working for Nevada or the rest of the country. At next month's debate in Las Vegas, I look forward to discussing my comprehensive plan to create jobs and get our economy moving again." â€“Mitt Romney
