 Mr. President, welcome to Beijing. I also welcome your family members and other friends from the United States to the Beijing Olympic Games.
I already learned that yesterday you went to see the American athletes in Beijing and you also watched a match played by the U.S. women's basketball team.
 Right.
 You also spent some time with the beach volleyball players. [

I think this evening the match between the Chinese men's basketball team and the American men's basketball team will captivate the attention of people from all over the world.
 That's right.
 I'm very happy that you're going to watch the match.
 Yes, sir. I'm going with the Foreign Minister. [
] He's going—he told me he's going to be yelling at the top of his lungs. [

Thank you for your hospitality. It's been a wonderful experience being here. I didn't see if you were at the opening ceremonies.
 Yes, I was there.
 Well, it was fantastic— really well done. But thank you.
 Yes, the opening ceremony is spectacular.
 Unbelievable.
 When the U.S. team marched into the stadium, I saw that you put back your coat and your suit and then you stood up and cheered for your team.
 Yes, sir. I was proud to see them. But I bet you did the same thing when the Chinese team came. [
]
 Yes, yes. I did the same.
