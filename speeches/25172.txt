THE BOARD appointed by me has rendered a decision which I regard as wise, sound, and prudent, and nearly all of the major ports will reopen at 8 o'clock in the morning.
The recommendations have my full backing. To the extent that this procedure has resulted in reopening ports, it is a job well and superbly done and the Board is dissolved with my deep thanks.
The management representatives have accepted the recommendations of the panel. A problem remains in carrying out the recommendations with ILA locals in the West Gulf and Southern Atlantic ports. The Secretary of Labor will discuss with the union representatives a procedure to effectuate the wise conclusions of the panel and will report to me promptly.
