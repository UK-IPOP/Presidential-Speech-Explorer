 Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced his Michigan Women for Mitt Coalition Steering Committee. These 104 women from across the state will talk to voters about Michigan native Governor Romney, and his optimistic vision to strengthen the economy, strengthen our national defense, and build stronger American families.
"These dedicated Republican women have worked tirelessly to promote conservative principles in their communities," said Governor Romney. "Their work will be critical in the months leading up to the primary next year as I work to make sure Michigan voters know I take the problems facing their state personally. As President, I will make sure families in Michigan and across the nation benefit from lower taxes, good paying jobs, and that our children are prepared to compete in the world economy."
