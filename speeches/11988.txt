 the hereinafter-described public lands in the State of Oregon have been found to be chiefly valuable for national-forest purposes; and
 such lands are within the limitations contained in the act of March 4, 1925, entitled "An Act To authorize the addition of certain lands to the Whitman National Forest", c. 541, 43 Stat. 1282; and
 it appears that the addition of such lands to the Whitman National Forest would be in the public interest:
 President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the power vested in me by the aforesaid act of March 4, 1925, do proclaim that, subject to all valid existing claims, the following-described public lands in the State of Oregon are hereby added to, and reserved as a part of, the Whitman National Forest:

T. 11 S., B. 40 E., sec. 31, lots 3 and 4; aggregating 626.25 acres.
Executive Orders No. 4220 of May 8, 1925, and No. 6910 of November 26, 1934, as amended, withdrawing public lands for classification, are hereby revoked so far as they affect any of the above-described lands.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington, this 26" day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-third.
