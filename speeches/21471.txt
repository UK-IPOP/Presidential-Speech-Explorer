Senator John F. Kennedy, Democratic Presidential nominee, sent the following message to the Archibishop Iakovos, on the occasion of the 15th Biennial Clergy Laity Conference of the Greek Orthodox Church of North and South America, at the Statler Hilton in Buffalo, N.Y., opening September 17, 1960:

  Your Excellency, please give my warmest greetings to the 15th Biennial Clergy Laity Conference of the Greek Orthodox Church of North and South America and my best wishes for success in your deliberations. The Democratic Party has always admired and respected the outstanding contributions which Americans of Hellenic descent have made to our democratic institutions and our American way of life. They have contributed another chapter to the illustrious heritage of their forefathers by their steadfast devotion to the principles of liberty and freedom which have made our country so great. Of particular interest to those attending the conference, I know, is the pledge made by the Democratic Party, which I wholeheartedly support, to remove the distinction between native-born and naturalized citizens and to assure full protection of our laws to all. This pledge must be given a high priority by the new Democratic administration for there is no place for second-class citizenship in America.
When the universal values of human dignity, truth, and justice under law have been guaranteed to all men - we will have created an enduring peace for ourselves, our children, and the priceless institutions of our way of life.
Senator JOHN F. KENNEDY
