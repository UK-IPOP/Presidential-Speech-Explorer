The Executive Order signed by the President on August 5, 1935, requesting seven agencies, with operations which do not come under the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, to submit to the Director of the Bureau of the Budget estimates covering future expenditures for administrative purposes, has been amended to make its provisions applicable to six additional agencies. These agencies are the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Surplus Relief Administration, the Export-Import Bank of Washington, the Second Export-Import Bank of Washington, D.C., the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and the Electric Home and Farm Authority.
The provisions of the Executive Order of August 5, 1935, that the agencies named therein are not to incur, from and after September 15, 1935, any obligations for administrative expenses not approved by the Director of the Bureau of the Budget are made applicable to the agencies covered by the amended order from and after October 1, 1935.
