Throughout the weekend, members of the Clinton campaign's Veterans and Military Retirees Steering Committee represented Hillary at events around the country. From Arkansas to Washington, committee members honored their fellow veterans by participating in Veterans Day parades, ceremonies and other grass-roots activities. In addition, the campaign continued announcing prominent veterans as members of the National Veterans and Military Retirees Steering Committee. Yesterday, the campaign announced 36 new national co-chairs to its steering committee and unveiled a new video featuring a cross-generation of veterans discussing their support of Hillary Clinton for President. There are more that 1,200 veterans and military retirees who have joined Hillary Clinton's national and state veterans' steering committees.
"I am honored to have the support of our men and women who have served our nation with distinction," said Clinton. "Our veterans have been on the frontlines of defending our democracy, and as President, I will fulfill our commitment to them."
