My dear Mr. Platt:
I have received your letter of resignation in confirmation of information previously conveyed to me.
In accepting it I should like to express the appreciation I hold, and I know the whole business community holds, for the service you have so long performed as a member of the Federal Reserve Board and in other public activities. The Board has rendered great public service, to which you have contributed in large measure.
I trust you will find success in your new occupation and with kind regards, I am

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Hon. Edmund Platt, Federal Reserve Board, Washington, D.C.]
