I HAVE just been informed of the tragic death of Ambassador John E. Peurifoy and his son. A brilliant career diplomat, Ambassador Peurifoy served his country exceptionally well for many years. The United States and the free world has lost an outstanding champion of freedom and peace.
On the personal side, Mrs. Eisenhower and I have lost a valued friend. We extend our deepest sympathy to Mrs. Peurifoy in the great loss she has sustained.
