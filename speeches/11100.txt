IT WAS A great shock to both Mrs. Hoover and me to learn this morning of the passing of your mother. She has been so true and loyal a friend and has contributed so much to national welfare in a thousand directions that her death becomes both a personal and a national loss. We wish you and Mrs. Reid to know that you have our deepest sympathy.
HERBERT HOOVER
