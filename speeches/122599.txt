Today, I will take another stand against the disastrous "Waters of the US" mandate from the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers. The rule will embolden Washington regulators by giving bureaucrats the authority to regulate private bodies of water like small streams and ponds.

This would be especially harmful for 
, who could lose control over their land and be forced to comply with expensive permitting requirements. For example, the Iowa Farm Bureau estimates that 97% of Iowa could be covered by the rule.

I am opposed to this power grab, plain and simple, and I want to thank my friend Joni Ernst for leading the fight against it. A federal court recently blocked the rule temporarily, but I believe WOTUS should be stopped for good. That's why I've proposed 
 to limit the costs that regulators can impose on the economy.

We must pursue policies that reduce government burdens on 
, not increase them. Stopping WOTUS is a good first step.
