Your Imperial Majesty:
Your Imperial Majesty's message of sympathy concerning the tragic loss of life and property which a hurricane recently inflicted on the northeastern coast of the United States has touched me deeply. It is further evidence of your humanitarian feelings which are so widely recognized. I appreciate your message and the spirit which inspired it, and I wish to take this occasion to assure you again of my admiration for the way you have led your nation through the difficulties of the past few years to the present point where a future full of opportunity is opening before you and your people.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
