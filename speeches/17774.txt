His Excellency

Adolfo Ruiz Cortines

President of the United Mexican States
I join with the people of the United States of America in expressing to Your Excellency and the people of Mexico profound sympathy in the tragic disaster wrought by flood waters along the Rio Grande which has brought untold suffering to many persons in both countries. Our thoughts and prayers go out to those bereaved and left homeless.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
