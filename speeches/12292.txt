 by act of Congress approved May 23, 1908, 35 Stat. 268, certain lands in the State of Minnesota were set apart and reserved as the Minnesota National Forest, the name of which was by Executive Order No. 4913 of June 22, 1928, changed to Chippewa National Forest; and
 it appears that it would be in the public interest to modify the boundaries of the said national forest by including therein certain forest lands which have been, or may be, acquired by the United States of America under authority of the act of Congress approved March 1, 1911, ch. 186, 36 Stat. 961 (U.S.C., title 16, sec. 516), as amended by the act of June 7, 1924, ch. 348, 43 Stat. 653 (U.S.C., title 16, sec. 515), and certain adjoining public lands:
, President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the power in me vested by section 24 of the act of March 3, 1891, ch. 561, 26 Stat. 1095, 1103, as amended (U.S.C., title 16, sec. 471), the act of June 4, 1897, ch. 2, 30 Stat. 34, 36 (U.S.C., title 16, sec. 473), and section 11 of the said act of March 1, 1911, do proclaim that all lands of the United States within the area shown as an addition on the diagram attached hereto and made a part hereof are hereby included in and reserved as a part of the Chippewa National Forest, and that all lands within such area which may hereafter be acquired by the United States under the said acts of March 1, 1911, and June 7, 1924, shall upon acquisition of title thereto be reserved and administered as part of the said Forest.
The reservation made by this proclamation shall be subject to valid existing rights, and shall as to all lands which are at this date reserved for any public purpose other than for classification under Executive Order No. 6964 of February 5, 1935, as amended, be subject to such reservation and shall not prevent the use for such public purpose of lands so reserved so long as such reservation remains in force.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.Â 
 at the City of Washington, this 29th day of December in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-six and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-first.
