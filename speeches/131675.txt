 But on the whole, I think I have so many things to say about—[
]. I will just summarize—[
].

We are your ally. We are an important ally. [
]

And I will request everybody to—after you've taken the shots, with the best angles that you would like—kindly go out.

I cannot discuss the things that they want to say. You may want to make an—just a statement so that the media are going to have something to go back home.

 Yes, I would. And I will say this: You—the media was a little bit late, and you actually missed the best part of the President's statement. [
] I think he should make it again, but it was good. [
]

But we've had a great relationship. This has been very successful. We have many meetings today with many other leaders. The ASEAN conference has been handled beautifully by the President and the Philippines and your representatives. And I've really enjoyed being here. The weather is always good. Today it's pretty good. But one thing about the Philippines, eventually, it gets good, no matter what.

But we very much appreciate the great treatment you've given. I thought last year—last night's event was fantastic—tremendous talent, most of it, I guess, from the Philippines. But tremendous talent—musical talent, dance talent. And we really had a tremendous time, all of the leaders.

So I just—I think on behalf of everybody, I want to thank you and I want to thank the Philippines.

Thank you very much.

 You're welcome, I'm sure, Mr. President.

Mr. President—[
].

 We're not answering any—this is not the press statement. We are in a bilateral meeting. Maybe the press conference would follow.

 Thank you very much, everyone.

 We will be talking on matters of interest to both the Philippines and—with you around, guys, you're the spies. Yes, you are. [
