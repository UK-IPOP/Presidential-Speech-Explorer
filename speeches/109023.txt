The Romney plan moves in incremental steps; the Gingrich plan advances a bold new vision of limited government that frees American businesses to produce, export and create jobs.

The Newt Gingrich record on jobs and prosperity is clear: During his Speakership, Americans created over 11 million new jobs. Entrepreneurs invested historic amounts of venture capital following the biggest capital gains tax cut history. Manufacturing grew steadily, with nearly 17.5 million Americans working in the sector by the time he left office in 1999.
As president, Gingrich will adopt the same proven job creating policies he employed as Speaker, as well as those implemented by Ronald Reagan, to restore economic growth and job creation in America: a bold series of tax cuts and regulatory reforms, unleashing American energy, and returning power to the states.

Under Mitt Romney's management, jobs in Massachusetts grew by barely 1%, companies regularly departed for more business-friendly states and nearly 40,000 of the Bay State's manufacturing jobs evaporated.
