My dear Mr. Roosevelt:
With reluctance I have concluded to accept your resignation as Vice Governor of the Philippine Islands. I chose you for that post because you would be especially well qualified for it through your knowledge of Philippine conditions and your deep interest in the Filipino people; and I appreciate fully the unselfish spirit that has prompted your withdrawal.
I have determined to appoint you as the United States Minister to Hungary--so that in that other field where you have already worked, the United States may have your service.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Hon. Nicholas Roosevelt, Vice Governor of the Philippine Islands, War Department, Washington, D.C.]
