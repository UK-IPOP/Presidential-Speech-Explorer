Lincoln, Neb.. Nov. 5.
Gov. Woodrow Wilson, Princeton, N. J.
Having finished a seven weeks' tour of twenty-two States with a meeting here similar to yours, I beg to assure you that indications everywhere point to an overwhelming victory. But, whether you win or lose, I congratulate you on the splendid campaign you have made. You deserve to succeed. With best wishes.
W.J. BRYAN.
