 "Barrett exhibited grace under fire during her contentious confirmation hearing, and she received robust bipartisan support from the legal community, including from Neal Katyal, a prominent liberal who served as President Barack Obama's acting solicitor general." (Elizabeth Slattery and John Malcolm, "Meet The 6 Stellar Judges Leading The Pack On Trump's Supreme Court Short List," 
, 6/3/18)

 "'She is an extraordinary woman, an extraordinary legal mind -- first-class, penetrating,' said Silberman, who went on to help Barrett get a Supreme Court clerkship with Antonin Scalia. The iconic conservative justice became one of Barrett's most important mentors." (David Yaffe-Bellany and Lydia Wheeler, "In Trump Court Front-Runner, Religious Right Sees One OF Its Own,"

"We are writing to express our strong support for the nomination of Professor Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. We are a diverse group of law professors who represent a broad range of fields and perspectives. We share the belief, however, that Professor Barrett is exceptionally well qualified to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals, and we urge the Senate to confirm her as a judge of that court." (Law Professors, 
, 5/19/17)

"She is eminently qualified for the job. This view is unanimous â€“ every law clerk* from October Term 1998 has joined this letter." (October Term 1998 Law Clerks, 
, 5/26/17)



 "Indeed, it is a testament to Amy's fitness for this office that every full-time member of our faculty has signed this letter." (Notre Dame Law School Faculty, 
 5/11/17)

 "We are graduates of Notre Dame Law School and former students of Professor Amy Coney Barrett, whom President Trump recently nominated for a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. We write to urge the United States Senate to confirm Professor Barrett." (Former Students,

 "Aymond also called Barrett a 'woman of integrity' for defending both her faith and professionalism." (Bryn Stole, "Amy Coney Barrett: Mother Of 7, Metairie Native, Solid Conservative ... Next Supreme Court Justice?,"

 "The Indiana resident is the mother of seven children, including two from Haiti and one with special needs." (Richard Wolf, "Who Might Succeed Justice Ginsburg? Trump's Short List Begins With These Five Women (And One Man)," 
, 9/18/20)

 "Last October, less than an hour before the U.S. Senate voted to confirm Barrett as a new Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals judge, she was trick-or-treating with her kids, said another friend and fellow law professor Jennifer Mason McAward." (Caleb Bauer and Margaret Fosmoe, "Notre Dame's Amy Coney Barrett Noted For Mentoring, Family Focus. Next Up: Supreme Court?," 
 7/8/18)

 "Outside of the university, friends and colleagues say, is the story of a dedicated working mom. One close friend, Wendy Angst, says Barrett, the mother of seven children, gets up between 4 and 5 a.m., exercises, and later gives her son, Ben, a piggyback ride down the stairs. She routinely ferries her children to and from the pool and has dinner with her family. Angst said Barrett's husband, Jesse, takes time out of each day working as an assistant U.S. Attorney in the Northern District of Indiana to pick their children up from school." (Caleb Bauer and Margaret Fosmoe, "Notre Dame's Amy Coney Barrett Noted For Mentoring, Family Focus. Next Up: Supreme Court?,"

 "Since then, she's served as a board member at South Bend's Trinity School at Greenlawn, held a position on the St. Joseph Catholic Church Parish Pastoral Council and raised seven children with her husband Jesse, including two adopted from Haiti."

 "But Barrett's popularity with students sometimes made things tough for Nagle. 'I think the most vivid memory I have is how difficult it was to get into Amy's office to see her because the line of students would be quite long,' Nagle said with a laugh. 'Sometimes it was students with questions about course material, but oftentimes it was students seeking her advice and her mentoring.'"

 "Barrett, if nominated and confirmed, would be only the fifth woman to serve on the Supreme Court. She'd join Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor on the bench. Harriet Miers' 2005 nomination was the last time a Republican president picked a woman for a seat on the court." (Evan Semones, "What You Need To Know About Amy Coney Barrett, 
 9/19/20)

 "At 48-years-old, Barrett would be the youngest justice currently on the Supreme Court, making it entirely plausible that Barrett could leave her mark on a swath of cases for a generation or more." (Evan Semones, "What You Need To Know About Amy Coney Barrett, 
 9/19/20)

 "If Amy Coney Barrett, 46 and a 1990 graduate of St. Mary's Dominican High School in New Orleans, is ultimately nominated and confirmed, she would be the first justice from Louisiana since Edward Douglass White Jr. served on a court that more than a century ago remade business law and entrenched racial segregation for generations . . . White, Louisiana's only U.S. Supreme Court justice, served on the court from 1894 until his death in 1921." (Bryn Stole, "Amy Coney Barrett: Mother Of 7, Metairie Native, Solid Conservative ...
