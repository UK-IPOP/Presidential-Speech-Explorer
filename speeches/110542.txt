"Three years ago, President Obama promised to get spending under control and cut the deficit in half by the end of his first term. That is a promise he has not kept. This will be America's fourth consecutive year of running a trillion-dollar deficit. On top of that, the President has proposed a massive tax increase and offered no serious reforms to our entitlement programs. President Obama has not been up to the job of getting our fiscal house in order." —Mitt Romney
 OBAMA: "[T]oday I'm pledging to cut the deficit we inherited in half by the end of my first term in office. This will not be easy. It will require us to make difficult decisions and face challenges we've long neglected. But I refuse to leave our children with a debt that they cannot repay — and that means taking responsibility right now, in this administration, for getting our spending under control."

 "The plan calls for a tax reform package that would increase revenue by $1.5 trillion over the next decade. Obama did not offer a detailed plan for tax reform. Instead, he proposed a series of changes to the current tax system and several principles for what comprehensive tax reform would look like." ("Obama Budget Sets Stage For Battle Over Tax Hikes,"

 "'The president's budget fails to lay out a substantive path to restore fiscal sanity,' said David M. Walker, former director of the Government Accountability Office.

It is not bold enough or specific enough regarding proposed changes to Medicare, Medicaid and other health reforms.'"
