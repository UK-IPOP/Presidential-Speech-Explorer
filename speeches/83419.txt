America's economy is strong and getting stronger. The President's economic policies are creating jobs and driving steady economic growth, but there is still more work to be done. The U.S. economy is changing, and President Bush understands that many Americans are working hard to make ends meet. That is why the President continues to push for pro-growth policies that will strengthen our economy, help create more jobs, lower health care costs, and raise Americans' standard of living. Many of the new jobs being created require new skills. The President is committed to helping American workers acquire the skills they need to access the jobs of the 21st century.
