Mitt Romney today announced his Kentucky State Finance Chairs, Joe Craft and Kelly Knight.
"I am proud to announce my Kentucky State Finance Chairs," said Mitt Romney. "Kelly and Joe's help will be essential in securing the resources necessary to defeat President Obama in 2012. Kentucky has been hit hard by President Obama's failed economic leadership. Voters there and across the country are looking for a president who will not only bring back jobs and restore economic growth but also get serious about energy independence and take advantage of our country's coal resources, which is especially important in Kentucky. Kelly and Joe's support will be essential to spreading my message to turn around our struggling economy."
