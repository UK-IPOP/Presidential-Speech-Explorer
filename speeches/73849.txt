 Mr. President, are you more optimistic today about the prospects for a Middle East peace settlement?
 All I can tell you is that they're still talking, and consistent with our rules, I'm still not talking. [
] But I'm hopeful.
 Mr. President, are the two of you going to be talking about missile defense here today?
 I'm sure we will. We talked about it last month in Moscow, and I'm sure we'll talk about it.
