[Released August 6, 1955. Dated August 1, 1955]
Dear Mr. Chancellor:
I was most happy to receive your letter of July twenty-fifth, expressing satisfaction with the results of the recent Geneva Conference. I particularly appreciate what you said about my contribution to those results. At the same time, I am fully aware that progress at Geneva would not have been possible without that unity of peaceful purpose among the Western Allies which you, Mr. Chancellor, have done so much to establish.
We must now look forward to a period of arduous and continuing negotiation in the effort to achieve the aims of peace and justice for all men in an atmosphere which will permit the growth of freedom. As you know, I consider that the reunification of your country is of first importance in the process of establishing foundations for a lasting peace. I agree fully with your view that the maintenance of Western unity is vital to the ultimate achievement of these objectives and welcome your assurances of cooperation toward this end on the part of the German Federal Government.

With assurances of my high esteem and personal regard,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
