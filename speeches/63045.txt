The Administration supports several key features of S. 143, including: substantial program consolidation and simplification; establishing a one-stop career center delivery system for adult training; providing a clear role for State and local education agencies in the administration of workforce education programs; and targeting workforce education funds to areas with the greatest need. It also ensures strong connections between the workforce development system and the vocational rehabilitation system. The Administration is also pleased that S. 143 provides support for States and local communities to continue the implementation of their School-to-Work Opportunities Act plans.
