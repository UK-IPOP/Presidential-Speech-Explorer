Good afternoon on a truly fantastic Monday at the White House.
Pool is gathering for the swearing in ceremony for Ambassador to Jamaica, Nick Perry. The event is taking place in Vice President Kamala Harris' office, and pool will send relevant details as they arise. Feel free to ping me with any questions.
Pool preset in Harris’ ceremonial office at 3:20pm. VP and Perry will be standing on the North side of the room facing the conference table… will send a photo of the scene in a future report
The event was originally scheduled to start at 3:20, but we’re in a holding pattern until VP returns from POTUS’ bill signing ceremony
Perry’s family entered VP’s office at 3:32pm. Pool will send full attendees list once WH provides.
VP and the ambassador entered through the North door at 3:41pm and the ceremony began immediately.
More to follow…
The event concluded at 3:46pm.
Sen. Leader Chuck Schumer and a number of other lawmakers were in attendance. The group took several photos with Perry's extended family
VP did not answer a number of abortion related questions from pool. Leader Schumer told reporters he did not want to talk "today" about Wednesday's vote on legislation codifying Roe v. Wade.
One more report coming with photos
That’s all from me folks. Have a great Monday
