Thank you very much, Mr. Ewing. Mr. Ambassador, and visiting teachers:
It is a pleasure to me to welcome you here, and I hope that you will enjoy your stay in this country-
As I have said before to similar meetings, I think this is the way for us to find out exactly what our people are, and how they think, and how they act; and when you find that out you will find that there isn't a great deal of difference between us, you will find that when the associations such as this take place, that there isn't much difference between us at home and abroad.
That is a contribution to peace in the world, to the welfare of all the people in the world. And I am hopeful that when you go back to your home countries, and when our people come back from your countries, that there will be a better understanding, and that we will have made a great contribution to the peace of the world--an honest peace, not a propaganda peace. A peace that is real--a peace that will give us security in the future.
I thank you very much for coming here, and I hope you will enjoy it.
