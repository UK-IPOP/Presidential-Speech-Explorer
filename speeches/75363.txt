 Are we in the middle of an economic downturn?
 We'll let the numbers speak for themselves. I'm concerned about our economy. I'm confident, however, if we do the right things, we can have economic growth, the likes of which we've had in the past. We'll watch the numbers carefully. The numbers will speak the truth.
The last quarter of last year was a very slow growth quarter, and we'll see how it is in the first quarter of this year. I think a lot of experts believe that it's going to be slow.

 Mr. President, are you going to intervene in the Comair strike?
 The National Mediation Board did not make—did not rule. In other words, they did not give me the right to move in on the strike. Therefore, the parties are going to have to settle it themselves.
 Are you still determined to prevent a season of airline strikes, sir?
 I am worried about what the airline shutdowns could do to the economy. I would urge that all parties come to quick resolution on the matters that— you know, on the table. Yes, I'm concerned about what airline strikes could do.
 But your hands are tied in this case?
 In this case they are, as you know. Thank you.
