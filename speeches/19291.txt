THE DEATH of General of the Army George Catlett Marshall at Walter Reed General Hospital today is cause for profound grief throughout the United States.
General Marshall long ago earned a place as one of the distinguished military and civil leaders of our century, an example of devotion to service and duty, an outstanding American.
For his wartime role as Chief of Staff of the Army, and for his subsequent service as Secretary of State and as Secretary of Defense, he has been honored as soldier and statesman. His courage, fortitude and vision, his selflessness and stern standards of conduct and character were an inspiration, not only within the Army, but throughout the Nation and among our allies. For his unswerving devotion to the safeguarding of the security and freedom of our Nation, for his wise counsel and action and driving determination in times of grave danger, we are lastingly in his debt.
Today these thoughts echo in the memory of a grateful Nation which joins with Mrs. Eisenhower and me in extending condolence to Mrs. Marshall and in mourning the passing of one of the Nation's most illustrious sons.
