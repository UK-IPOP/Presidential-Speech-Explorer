I AM DELIGHTED, on behalf of the Allied Forces who, advancing from the west, did so much to crush Nazi tyranny, to accept this beautiful and ancient relic of Jewish civilization.

I am certain that those Forces--the American forces and their Allies--were representing only what we would call the heart of freedom, the belief that all people are entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness--that where these are denied one man, they are threatened for all.
And so I am sure those Forces felt that in uncovering these camps, relieving the disasters and correcting the terrible conditions under which those people were living, they were not doing it fundamentally and merely because they were Jews, or anybody else. They were unfortunate human beings, and I think the heart of America and the heart of Britain and of France and the other Western Allies responded to that kind of inspiration and were delighted to do it.
It was a tremendous privilege and a great change from the killing of war to turn your armies to saving human lives and human dignity.
I sincerely trust that all those people are now living in health and happiness, or at least under conditions that are those of self-respect and decency.
Thank you very much for this treasure, which is unique and I have nothing like it, I assure you.
