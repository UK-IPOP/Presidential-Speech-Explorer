 – Presidential candidate Ted Cruz 
 announced his "Stop Illegal Immigration" plan – the policy he will implement as President to secure the border and enforce the rule of law in order to create the environment necessary to finally fix our legal immigration system. Only when the border is secure and the rule of law enforced can reforms be meaningfully implemented to fix our legal immigration system. Cruz presented his plan at a grassroots rally of more than 1,500 in Orlando, Florida.
"We have a serious immigration problem in America," Cruz said. "The American people understand that we must reverse the policies that invite criminals and terrorists to defy the law, allow manipulation of our generous immigration system, and reward illegal immigrants for their actions.  Sadly, while the Obama Administration ignores our immigration laws and abuses its executive authority, the Washington Cartel refuses to stand up and insist that the law be followed. A strong President can and must secure the border.  Under current law, there is more than enough legal authority to do so; what is missing is the political will.  In the Senate, I have stood consistently with the majority of Americans against amnesty and lawlessness, and I will do the same as President."
