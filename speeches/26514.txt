I AM DELIGHTED that the Administrative Conference is now fully organized and will hold its first plenary session next month. It is heartening that so many eminent private citizens will contribute their time and talent to this important endeavor. Through this Conference major improvements will be achieved in the processes of Government that vitally affect our citizens every day.
