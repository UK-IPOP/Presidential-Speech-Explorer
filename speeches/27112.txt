SUMMER should be a time of joy for children. But for many city children it is a time of frustration, discomfort, and boredom. For them, the only available playground is a tenement stoop. Their only relief from the heat is obtained from an open hydrant, or on a crowded fire escape.
More fortunate Americans can give these children a chance to enjoy the blessings of summer. By participating in the "Share Your Summer" campaign, they can enrich their own lives, as well as others.
