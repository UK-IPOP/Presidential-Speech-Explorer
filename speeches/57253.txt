The Administration supports enactment of S. 1.



S. 1 could result in increased receipts to the Federal Government due to provisions in S. 1 that would impose criminal fines against individuals not complying with certain prohibitions related to the sale, purchase, or donation of human fetal tissue. Therefore, S. 1 is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate is that the pay-as-you-go effect of the bill is zero.
