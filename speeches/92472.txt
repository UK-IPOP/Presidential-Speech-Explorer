The Clinton campaign today announced its Utah Steering Committee, made up of community leaders from across the state who will mobilize grassroots support for Hillary leading up to Utah's February 5th primary.
"Hillary's spent 35 years working for change," said State Senate Minority Leader Mike Dmitrich. "She's ready to do the job from her first day in the Oval Office."
"In sending Hillary Clinton to the White House, we will not only elect the best qualified candidate, we will once and for all shatter the highest glass ceiling in America," said former Congresswoman Karen Shepherd.
"Hillary is committed to rebuilding the middle class, ending the war in Iraq and providing health care for every American, and she has the strength and experience to deliver," said Charles Henderson, former chair of the Utah African American Caucus.
"I'm honored to have such strong support from across Utah," Clinton said. "These distinguished leaders will be critical to growing our grassroots network throughout the state."
