The Administration strongly urges that H.R. 2409 be removed from the Suspension Calendar so that it can be amended to:


— delete the creation of unnecessary, expensive new institutes, such as for nursing, and

— reduce the bill's excessive authorization levels, which are $282 million or 13 percent over the House-passed budget resolution.
If H.R. 2409 were to reach the President's desk in its present form, disapproval would be recommended.
