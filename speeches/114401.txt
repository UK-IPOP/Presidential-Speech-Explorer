America has always been a nation of immigrants, and throughout the nation's history, immigrants from around the globe have kept our workforce vibrant, our businesses on the cutting edge, and helped to build the greatest economic engine in the world. However, America's immigration system is broken and has not kept pace with changing times. Today, too many employers game the system by hiring undocumented workers and there are 11 million people living and working in the shadow economy. Neither is good for the U.S. economy or California families.

Attached is a report by the National Economic Council about the economic benefits for California by fixing our broken immigration system.







•      Providing a pathway to earned citizenship and expanding high- and low-skilled visa programs will increase total personal income for California families by $29.1 billion in 2020, according to Regional Economic Models, Inc.

•      Commonsense immigration reform would have increased the state and local taxes paid by immigrants in California by approximately $327 million in 2010, according to one study.
