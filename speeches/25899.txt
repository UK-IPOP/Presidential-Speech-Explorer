I HAVE RECEIVED the report of Emergency Board No. 172. I established this Board on November 6, 1968, under the National Railway Labor Act, to investigate the dispute between the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen and the Louisville & Nashville, Chicago Belt, and Illinois Central Railroads.
Under the National Railway Labor Act, the parties are not free to strike for an additional 30 days.
During this period, I urge the Brotherhood and the railway management to use every effort to resolve their differences through the free process of collective bargaining.
