 – As Senator John Edwards' presidential campaign continues to gain support across the country, more than 30 Democratic leaders from Indiana came out in support of Edwards and his vision to transform America. Among those endorsing Edwards for president are Indiana House of Representatives Majority Leader Russ Stillwell and former Indiana Democratic Party Chairs Robin Winston and Ann DeLaney.
"As a third generation coal miner, I understand the challenges facing America's working families," said Stilwell. "Between caring for elderly parents, paying their bills and educating their children, working men and women struggle to make ends meet. John Edwards understands the choices facing Hoosier workers as they strive to provide for their families. I am proud to join other Democrats in supporting John Edwards for President because I know he will work to make the American dream a reality for all of us."
Winston endorsed Edwards saying, "John Edwards embodies the spirit of our party. He has plans to address the issues that matter to Hoosier families—plans to provide universal health care, create a new energy economy, strengthen our middle class and protect our country. Senator Edwards reminds me of the best of our Midwest values and will help move Indiana and our nation forward."
DeLaney said, "I think that John Edwards is uniquely qualified in this very dangerous time to lead our country. He shares the values of Hoosiers and understands the challenges facing the middle class. I enthusiastically endorse his candidacy."
