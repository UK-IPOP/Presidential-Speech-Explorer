[Released March 29, 1956. Dated March 28, 1956]
Dear Mr. Secretary:
It is with profound personal regret that I accept your resignation as Secretary of the Interior, effective April fifteenth.
While I am reluctant to forego your valuable assistance as a member of the Cabinet, I understand your purpose and I salute your determination to bring the facts pertaining to this Administration before your fellow citizens of Oregon.
Under your guidance and with your enthusiastic leadership, the Department of the Interior has ably met its responsibilities in carrying forward the essential programs designed to assure orderly development and wise use of our natural .resources, in accord with sound conservation principles.
Our mission has not been completed. While we have made significant progress in the past three years, much remains to be done before the aims of this Administration will have been fully met.
As a Cabinet member you have helped shape our programs for the benefit of 166 million Americans. Your counsel in these matters has been of inestimable value. Your knowledge of natural resource conservation and management, gained through long years of experience in private life and as a public official, has served the nation well during the period you have been Secretary of the Interior. I have no doubt that it will continue to be of benefit to your State and the nation in the years to come.
I am sure that there are many who share with me a sense of loss at your departure and who join me in extending every good wish as you undertake this new phase of your distinguished public career.
With warm personal regard,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
