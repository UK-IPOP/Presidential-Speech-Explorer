"The Federal Reserve's announcement of a third round of quantitative easing is further confirmation that President Obama's policies have not worked. After four years of stagnant growth, falling incomes, rising costs, and persistently high unemployment, the American economy doesn't need more artificial and ineffective measures. We should be creating wealth, not printing dollars. As president, Mitt Romney will enact bold, pro-growth policies that lead to robust job creation, higher take-home pay, and a true economic recovery." â€”Lanhee Chen, Romney for President Policy Director
 "The Federal Reserve announced plans to unleash more stimulus Thursday, in its third attempt at a controversial program to rev up the U.S. economy. The policy, known as quantitative easing and often abbreviated as QE3, entails buying $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities each month. The end date remains up in the air, as the Fed will re-evaluate the strength of the economy in coming months." (Annalyn Censky, "Federal Reserve Launches QE3,"

 "The Federal Reserve launched another aggressive stimulus program on Thursday, saying it will buy $40 billion of mortgage-related debt per month until the outlook for jobs improves substantially as long as inflation remains contained. In a significant shift in the direction of U.S. monetary policy, the Fed's policymaking committee tied its unconventional bond buying directly to economic conditions, a move that is likely to be controversial among central bank critics."

 "The statement said that the economy had continued to expand 'at a moderate pace,' but that the Fed had concluded 'growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions.' That has been true for months, perhaps years, but implicit in the statement was the Fed's conclusion that the situation was no longer acceptable."

 "Critics have warned that the Fed's continued easy-money policies are setting up the economy for runaway inflation in the future, something that Bernanke does not see happening." (Don Lee and Jim Puzzanghera, "Fed, Worried About Job Growth, Launches New Stimulus,"

 "The ranks of America's poor remained stuck at record levels, although dwindling unemployment benefits and modest job gains helped stave off what experts had predicted would be the fourth rise in a row in the poverty rate." (Hope Yen, "US Poverty Rate Unchanged; Record Numbers Persist,"

 "The gap between rich and poor Americans grew in 2011 as the poverty rate remained at almost a two-decade high. The U.S. Census Bureau released figures today that showed household income fell, underscoring a sputtering economic recovery that's at the heart of the presidential campaign." (Catherine Dodge and Frank Bass, "Rich-Poor Gap Widens To Most Since 1967 As Income Falls,"

 "By buying mortgage-linked debt, the Fed hopes to press mortgage costs lower and force investors into other assets, lowering their yields as well. Those lower borrowing costs should spur greater lending activity and foster faster economic growth, officials believe. U.S. economic growth cooled in the second quarter, coming in at a tepid 1.7 percent annual rate, and forecasters do not believe it is doing much better now."
