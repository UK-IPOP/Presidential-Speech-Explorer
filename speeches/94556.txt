Clinton Campaign Responds to New Obama Ad in Wisconsin
The Clinton campaign today released the following response to the new Obama campaign TV ad currently being aired in Wisconsin:
"This ad makes clear why Sen. Obama doesn't want to have a one-on-one debate with Sen. Clinton in Wisconsin," Kathleen Falk, Dane County Executive said. "He doesn't want people to know that his health care plan leaves 15 million people out. He doesn't want people to know that Sen. Clinton's plan cuts health care costs more aggressively. And he certainly doesn't want people to know that the most authoritative source he can find to validate his housing plan is a story quoting his own campaign."
After 18 debates, with two more coming, Hillary says Barack Obama is ducking debates? It's the same old politics, of phony charges and false attacks.

 "Jonathan Gruber, a health economist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology who worked on the Massachusetts plan, said a mandate means "the difference between universal or near-universal coverage. Obama would have a large expansion, better than anything the Republicans have, but not universal coverage," Gruber said. "You can't get it without a mandate; it's just not possible." Gruber estimated that 15 million people would remain uninsured under Obama's plan." [Concord Monitor, 12/26/07]
 "Recent estimates suggest that a plan with uniform generous subsidies but without a mandate would cover no more than one-half of the uninsured in the U.S. Even with other cost-saving measures and a child mandate, we think that it is very likely that at least 15 million Americans would remain uninsured."

 "Barack Obama yesterday unveiled an economic stimulus package costing up to $120 billion that his campaign said would put money in the hands of workers and seniors, stem the foreclosure crisis, and cover state budget shortfalls." [AP, 1/14/08]
That's change we can believe in.
I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message.
