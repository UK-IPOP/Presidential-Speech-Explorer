The annual United States Government estimate of "Mexican Poppy Cultivation and Heroin Production" found poppy cultivation in Mexico decreased by 5 percent, from 44,100 hectares in 2017 to 41,800 hectares in 2018. Similarly, potential pure production decreased by 4 percent, from 111 metric tons in 2017 to 106 metric tons in 2018. Potential heroin production remained above 100 metric tons for the second consecutive year. However, ONDCP assesses that this slight decrease was due to record production in 2017.

Mexico continues to be the primary supplier of heroin to the United States; 91 percent of seized heroin examined by the Drug Enforcement Administration in 2017 was determined to have originated in Mexico. Poppy cultivation and heroin production in Mexico continue to threaten the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in 2017, 47,600 Americans, or 130 people per day, died of opioid involved overdoses and 15,482 of those deaths involved heroin.


President Donald J. Trump is focused on stopping the trafficking of heroin and other dangerous drugs coming from Mexico. He declared a National Emergency on our southern border in part to ensure the safety of the American people from these deadly drugs.
