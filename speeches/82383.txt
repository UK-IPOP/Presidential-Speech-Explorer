The President's jobs and economic growth plan will strengthen the economy by allowing Americans to keep more of their own money to spend, save, and invest-creating jobs. The President's plan calls for speeding up the tax relief already passed in 2001; ending the unfair double taxation of dividends; and giving small businesses new incentives to grow.
The President's proposal would provide:

  

  A family of four with an income of $40,000 would see their federal income taxes fall from $1,178 to $45 under the President's plan.


  

  A married couple, both aged 65, with income of $40,000 (of which $2,000 is dividends and $15,000 is Social Security benefits) would see their taxes decline under the President's growth package by $380 (from $930 to $550) in tax year 2003 ? a decline of 41 percent.

During the Congressional recess, members of the Bush Administration are traveling across the country to meet with workers, business leaders, seniors, investors and other Americans to discuss the President's agenda for jobs and economic growth.
