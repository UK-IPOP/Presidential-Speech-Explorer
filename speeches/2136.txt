GREAT AND GOOD FRIEND: Deeming it desirable to satisfy my curiosity in respect to your interesting country by obtaining in-formation through a source upon which I rely, I have for this purpose appointed Brevet Brigadier General Orville E. Babcock, of the army of the United States, to proceed to the Dominican Republic in the character of a special agent. Having been one of my aides-de-camp while I commanded the armies of the United States, and having since been intrusted by me with confidential business of importance, I have entire confidence in his integrity and intelligence, and I commend him to your excellency accordingly.
Written at Washington, the 13th day of July, A.D. 1869.
Your good friend, U.S. GRANT.
