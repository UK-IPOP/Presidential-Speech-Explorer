The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) introduced a free Opioid Guideline App that allows users to access the agency's recommendations on pain management and opioid treatment. The purpose of the app is to provide healthcare professionals and patients with quick reference materials on the prescription opioid overdose crisis and help them make informed clinical decisions. Features include a useful and intuitive Morphine Milligram Equivalent (MME) calculator for drugs such as hydrocodone, transdermal fentanyl, and other opioids. Additionally, the app contains summaries of key guideline recommendations, a glossary of terms, and an interactive motivational interview feature.
