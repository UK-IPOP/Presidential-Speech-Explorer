The Senate passed by unanimous consent Tuesday evening legislation that aims to crackdown on the Lebanon-based group's access to money and logistical support. The bill was put forth by Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla), who is running for president, and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.).

The legislation would let the administration sanction any banks that knowingly work with Hezbollah or supporters of the group. It would also require the administration to hand over a report detailing foreign financial institutions that are aiding the terrorist group or supporters.

Rubio said that the legislation would help "guarantee that our government is focused on eliminating this terrorist group."

"We cannot afford to jeopardize our national security by letting Iran's leading terrorist proxy, Hezbollah, continue to pose a direct threat to us and our allies including Israel," he added. "It is time for us to reveal the expansiveness of its dangerous network."Â
