Mr. Chancellor, Mr. Vice President, My Friends:
Mr. Chancellor, we should like very simply but very sincerely to welcome you and your party to this country. We realize that in this room--among your associates--is much of the leadership of modern democratic Germany. With the German people, we believe that we share many great ideals and aspirations. Among those are the ideals and aspirations that pertain to the great concepts of human liberty and dignity.
We have admired the courage--the persistence--with which you, Mr. Chancellor, have advanced this kind of thinking in modern Germany. And, sir, I assure you that we are quite certain that no other individual of modern times has been more effective than you in helping to translate these ideals into practical policy.
So it is with a great deal of satisfaction that I ask the company to rise and to drink a toast to the German people and to President Heuss. President Heuss.
