The motorcade reached Westlands, a building at Sarah Lawrence College, at 5:34 pm.
No sight of POTUS.
People watched on the neighborhood streets as we passed. One man held a "Zeldin for Governor" lawn sign.
The stage is outside near a display of the NY state flag and a "Vote New York" sign. There are 1,150 people here, with 200 still in line, per the WH.
Rep. Bowman startled the crowd with the volume of his opening remarks. "Thats not loud enough" he said. Folks are booing after mentions of Zeldin. They're repeating chants, now, of "stop lying" in reference to Republicans

(Co-pooler Erin Logan also mentioned in the pre-show that this is the first rally on this trip we've heard play a Taylor Swift song: "Fearless," the original version.)
The president finished speaking at 6:57 pm.
We're rolling 7:13 pm.
(Check quotes to audio.
He was energized, jokingly showing surprise to chants of "Biden."
Near the start of his speech, there were a few hecklers out of my sight, one of whom chanted "four more years." Co-pooler Erin Logan saw at least one Biden aide direct one of the hecklers to leave the rally. Another official escorted the heckler about 50 feet through the crowd; he walked himself out and about five Biden supporters yelled at him as he departed.
Some digs at Rep. Zeldin, mentioning that the congressman voted against the infrastructure bill and the IRA. There were boos every time the president mentioned Rep. Zeldin's name.
A list of the recent trips the president has taken to New York, highlighting business investments in the state. Ditto with the Dem bills passed this year and his record on the deficit.
"We're the ones bringing down the debt. They're the ones who raise it," nodding to Republicans.
Big cheers after references to student debt relief. "Their hypocrisy's unbelievable" he said of Republican opposition to it. Every Republican mentioned elicited loud boos.

"Gov Hochul's opponent talks a good game on crime. But it's all talk," he said. The president mentioned the ARP and its funding for police, teachers, firefighters, etc and that Republicans voted against it. "And then they whine about how they're so tough," he said. A lot of messaging on crime tied to gun control.
"Kathy's opponent is one of those election deniers."
"For these election deniers, there are only two outcomes for an election: Either they win or they were cheated"
A little girl in the crowd was jumping up and down to try and see the president.
His Meachem-esque unity message at the end.
Towards the end of a remarks, Biden seemed to notice someone in the audience having a medical emergency. POTUS halted the rally until the person got help. The person was moved to a chair near the back fence. Co-pooler Erin Logan saw a young red haired woman seated near an EMT drinking out of a paper cup near the fence.
As the president exited someone in the crowd – holding a sign that read "5 more years of drilling is a lose lose!" – shouted a question, to which the president said something about no "new drilling" and "that was before I was president." Afterward he motioned that the person should write him her name. Per a photog, the president spoke with her immediately after.
The pool saw President Biden board AF1 at 7:41 pm. He turned and waved at the top of the stairs.
We’re about to get on the plane.

Good evening everyone -- I'm your in-town pool.
Marine One landed on the White House's south lawn at 9:01 p.m.
President Biden stepped out of M1 at 9:03 p.m. He very casually walked across the south lawn and waved at the pool and staff assembled and walked straight inside the White House.
Pool was escorted back to the Palm Room doors at 9:08p.m. and a lid was called.
Have a great night everyone!
