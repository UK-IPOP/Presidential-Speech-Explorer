Today, the Clinton campaign released the following statement from National Press Secretary Brian Fallon:
According to the 
, under Bernie Sanders' 2013 health care bill, "poor and middle-class taxpayers would have seen tax increases totaling nearly 9 percent."
Legislation introduced and supported by Sanders includes a new 6.7% payroll tax, (Sec. 811), and a new 2.2% income tax on individuals and families (Sec. 812).
Independent experts confirmed to the 
 that it is impossible to pay for Sanders' single-payer plan without raising taxes on middle-class households: "'I can confidently say we can't raise that much by taxing the rich,' said Len Burman, who directs the Tax Policy Center."
Austan Goolsbee, Former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, 
 even further tax increases on the middle class would be necessary to pay for the rest of Sanders' proposals beyond single-payer healthcare: "On the non-health side, the Sanders proposals are well above the $3.3-$3.5 trillion mentioned in the [Wall Street Journal and Washington Post] articles. Realistically, his proposals are $5 trillion+ [beyond $15 trillion in health care spending]. At that size, you almost certainly need taxes on the middle class to pay for them."
