In relating science and technology to the fruitful development of its great continent, Australia encounters many of the same problems that confront the United States in meeting national needs and objectives. Closer cooperation will advance the state of science to the mutual benefit of both countries. I hope that the talented science communities of our two countries will also find ways together to promote the application of science and technology to national and regional development for the benefit of neighboring countries in Asia and the Pacific area.
