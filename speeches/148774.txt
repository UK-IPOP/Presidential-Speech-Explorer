As part of an ongoing Administration-wide effort to prevent, deter, and punish identity theft and other forms of pandemic fraud by serious criminal syndicates, the President will announce in the State of the Union tonight:
 The dramatic outpouring of pandemic relief in 2020 saw an expansion of foreign and domestic criminal syndicates defrauding unemployment insurance and other benefits programs to rob American taxpayers of billions of dollars that should have gone to support deserving small businesses and workers who had lost their jobs. The Federal Trade Commission reported a 3000% increase in reports of identity theft involving public benefits from 2019 to 2020. The Administration has taken significant actions already to respond to this inherited fraud.
