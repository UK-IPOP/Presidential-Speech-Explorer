 "Of all the problems Giuliani will face, none will loom larger – or sooner – than the question of what to do about the city's finances. Under a tough law passed after the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970s, he will be required to explain in January how he plans to close the gap in the current year's budget, estimated at about $ 400 million. Soon after, he will be required to come up with the outline of his budget for the fiscal year starting next summer, which currently contains a projected $1.5-billion deficit."

 "Two men with Jordanian passports were arrested yesterday morning in a Brooklyn apartment, where police officers found components of one or more pipe bombs — evidence of what the authorities say was a terrorist plot to detonate bombs in the busy Atlantic Avenue subway station and on a commuter bus. The two suspects were shot after a team of New York City police officers, acting on a tip from a man who lived with the two, burst into the Park Slope apartment an hour before dawn."

 Right after coming into office, Giuliani announced a Federal 'sweep' to rid Manhattan's Lower East Side streets of small-time drug dealers. Most Federal prosecutors believe their limited resources for drug enforcement should be concentrated on international cases. They leave the $40 'busts' to local authorities. Not Giuliani. He said his office could do both." (Michael Winerip, "High-Profile Prosecutor," The New York Times, 6/9/85)
 Frontline's Mark Obenhaus: "The revelation that officials as powerful as Donald Manes and Stanley Freidman were corrupt has shaken public confidence in New York City government. The scandal has spawned a wrath of other investigations. During 1986 and 1987, the Commissioners of Hospitals, Taxis, Transportation, Cultural Affairs, Business Development, two members of the City Planning Commission, a borough president and a United States Congressman all resigned or were under indictment."

 "At the Justice Department, Mr. Giuliani has been highly visible, particularly as one of the chief strategists of the Reagan Administration's stepped-up effort to combat narcotics trafficking. He was instrumental in devising the Reagan budget request of $130 million granted by Congress last year to finance 12 new investigative drug task forces across the nation."

 "The federal government brings 35,000 criminal cases a year, the majority for property rather than violent crimes. In 1979, the last full year for which the FBI has figures, there were 1,178,540 violent crimes reported to police in the United States. The overwhelming majority of these violent crimes of murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault did not violate federal law. In addition, the federal government has reliable evidence that for each violent crime reported to the police in the United States, two others go unreported." (Michael J. Sniffen, "Top Justice Official Says Rehabilitation Key To Reducing Violent Crime," The Associated Press, 8/19/81)

 "At least a few New Yorkers have long despaired of making non-New Yorkers grasp the gargantuan perversity of the city's welfare system. Help has arrived. 'Hands to Work,' by Columbia journalism Prof. LynNell Hancock, purports to be an expose of welfare reform under Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. It is far more profitably read as a breathtaking tour of the mindset — supplied by the author and by those she writes about — that for decades made New York the welfare capital of the world."

Our moral critique of the welfare state is going to accelerate, and the place it's happening is at the state and local governments. I mean, Giuliani, in his real reform of welfare, is in fact, behaving as an absolute revolutionary." (Newt Gingrich, Remarks At Progress And Freedom Foundation Conference, Washington, DC, 1/22/96)
 "The Giuliani administration, which created the nation's largest and most successful workfare program among single adults in the Home Relief program, is now extending the work requirement to recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children i.e., single mothers.

 KATIE COURIC: "[W]hat will be the major goal of your second term?" MAYOR GIULIANI: "Well, it will be to reduce drugs the same way we have reduced crime, to see if we can remove the problem of drugs from our schools, from our neighborhoods, away from our children …" (NBC's "Today," 11/5/97)
 "That is precisely why Mayor Giuliani said the city wants to commit to 40-block swaths of the Morrisania and Bed-Stuy neighborhoods, pushing out drug dealers while adding even more housing units to the area. The new program also will work with landlords to help them repair their properties. 'When drugs are the problem, a stable, thriving community is the solution,' Giuliani said. … Looking out at an audience that included neighborhood leaders and dozens of pre-schoolers, Giuliani noted, 'We're all in this together, and to the extent that we can reduce the influence of drugs and remove it, we give each one of these children a much greater chance of having a successful life.'"

 "Appearing before an adult video store in Queens, where new shops have met vociferous protests for more than a year, Mr. Giuliani said the city needed 'reasonable regulations' to halt the spread of 'sex shops' in places where New Yorkers and their children live.

They cost us money.'" (Steve Lee Myers, "Giuliani Proposes Toughening Laws On X-Rated Shops," The New York Times, 9/11/94)

'Keeping children safe is a huge responsibility,' Mayor Giuliani said. 'The Administration for Children's Services works hard every day to protect the children of New York City. And we're very grateful to the United Way for their help in this vital effort. The Kinderprint Child Identification Kit helps parents to protect their children in the case of an emergency. And it helps the police reunite missing children with relieved and joyous parents.'"
