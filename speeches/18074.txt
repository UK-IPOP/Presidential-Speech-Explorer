I STRONGLY ENDORSE this opening campaign of the American-Korean Foundation to be held June 7th to 14th.
Our own fighting men in Korea have been contributing to the cause of Korean assistance much more than have we who have remained at home. Our forces, having seen the great and cruel needs of the Korean people, have responded in typical American fashion. Now those needs will be further increased by the return of sick and injured South Korean troops.
By contributing to this cause we can support the personal efforts of our own troops. We will help sustain the power of the Korean military effort. Moreover, we will demonstrate to our Korean allies our sincere desire to develop ties of mutual understanding and appreciation between America and the people of Korea.
