Good afternoon!

I am your pooler for Vice President Kamala Harris' roundtable this afternoon on reproductive rights with Latina state legislators and leaders.

The roundtable is being held inside the VP's Ceremonial Office and is set to begin at 3 p.m. ET. It is being live streamed at 
.

The pool is tested and gathered inside the Eisenhower Executive Office Building and awaiting the roundtableâ€™s start.

More on background below.



 








Pool was ushered up stair case no. 5 at 2:59 pm and were brought into the VP Ceremonial Room at 3:02 pm.


VP began her remarks at 3:03 pm ET. Reminder it is being Live streamed at WhiteHouse.gov/Live.


VP Harris referenced the Kansas ballot measure to protect abortion rights.

Here are some pulled quotes. Please check against transcript, that I will send at the end of my pool report.

"In Kansas , the people of Kansas made clear to support and trust women to make decisions about their own body and what is in their best interest without the need for the government to tell them what to do."

"Latina leaders across America frontlines leading on this issue."

"We believe that having to make that decision, they are smart enough to make it. They have agency to make that decision."

"Latinas are less likely to have private insurance and what that means about what options are available or not available."

VP welcomed the invited leaders of the roundtable and reiterated the interagency work being done by the administration to protect reproductive care. She emphasized the importance of "collaboration" with leaders like those assembled at today's Roundtable.


Pool was ushered out of the VP ceremonial office at 3:26pm after opening remarks from roundtable participants.

In a previous pool, I mentioned sending a transcript, but again, it was live-streamed so please refer to that.


Pool headed down from the second floor of EEOB at 3:30pm and was dismissed at 3:32pm. Have a great weekend!
