The United States and Japan today announced the membership of the U.S.-Japan Private Sector/Government Commission for the year 2002. The Commission, made up of U.S. and Japanese government and private sector representatives, was launched in June 2001 by President Bush and Prime Minister Koizumi as an integral feature of the U.S.-Japan Economic Partnership for Growth. The aim of the Commission is to more fully integrate the U.S. and Japanese private sectors into the economic work of the two governments. As the United States and Japanese Governments work together to tackle a range of difficult economic issues, the private sector is in a unique position to offer its expertise and recommendations.
The Commission is scheduled to have its inaugural meeting in the Tokyo area in the spring and will address the following topics: "Creating an Environment for Sustainable Growth: Raising Productivity and Corporate Revitalization."
