Your Majesty:
As you can tell from the reception you have received today, you are among friends. We welcome you again as one who has visited our country before and we say as you come again that we think you come at a very appropriate time.
As we all know, the area of the world in which you rule is one that presently has some very explosive problems. And in order to solve those problems, leadership is required--leadership from within that area. The kind of leadership that is required I would describe as having three qualities: the quality of courage, the quality of wisdom, and the quality of moderation.
And it is those three qualities that we in this country have seen in you, Your Majesty, through the years. You have been a man of courage and you have captured the imagination of our people because of that courage. You have been a man of wisdom and you have been a man of moderation.
And for that reason, we look forward to the conversations we will have with you and with members of your Government in attempting to find new avenues that could lead to permanent peace in that troubled area of the world.
We welcome you, then, today as an old friend. We welcome you, too, as one with whom we look forward to searching together for a new period of peace and understanding in the Middle Eastern area of the world.
