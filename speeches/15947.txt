THE PRESIDENT announced today that, in accordance with his recommendations, the Federal Inter-Agency Basin Committee has established an Arkansas-White-Red River Basins Inter-Agency Committee. The purpose of the new Committee is to facilitate the study and development of comprehensive integrated plans of improvement of water and related land resources of those basins as authorized in the 1950 Flood Control Act.
The newly formed Basin Inter-Agency Committee will consist of one field representative each from the Corps of Engineers, Department of the Army, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Interior, the Department of Commerce, the Federal Power Commission, and the Federal Security Agency.
The Governors of Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Kansas, and Missouri, States lying wholly or in part in the Arkansas-White-Red Rivers drainage area, will be asked to participate in the regular meetings of the Basin Committee, to insure that local viewpoints on all problems shall be given the fullest consideration by the Federal agencies in the study and preparation of a single comprehensive report. Regular meetings of the Committee will be scheduled once each month at designated points within the basins.
