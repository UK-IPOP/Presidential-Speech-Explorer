America's growing economy requires a flexible, highly skilled workforce, and the President is committed to providing American workers with the training they need to succeed. President Bush believes we must ensure every adult, especially low- and middle-income Americans, can access the training necessary to close the skills gap in America, and his new proposals are designed to give states more flexibility to fill high growth jobs with skilled American workers, and to hold states accountable for employment results.
States need additional flexibility to provide workers with the training they need. Since the Workforce Investment Act was enacted in 1998, 41 states have asked the Federal government for 162 waivers to gain the flexibility needed to respond to economic conditions. The current system of Federal job training programs is too complex, with multiple funding streams and too many resources are spent on bureaucracy rather than training.
