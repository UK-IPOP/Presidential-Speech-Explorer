THE White House meeting will be an intellectual convocation of the States. Its object will be to get underway in each State a study group of the highest expertness--consisting of men and women drawn from all the faculties in the State and of experts outside the universities--which at a specific time will be ready to report on the problems and possibilities of that particular State and region during the coming decades.
Our American system is the happy one of federalism. Both the Federal Government and the States have always exercised leadership in solving the problems of the Nation. Through this conference, I hope to lend whatever help I can to the exciting process of revitalization now going on in our 50 States.
