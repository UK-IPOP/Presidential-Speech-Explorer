Dear Cliff:
It is with the deepest of regret, both personal and official, that I accept your request to leave the Cabinet.
You have served with high distinction as Secretary of Agriculture--both as an effective advocate for the American farmer and for the needs of rural America, and as a trusted adviser whose counsel at the Cabinet table has been wise and welcome. It has been a great satisfaction to me to know that I could always count on your excellent assistance in our efforts, which meant so much to both of us, to secure for the American farmer the better break that he deserves. The solid beginning we have made on the difficult task of bettering the conditions of life in rural America and restoring the economic vitality of the Nation's heartland will be a lasting testament to your skill, your energy and your dedication.
It has been a great pleasure to serve with you. As you return to private life, you do so with my profound gratitude for all that you have contributed as a member of the administration. Pat joins me in wishing you and Martha the very best, and in the hope that we will see you often in the years ahead; and I look forward to what I am sure will be many opportunities to continue drawing on your rich storehouse of wisdom and experience.

With warm personal regards,

Sincerely,
RICHARD NIXON
[Honorable Clifford M. Hardin, Secretary of Agriculture]
