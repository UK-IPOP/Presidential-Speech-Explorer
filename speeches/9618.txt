My dear Mr. Brown:
Universal Bible Sunday once a year brings to all our people simultaneously a concerted stimulus to study the Bible and to ponder its inexhaustible wealth of inspiration and example. The spiritual life is enriched by the annual observance of this day.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
