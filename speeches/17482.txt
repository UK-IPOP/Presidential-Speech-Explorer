My Friends:
It is a privilege to welcome to this country and to this house the President of Haiti and Mrs. Magloire. He comes from a Republic with which ours has a long record of friendship. We know that his visit can serve only to strengthen and to give fresh vigor and vitality to those ties.
We do trust that while they and their party are here in our country, they will find themselves in the midst of people that they feel are welcoming them to our shores, and extending to them the warm hand of hospitality.
When they go back home, we trust that they will have even a deeper affection than ever for this country and for our people--as we shall have for them.
So, as a token of our welcome to them, will you rise to drink, with me, a Toast to President and Mrs. Magloire.
