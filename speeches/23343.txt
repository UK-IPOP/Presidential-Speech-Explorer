Dear Mr. Secretary:
I have read your interim report to me on the administration of Public Law 78 under which Mexican Nationals are brought into this country to meet seasonal shortages of domestic farm labor.
I am heartened by the improvements made in implementing this law. The actions recently taken to further safeguard the interests of American farm workers are also encouraging. You will, I know, continue your efforts to improve the operation of the program in this respect.
JOHN F. KENNEDY
