My dear Admiral Cowie:
The great citizen components of the Army of the United States constitute an organized expression of patriotic citizenship. On Army Day, I wish to express the gratitude of the Nation to those who exposed their lives to the dangers of the battlefield and those who fell in defense of our national ideals.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Rear Adm. T. J. Cowie, Commander-in-Chief, Military Order of the World War, Washington, D.C.]
