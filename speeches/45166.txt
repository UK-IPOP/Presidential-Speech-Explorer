The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3011 because it contains spending totals that are substantially over the Congressional budget resolution. The President's senior advisors could not recommend that he sign the bill in its present form.

The bill purports to make $8.1 billion available. Actual spending authority will be $9.7 billion, however, because the Committee has failed to count:

Only by failing to count these substantial expenditures — which put the total bill cost nearly 20% higher than that c 1 aimed by the Committee — does the bill fall within the Congressional budget resolution guidelines.

The amounts included in the bill exceed the President's request by $260 million for energy conservation and by $137 million for land acquisition. Language provisions in the bill relating to employment ceilings, reorganizations, and reprogrammings violate the Constitutional legislative process that requires approval by the full Congress and the President.

The Administration urges the Senate to eliminate the $750 million in appropriations for the new clean coal demonstration program — a program not provided for in the budget resolution — and to make other reductions necessary to bring the bill within the Congressional budget resolution. The Administration also urges deletion of the other unwarranted spending and objectionable language provisions identified in the attachment.

The President's senior advisors could not recommend that he sign this bill given the continued presence of excessive amounts for the total bill and for the above programs and the objectionable language provisions.
