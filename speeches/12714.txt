 the annual fire loss in the United States includes thousands of human lives taken and hundreds of millions of dollars of property values destroyed; and
 this loss has been materially reduced by the preventive measures adopted during recent years; andÂ 
 further improvement can be brought about by our common effort to eliminate fire hazards and to prevent destructive fires in the home, school, factory, and forest, and on the farm:
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim and designate the week beginning October 4, 1936, as Fire Prevention Week, and I invite the cooperation of all of our people in the further elimination of existing fire hazards to the end that the loss of life, the destruction of property, and the suffering caused thereby may be still further reduced.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 2d day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-first.
FRANKLIN D ROOSEVELT
