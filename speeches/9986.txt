THE PRESIDENT said:
"The appropriation bills passed by the Congress when taking into account mere postponements to later deficiency bills show that the total appropriations for the next fiscal year were approximately $161 million above the President's recommendations. Of this increase, $130,900,000 is in the independent offices bill. The President is not signing this bill in order that it may be reviewed in the next session."
