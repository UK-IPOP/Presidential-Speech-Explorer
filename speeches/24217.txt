Dear Mr. Secretary:
I appreciate your report on the steps that have been taken and are under way to improve the management and the effectiveness of the several vital programs administered by the Forest Service.
Historically, the Forest Service has been an outstanding leader in management. The further actions set forth in your letter indicate clearly that the Forest Service and you intend to do everything possible to maintain this well-earned reputation.
I am particularly pleased with the broad range of the management actions in the Forest Service. These include: improved cooperation with State and private forestry programs; strengthening of field organizations; greater use of private investment and initiative in meeting public needs, and improved financial management. These are several of the major management objectives on which I place particular importance and the ones I expect all agencies to achieve.
Mr. Secretary, I wish to commend you for the support you have given to the Joint Management Review Program. As you know, I have encouraged all departments and agencies to take advantage of this program. One of the surest ways of achieving and maintaining excellence is by self-evaluation, criticism, and improvement. Again, let me commend you and the Forest Service for both your approach to improved management and for the excellent results you are achieving.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[Honorable Orville L. Freeman, Secretary of Agriculture, Washington, D.C. 20250]
