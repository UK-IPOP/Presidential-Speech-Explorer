[ Released January 18, 1954. Dated January 16, 1954 ]
I appreciate very much your thoughtfulness in writing me relative to the progress that has been made by the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government.
The nation is faced with basic issues that must be resolved in every one of the areas that you have selected for study. You have enlisted the services of some of our most outstanding leaders for membership on the task forces that you have established to carry forward these studies. Please convey to them my personal appreciation of their willingness to serve in this manner.
As you know I have a very real interest in the outcome of the work of the Commission. We are determined to do everything we can to put into effect sound principles of management in the conduct of the affairs of government. I look forward to having the benefit of your recommendations.
The time, thought, and energy that you are putting into this program as Chairman of the Commission is a source of real inspiration to all of us. The country is to be congratulated that you have once again been willing to undertake leadership in this work.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
