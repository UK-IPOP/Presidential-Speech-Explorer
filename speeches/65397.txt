 President Kim, are you excited about the opportunity for a breakthrough with the dialog between North and South Korea?
 Yes. I think that there is a possibility.
 And do you welcome the fact that China might participate as well?
 Well, we'll have a chance to talk about it later at the press conference.
 Mr. President, was it as pretty down on the beach as it looked from up above?
 Yes. I felt like a honeymooner again.
