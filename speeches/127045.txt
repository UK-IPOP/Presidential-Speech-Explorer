Marco Rubio is a compelling leader who can unite the country around conservative principles that will improve the lives of all Americans. The stakes for our great country are too high — and the differences between the candidates too great — for me to remain neutral in this race. I wholeheartedly trust Marco to keep us safe and ensure a better tomorrow, and I look forward to campaigning with him later this week.
