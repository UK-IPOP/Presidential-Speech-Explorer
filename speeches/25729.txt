I LEARNED with great sorrow of the death in Helsinki of Sakari Tuomioja. He served your nation well, and served all nations by his work for the United Nations. He died while laboring once again as United Nations mediator in a tangled and dangerous international dispute. Our people join with yours in mourning a servant of peace, and a friend of us all.
