Please check quotes against official transcript.
Harris started by "saying thank you to all of you You are courageous leaders, and you are American patriots."
"All citizens have the right to vote, Constitutionally. What we are seeing are examples of an attempt to marginalize and take from people, a right that has already been given. We are not asking for the bestowal of a right. We are talking about the preservation. That is the right of citizenship. And It's that fundamental."
She alluded to the Shelby v Holder case, which she called "an opening of a door" for making it difficult for people to vote.
"We know we have a great challenge in front of us and therefore a fight, which is to fight for every American's right."
Background on the mtg. provided by VPOTUS office.
At the meeting, they will discuss the restrictive voting measures that already exist in Texas, the measures that would have been added under Texas Senate Bill 7 (SB7), and the path forward to make voting more accessible for all Americans
