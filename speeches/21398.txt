My deepest gratitude to you and to all of the officers of your union for your expression of support for my candidacy for President.
I am particularly moved by the endorsement of the International Association of Bridge, Structural, and Ornamental Iron Workers since I am informed that this is only the second time in your long history that you have taken such action in a national election campaign.
I accept your resolution of support with all humility but not without some pride that your first endorsement was for a great Democratic President, Franklin D. Roosevelt.
You have my pledge that I will do all in my power to live up to the faith and trust you place in me by your action. I will continue in the future, as I have during my 14 years in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives to fight for the interests of the majority of the people. It is my firm belief that we can build a stronger and healthier America to work toward our goal of peace with justice throughout the world. That is my goal and, working togetber, I am confident we can achieve it.
JOHN F. KENNEDY
