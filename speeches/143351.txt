Greetings from JBA. I’ll be your print pooler today for POTUS’s trip to the Chicago area.
M1 touched down at JBA at 1220.
POTUS did not respond to shouted Qs. Boarded AF1 at 1225.
AF1 rolling for ORD at 1229.
Greeting the President at Joint Base Andrews:
Traveling with the President to Chicago, Illinois:
WH principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre is slated to gaggle en route. Audio is expected to be piped into the WH YouTube page.
Here’s some background the WH distributed on the purpose of the trip:
From a White House official:
Today, the White House released a 
 on how vaccination requirements are helping to drive up vaccination rates, put people back to work, and strengthen the economy. This extensive analysis looks at existing vaccination requirements in health care systems, educational institutions, businesses, and the public sector and demonstrates with data that vaccination requirements work and will accelerate our path out of the pandemic.
The report was released ahead of the President’s visit to Chicago today, where he will meet with public and private sector leaders who have implemented vaccination requirements, including Governor Pritzker, Mayor Lightfoot, and United CEO Scott Kirby. The President will visit a construction site in Elk Grove Village being built by Clayco, one of the largest construction companies in the Midwest. At the event, Clayco will announce their strong support of the President’s plan to require vaccinations or weekly testing, and importantly, they will implement a system of vaccinations or testing to all of their employees, in line with the President’s requirements.
The President’s message will be clear: Vaccination requirements work. Vaccination requirements get more people vaccinated, helping to end the pandemic and strengthen the economy. That’s why he’s leading on implementing vaccination requirements for 100 million workers—two-thirds of all workers in the U.S. And that’s why we’re seeing growing momentum for vaccination requirements across sectors and across the country.
The report can be viewed at 
.
And here’s the trip schedule, per WH:
AF1 wheels down at ORD 1258 CT. Note the time zone change. POTUS deplaned 107. Overcast skies. (AF1 was wheels up from JBA at 1235 ET.)
Some news: POTUS, when asked "do you support the short-term debt ceiling deal," crossed his fingers.
Asked if he would sign it, POTUS responded but it was hard to hear his response. It sounded like we have to make sure there is a deal. (but please check video/transcript to be sure.)
Upon arrival, POTUS was greeted by the following, with whom he spoke to for several minutes on the tarmac, including one-on-one w Lightfoot.
Karine Jean-Pierre gaggled in-flight. She covered debt ceiling (deal is "positive step"; no commitment yet on signing it), the prospect of vaccine mandates for commercial flights ("no options are off the table") meeting with Manchin, Texas abortion ruling and energy issues. Full audio here:
Motorcade rolling at 115 pm CT.
Upon closer review and consultations with fellow poolers, POTUS appeared to say, "we gotta see if the deal is done. I'm not sure of that yet." Video and audio below:

?Motorcade arrived at 139 pm at a Clayco construction site in Elk Grove Village, Ill.
Sizeable protest nearby as motorcade rolled past. Lots of pro-Trump, anti-Biden signs. One said "Fuck Biden." Another said Trump won. Also a lot of anti-abortion signs.
One sign said "Mandates are 4 Greed and power."
Lots of people on the side of the road not hostile to Biden taking pictures as we rolled by. Pool making way in now. No eyes on POTUS.
Per WH, POTUS is now participating in a photo line with:
Pool is currently holding at indoor site where POTUS will later speak. Here’s what the room looks like:
Pool was briefly was led into the facility being built to observe POTUS getting a tour of it. (Details below on those who joined him, per WH. I also took a couple photos and posted at bottom.) Pool was moved out after about 10 mins.
During the second tour stop, POTUS greeted workers with handshakes and touted his federal vaccine mandate. "It's beginning to make a profound change," he said. He mentioned United Airlines. With some sadness in his voice, he said, "700,000 people dead in the United States."
During the first tour stop, POTUS greeted workers with arm bumps and asked questions about the work, like, "Tell me what you're doing here?" and how much will this be built out?" "It's union?" He was told the facility will be done early next year.
Info on who POTUS met with here, per WH:
Before the start of the tour at the Clayco Construction Site, where in Elk Grove Village, Illinois, POTUS greeted with:

POTUS started speaking at 256 pm Central Time.
Remarks being steamed live here:
Intro speakers touted vaccines and the Microsoft project here. Speaking program, per WH:
POTUS speech concluded at 419 Central Time. POTUS spoke against backdrops that said "Vacccines.gov" and "Build Back Better." A large red CLAYCO sign hung above and behind them.
His remarks were streamed live. Here are some quotes: (As always, please check against the transcript and video for accuracy)
"We're headed in the right direction if we don't -- if we keep our eye on the ball here. We still have a long way to go."
"The unvaccinated also put our economy at risk because people are reluctant to go out."
"Because they're worried they're going to get sick. I've tried everything in my power to get people vaccinated."
"While I didn't race to do it right away, that's why I've had to move toward requirements that everyone get vaccinated, where I had the authority to do that. That wasn't my first instinct."
"More people are getting vaccinated. More lives are being saved. Let's be clear: When you see headlines and reports of mass firings and hundreds of people losing their jobs, look at the bigger story."
"This I always get a kick out of: Fox News. Fox News requires vaccinations for all their employees." Biden said with an overt whipser. Some in the crowd laughed clapped. "Gimme a break, Fox News," Biden added.
"We've made real progress across the board."
"Today: I'm calling on more employers to act. My message is require your employees to get vaccinated."
"For folks who haven't gotten vaccinated, get it done."
"We have a plan. We have the tools. ... We just have to finish the job."
POTUS repeatedly touted labor in his speech.
POTUS "is participating in a political photo line with DNC supporters," according to the WH. Pool is now loaded into vans and holding.
One apparent anti-Biden protester could be heard (but not seen) speaking over a loudspeaker somewhere nearby as the pool walked out. "We're all waving at you to let you know how much you suck," said the voice.
