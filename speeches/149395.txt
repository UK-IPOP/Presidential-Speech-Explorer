Good evening, and a happy bday to today's pooler, Hailey Fuchs.
The pool is gathering now at the White House for a very short walk and then a possible ride to a "local OTR."
At 6:57 p.m., the motorcade rode by the press vans in front of the White House, and the pool joined for the 15-second ride to the Renwick Gallery. POTUS and FLOTUS are attending the wedding rehearsal dinner of their granddaughter, Naomi Biden, and Peter Neal. The dinner is hosted by Drs. Mary and William Neal. The pool is holding in the vans.
Pool about 9:49 p.m. spotted First lady Jill Biden walking in front of the vans and back to the White House from the Renwick Gallery.
A man who appeared to be Hunter Biden (he was carrying a young child) walked out a minute later.
The motorcade about 9:51 p.m. departed the Renwick where POTUS and FLOTUS were celebrating the coming nuptials of their granddaughter, Naomi.
Pool did not see the president emerge from the building or enter the vehicle. The vans arrived at the White House at 9:53 p.m.
At 9:56.
