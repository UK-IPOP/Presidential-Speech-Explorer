 (Gov. Mike Huckabee, 
, 2007, p. 101)


 CBS' BOB SCHIEFFER: "But you did raise taxes, didn't you, Governor? I mean in addition to cutting taxes you did raise some taxes?" HUCKABEE: "Bob when you're under a Supreme Court order, you do what you need to do to improve your schools. I worked with our legislature. And we got major really improvements done in our school system that without our kids would still be languishing in last place. I don't apologize for raising the expectations and the hopes and the opportunities for the kids of my state. I don't apologize for building roads either. I'd apologize for leaving my roads in a mess is what I'd be apologizing for if I hadn't done it." (CBS' "Face The Nation," 1/13/08;

 "But a review of tax legislation passed while he was governor shows a net tax increase of $505 million, a figure adjusted for inflation and economic growth, according to the state Department of Finance and Administration. ... The 90 cuts reduced tax collections by $378 million, according to the Department of Finance and Administration. Meanwhile, the department counts 21 tax increases that raised collections by $883.1 million." (Daniel Nasaw, "Gaps Led To Taxing In Huckabee Years,"

 "As we've said several times now, Huckabee's 94 tax cuts include things like a reduction for manufacturing machinery that reduced state coffers by $500 per year. And, overall, his tax increases outweighed his tax cuts by more than $500 million. As for signing the first broad-based tax cut in 160 years, we've noted before that then-governor Bill Clinton signed an income-tax reduction in 1991 that was quite similar to the one that Huckabee signed a few years later. 'Broad-based' is a matter of interpretation, but Huckabee's claim still sounds like unwarranted hyperbole to us." (FactCheck.org,

 "The average Arkansan's tax burden grew from $1,969 in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 1997, to $2,902 in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2005, including local taxes." (Daniel Nasaw, "Gaps Led To Taxing In Huckabee Years,"
