The National Hurricane Center is forecasting an increasing risk of life-threating storm surge along the Gulf Coast. Additionally, there is an increasing risk of dangerous hurricane force winds and heavy rains.

Yesterday, FEMA received a request for an emergency declaration from Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards. The Governor requested assistance for emergency protective measures including direct federal assistance under the Public Assistance program for all 64 parishes.  President Joseph R. Biden approved an emergency declaration for the State of Louisiana earlier today.  The President’s action authorizes FEMA to provide emergency protective measures (Category B), including direct federal assistance at 75 percent federal funding. 

Now is the time for everyone to take urgent steps to prepare.
