There are 13 Operation Fly Formula flights currently scheduled for the week of June 20, projected to import approximately 4 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of infant formula to the United States. By June 26, Operation Fly Formula flights will have completed 32 flights and imported more than 17 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of infant formula.
Kendamil infant formula is being transported to the U.S. from the U.K. in donated cargo space aboard Delta Air Lines commercial flights. Kendamil infant formula will be distributed by Target through the company's national network of stores.
Under Operation Fly Formula, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the General Services Administration (GSA), and the Department of Defense (DOD) are partnering to import infant formula from other nations that meets U.S. health and safety standards, so it can get to store shelves faster.
