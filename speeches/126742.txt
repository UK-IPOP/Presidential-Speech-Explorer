Conservatives Praise Marco's Powerful Response to Donald Trump

 






 


Marco Rubio had a press statement and he gets it exactly right. Trump uses the rhetoric of a third world dictator and the protestors are really no better. The media, which often laments the lack of leaders and adults in American political discourse, tut-tut what is happening then plays it up for ratings.

We should all be ashamed of what is going on. There are no clean hands in this, but there are a lot of people who have descended to, "Well, he started it."
This is magnificent, and I recommend you watch the whole thing. I don't care whom you support, this needed saying.

This presser from Marco Rubio is about as unguarded and unscripted as you'll see a candidate before convention time:
