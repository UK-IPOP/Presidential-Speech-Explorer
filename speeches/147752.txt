 a Justice40 Week of Action to build on President Biden's Justice40 Initiative, which directs 40 percent of the benefits from climate, clean energy, affordable and sustainable housing, clean water, and other investments to disadvantaged communities.
President Biden's Executive Order on 
 laid the foundation for the most ambitious environmental justice agenda ever undertaken in United States history—committing to center communities overburdened by pollution, on the frontlines of climate impacts, and marginalized by decades of underinvestment in federal policies, priorities, and investments.
In total, hundreds of federal programs, representing billions of dollars in annual investment—including programs that were funded or created in the President's 
—are being transformed to maximize benefits to disadvantaged communities through the Justice40 Initiative.
This past week, the Biden-Harris Administration built on this progress with new actions, including:
The agencies have prioritized wells that impact disadvantaged communities in keeping with the Administration's 
 Initiative to deliver 40 percent of the benefits of climate and clean energy investments to disadvantaged communities.
 "President Biden is committed to advancing environmental and economic justice, including opening up opportunities for marginalized and overburdened communities. That is why, President Biden launched the Justice40 Initiative his first week in office and committed to direct 40 percent of the benefits of climate and clean energy investments in disadvantaged communities. States have an important role to play in the allocation of Federal formula funding. Today, the Biden Administration and Connecticut, New Mexico, and Oregon Governors are jointly committing to prioritize disadvantaged communities when allocating Federal formula funding." [Statement, 5/27/22]
 "At the core of our nation's environmental laws is a commitment to ensuring that all communities have a seat at the table. While our nation's record of protecting our most vulnerable from the impacts of pollution and climate change is not perfect, we are grateful for the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to engage with stakeholders from environmental justice communities. Today's report from CEQ demonstrates a clear commitment to considering the perspectives and priorities of those most impacted by our environmental policies. The report also presents a clear path forward for improving the way we deliver resources to those with the greatest need — a testimony to the power of inclusion in the federal decision-making process."

"Here's some good news - the Biden administration's Justice40 Initiative is making progress. That means: - Replacing polluting diesel school buses - Creating public transit hubs - Removing barriers to employment in the green workforce. Read the rest here – more to do, but this part is moving in the right direction." [

 "The Justice40 Initiative represents a historic commitment to advancing environmental justice, combatting long-standing inequities, and ensuring a healthier environment for every American, regardless of their zip code or socioeconomic status. The Biden-Harris administration has made important strides in supporting historically marginalized and disadvantaged communities across the United States. Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Environmental Protection Agency announced $500 million in federal funding to aid in the electrification of our nation's school bus fleet. The White House's Office of Management and Budget also announced nearly $30 billion in funding opportunities has been made available to communities in the United States. These announcements demonstrate the importance of strong executive leadership and collaboration with the Congress, and we will continue working to expand additional resources. While we have made important progress delivering on the Justice40 Initiative and fighting to advance environmental justice, there is still much work to be done. We have a responsibility to continue engaging with impacted communities, consider their lived realities, and tailor our approaches to mitigate worst impacts of environmental injustice in our nation. I urge the Biden-Harris administration to continue its efforts and uphold its commitment to delivering direct investments to vulnerable environmental justice communities. I will continue engaging with the Biden-Harris administration, CEQ, and the EPA to ensure we are maximizing our ability to deliver on the Justice40 Initiative. Together, we will continue making strides to dismantle historic inequities. [

"WE ACT for Environmental Justice has a long history of advocating for transportation policies, practices and investments that can deliver cleaner air, health improvements and economic justice in areas burdened by transportation pollution. Our Dirty Diesel Campaign led to the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) purchasing and placing cleaner buses on routes serving Northern Manhattan and to the achievement of a 95 percent reduction in tailpipe emissions citywide. Most recently, we successfully advocated for passage of Local Law 120 of 2021, which requires school buses that serve New York City Public Schools to be all electric by 2035. The launch of the first iteration of the Clean School Bus Rebate Program is momentous. It is a step in the right direction to addressing past injustices and will protect millions of children in New York by reducing their exposure to climate change causing greenhouse gas emissions and other harmful pollutants. Operating diesel school buses is detrimental to all children, and every community these buses travel through. But children of color are exposed to even more of this toxic pollution because buses are usually parked and often idling in their communities, adding to the cumulative impact of what is already significantly worse air quality. We look forward to working with the EPA to ensure that these frontline communities are prioritized." [

"Overall, we are pleased to see a formal response" to the advisory council's recommendations, outlined in Monday's report to Congress. We appreciate having a new target date for the proposed update" of the Clinton-era executive order but "will have to wait for its presentation to determine if it reflects the thoughtfulness, and reaches the level of ambition" the president's environmental justice advisers called for."

"Today, a report was released to Congress that details recommendations by WHEJAC, on which our founder, Dr. Beverly Wright, sits. We are proud that Federal agencies are acting on nearly 200 WHEJAC recommendations on the Justice40 Initiative." [

 "The White House has made important progress advancing the president's historic Justice40 Initiative and goal to deliver at least 40% of federal climate and infrastructure investment benefits to disadvantaged communities. Achieving the Justice40 goal would set the country on a long overdue course to correcting persistent injustice by mobilizing substantial new investments in legacy pollution cleanup, pollution-free energy and transportation, workforce development, quality affordable housing, and critical clean water infrastructure in communities that need it the most. There is still much work to be done to ensure that the federal government effectively invests in communities historically left behind, including action from Congress to pass the stalled budget reconciliation bill with crucial investments to advance environmental justice priorities. Congress must act now to secure substantial, long-overdue and much-needed climate and environmental justice investments through budget reconciliation legislation. The Senate must urgently pass a comprehensive package of investments to address the climate crisis and environmental injustice. This package must support environmental and climate justice block grants and other programs to clean up pollution and create toxic-free communities, healthy ports, and climate-resilient communities and infrastructure. The administration must also advance strong policies and regulations to reduce pollution. This includes developing and implementing a strong cumulative impacts policy and a regulatory strategy with an intentional focus on pollution reduction in low-income and Tribal communities, and in communities of color to improve public health and create economic opportunities in disadvantaged communities that have been historically marginalized and impacted by high levels of toxic air and water pollution. We welcome CEQ's Justice40 Week of Action to elevate and advance these important priorities, and engage with communities. A new series of Justice40 briefings, a new environmental justice website and a report responding to the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council's recommendations on implementing Justice40 and strengthening federal actions to protect the environment and public health for all communities are important ways to keep communities aware and involved. Now is the time for the administration to double-down on its whole-of-government approach, in direct engagement with communities, to ensure the promise of the Justice40 Initiative is fully achieved in communities across the country. Intentional community outreach is essential to ensuring effective Justice40 implementation. We look forward to continued work from CEQ to ensure the website is updated to meet the real-time needs of our communities. CEQ's Justice40 briefings will also provide a way for communities around the country to engage in the Justice40 process alongside other stakeholders. Integrating community feedback on Justice40 programs and the CEJST must be an essential part of moving this initiative forward in an inclusive way. All agencies must be held accountable for delivering on this mandate. EJNCP members looks forward to continuing our work with CEQ to support the historic Justice40 Initiative." [

"Discrimination, centuries of neglect, entrenched racial injustice, and the very real consequences of climate change in the form of natural disasters and extreme weather events, have left millions of low-income, frontline, and Black, Indigenous, and People of color (BIPOC) communities hurting. The historic impact of President Biden's Justice40 commitment could mark an important turning point in the long fight for justice. Climate philanthropy, and we at Energy Foundation, have a responsibility to be responsive and support groups to achieve not just the 40 percent marker, but also the shared decision-making and accountability that is necessary to achieve change. Justice40 is a big, ambitious effort—and implementing it properly will require groups on the ground be funded, and their leadership centered, in order to carry out the work required to engage with local, state, and regulatory agencies to make sure the money goes where it needs to go."

"The Biden-Harris Administration has made important progress in implementing its historic Justice40 Initiative and targeting long overdue investments to communities harmed by high levels of pollution and economic inequality. These investments are critical to improving the health and economic vitality of communities that have long borne the brunt of our nation's most toxic sources of pollution. From pollution clean-up and clean public transit to climate-resilient affordable housing and pollution-free energy, the Justice40 Initiative is key to addressing historic injustices in these neighborhoods, which are disproportionately communities of color. Despite this progress, the work is far from finished. The administration must fully engage with environmental justice communities and center their feedback as it continues to implement Justice40. Addressing decades of environmental injustice will require a whole-of-government approach and additional action. That includes offering technical support to local governments and community groups representing disadvantaged communities so they can successfully apply for federal grants. The administration also should simplify grant application processes to make federal funds more accessible and improve federal programs to maximize benefits to communities. And it's time for Congress to pass significant investments that spur immediate, meaningful action on climate and environmental justice at the scale of the problem." [

 "Today, @WHCEQ released a report submitted to Congress, outlining the historic steps the Biden-Harris Administration has taken to implement recommendations from the first-ever White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council (WHEJAC). The WHEJAC was established under Executive Order 14008 to fulfill @POTUS and @VP's commitment to confronting longstanding environmental injustices and ensuring marginalized, underserved, and overburdened communities have greater input on Federal policies and decisions. Today's report is a formal response to recommendations the WHEJAC provided on the #Justice40 Initiative, the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST), and revisions on Executive Order 12898. It also describes the scale and scope of efforts that the Federal Government has undertaken to deliver on the President's commitment to environmental justice. I am encouraged by the progress we have made over the past year. If we continue to listen to the voices and perspectives of the WHEJAC and other environmental justice leaders and communities, we will deliver a cleaner, healthier future for all." [
