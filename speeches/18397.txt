[Released September 22, 1953. Dated September 21, 1953]
- Dear Mr. Chancellor:
Thank you for your letter of August 30, 1953, in which you expressed the gratitude of the people of East Berlin and the Soviet occupied zone for the help given by the United States in the food relief program. I am glad that this program has helped to alleviate the great need of these unfortunate people whose courage in the face of oppression has been admired the world over.
At the same time you call my attention to the need for warm clothing and footwear for these same people--need which might become acute during the coming winter. I can assure you that this Government is aware of this need. It is my belief that the American people will gladly and liberally respond to your plea as many of them have done in similar situations in the past through various voluntary agencies. I shall therefore bring your letter to the attention of the American people knowing that they will contribute generously to the organizations which will undertake to provide such clothing and other required and related items.
Accept, Mr. Chancellor, the renewed assurance of my highest esteem.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
