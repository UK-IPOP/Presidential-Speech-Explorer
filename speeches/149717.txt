Our original 12:10 p.m. call time has been pushed back to 12:55, which presumably will impact the rest of today's schedule. POTUS is due to arrive back at the White House this afternoon, and has no public events listed.
Further updates to come on this lovely Monday.
Pool joined up with the POTUS motorcade at 2:37. We are en route to Delaware Air National Guard Base for the return to Washington.
Motorcade arrived at DANG at 2:45, POTUS then entered Marine One at 2:48.
Taking off shortly.
From the WH:
Steve Ricchetti, Assistant to the President & Counselor to the President
Marc Gustafson, Special Assistant to the President & Senior Director for the White House Situation Room
We lifted off via ospreys at 2:54, had a nice flight and landed at JBA at 3:18.
Handing off to the in-town pool. It has been an honor serving as your print pool reporter these last four days.

Good afternoon from a very quiet White House campus (except for the incessant sucking buzz of an excavation truck going full bore in the north driveway).
Pool is gathering now on the South Lawn for Marine One's arrival. The arrival is open press. More soon.
Marine One landed on the South Lawn at 3:46 p.m.
POTUS stepped down at 3:49, waved to the pool gathered in the driveway and walked alone across the lawn toward the West Wing, taking a wide berth and walking around the far end of the guard hose. No response to shouted questions, if he heard them at all.
He entered the Oval at 3:50.
The WH called a travel/photo lid at 3:58 p.m. Enjoy the rest of your day, all.
