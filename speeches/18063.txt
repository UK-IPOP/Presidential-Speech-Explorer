[Released May 12, 1953. Dated May 9, 1953]
- Dear General Gruenther:
By the action in the attached letters I am making you available for appointment as SACEUR to succeed General Ridgway.
I anticipate unanimous desire for this action because of the outstanding importance you bring in continuing the effectiveness and solidarity of N.A.T.O. You have served not only myself and General Ridgway with loyalty and splendid distinction, but have placed these same qualities unselfishly before N.A.T.O. As Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, I know the fine traditions and worthy objectives sought by all the nations will be upheld and carried forward through your leadership.
Let me give you assurance of my personal satisfaction in this matter. The appointment will be well deserved in all aspects.
Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
