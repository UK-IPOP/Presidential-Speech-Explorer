 Today, Governor Mitt Romney announced that 22 Members of the U.S. House of Representatives will be joining the Romney for President Exploratory Committee's Congressional Whip Team. The Members of Congress gathered at the Capitol Hill Club in Washington, D.C., to announce their support for Governor Romney.
Led by Representative Jim McCrery (R-LA), the Congressional Whip Team will continue Governor Romney's already successful outreach efforts to the U.S. House of Representatives.
"Our Congressional Whip Team represents some of America's finest leaders. Each has a depth of experience gained through years of service to the American people," said Governor Romney. "They will be powerful voices for our conservative agenda of lower taxes, smaller government, traditional values, and a safer America. I am honored that they are joining our Exploratory Committee."
