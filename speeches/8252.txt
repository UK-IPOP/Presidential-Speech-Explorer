I CONGRATULATE you most cordially upon the seventy-fifth anniversary of Lincoln University and wish you and all who have part in its labors all success in the future development of its splendid service in behalf of education and of the improvement of the condition of the negro and of his relations with the other races.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
