The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 5548 but will work in the Senate to:


— delete sections 8 and 9 prohibiting aid to Marxist-Leninist countries and Angola because they are unnecessary. The President already has the authority to assure that the Export-Import Bank undertakes no program not in the national interest. In addition, these provisions would jeopardize important U.S. interests and complicate our diplomatic efforts; and

— delete section 10 which would require the unrestricted transferability of new Eximbank guarantees. The requirement would result in increased competition with Treasury securities and ultimately raise Treasury borrowing costs, while largely benefitting commercial and investment bankers, not exporters.
