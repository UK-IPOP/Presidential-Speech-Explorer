The afflicting intelligence of the death of the illustrious Lafayette has been received by me this morning.
I have issued the general order inclosed * to cause appropriate honors to be paid by the Army and Navy to the memory of one so highly venerated and beloved by my countrymen, and whom Providence has been pleased to remove so unexpectedly from the agitating scenes of life.
ANDREW JACKSON
