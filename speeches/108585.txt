Mitt Romney today announced additional endorsements in Missouri.
"I am honored to have these Missouri leaders behind my campaign," said Mitt Romney. "With their help, I look forward to getting America back to work. Earning the support of Missouri voters will be critical in this campaign."
"Thanks to his experience in the private sector and as governor, I believe Mitt Romney is the best prepared to help get our nation's economy back on track," said U.S. Senator Roy Blunt (Mo.). "Missourians are tired of President Obama's costly economic policies, which have led to out-of-control spending, record federal debt, and fewer private sector jobs nationwide."
State Auditor Tom Schweich said, "I am proud to stand behind Mitt Romney in his campaign for president. His experience in the private sector makes him the best candidate in the race to turn around our economy. He will provide the much needed leadership in Washington to get Americans back to work and restore fiscal sanity in government."
