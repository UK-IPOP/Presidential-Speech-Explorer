I AM GRATIFIED to learn of so fine an instance of cooperation on the part of the community and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation as the opening of the banks of your city and the restoration of their fundamental service to the whole people. I have no doubt that benefits will show at once in business, in employment, in agriculture, and in the prosperity of the people of the town generally. Your enterprise and courage is an admirable instance of restoring confidence.
