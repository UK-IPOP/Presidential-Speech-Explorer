Statement from 
 president 
 on Rubio/Cruz & defunding PP: 


— Andrew Bair (@ProLifePolitics) 
Marco is passionately committed to the pro-life cause and has repeatedly voted to defund Planned Parenthood. Marco's unwavering defense of life is one of the reasons I so enthusiastically support him. I am bitterly disappointed Ted Cruz would try to intentionally mislead my fellow South Carolinians. The sanctity of life is not a political issue to many of us.  It is a moral, spiritual and human rights issue. I am not surprised when Democrats like Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Nancy Pelosi distort Marco's record.  I am surprised and disappointed when Ted Cruz does it.
Marco Rubio has been and always will be a staunch defender of life. For Ted Cruz to suggest otherwise is a disservice to the pro-life cause. We should be united in our fight to defund Planned Parenthood. Trying to create divisions and pit passionate pro-life leaders against each other is a disservice to the innocent unborn babies relying on us for help. We need a leader like Marco who can unite conservatives in the fight for life, not people like Ted Cruz who choose to weaken the pro-life movement for political gain.
This is jaw-droppingly dishonest

As a Cruz supporter, it's very, very difficult to buy any claim that Rubio is not a full-throated supporter of ending abortion in every form

Honestly I'm waiting for a Cruz supporter to condemn these baseless attacks on Rubio. It's getting to be gross
