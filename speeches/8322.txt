ON THE OCCASION of the first airmail departure from Argentina to the United States, I wish to express my gratification that the hopes [p.325] and plans for regular communication by air between North and South America, which were the subject of discussion during my very pleasant visit at Buenos Aires last winter, have been consummated. I am sure the north-bound airmail service which you have authorized in connection with our south-bound service will be the means of developing even more cordial relations between the people of our respective countries.
With assurance of high esteem, I am
Faithfully yours,
HERBERT HOOVER
