This week, President Biden, members of the Biden-Harris Cabinet, and senior administration officials fanned out across the airwaves—from Baltimore to Boise—to speak directly to the American people about the nationwide impact of the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal.
Through a series of local media interviews, regional press briefings, editorials, and travel across the country, the Biden-Harris Administration highlighted how the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal will rebuild America's roads, bridges, and rails; expand access to clean drinking water; ensure every American has access to high-speed internet; tackle the climate crisis; advance environmental justice; and drive the creation of good-paying union jobs. The legislation will also help ease inflationary pressures and strengthen supply chains by making long overdue improvements for our nation's ports, airports, rail, and roads.
