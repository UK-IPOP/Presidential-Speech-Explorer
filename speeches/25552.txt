It shows that it is possible to sweep away the customs and practices that have denied productive lives to many minority Americans. It demonstrates that there are, in truth, qualified persons from all races and regions who are available to fill posts of responsibility with dignity and competence. Our continued strength depends on our redoubled efforts to insure that the skills and potential of all our people are utilized effectively in the pursuit of our national goals.
