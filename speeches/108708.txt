Today, Romney for President announced it has raised more than $32 million so far in the primary. The campaign will report raising more than $14 million for the third quarter, and more than $18 million for the second. This total represents only primary contributions as the campaign did not raise general election funds. In 2007, Romney collected $10 million for the third quarter reporting period.
Romney for President National Finance Chairman Spencer Zwick said, "We are proud of the $32 million we have raised for the campaign so far. This is just the start of the effort to help fuel Mitt Romney's message that will defeat President Obama next November."
