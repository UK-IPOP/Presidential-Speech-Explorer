The American people have rendered their decision. I am a Democrat, and I firmly believe in the rule of the majority.
I have had a long career in elective public office. Yesterday was the twenty-first time that my name appeared on the ballot in New York State. I am happy and content, taking my place as a high private in the ranks of American citizens. I have a heart full of gratitude to all the people who worked so untiringly to promote my candidacy and to all those who cast their ballots for me.
