My dear________:
I am informed that the Supplemental Appropriation Bill, as reported from conference, contains a rider which, in effect, forbids the Atomic Energy Commission to start any specific construction project unless funds are available to complete the project; and that the amount of funds carried in the bill for the atomic energy program is less than half the amount I requested.
This rider and reduction in funds, coupled together, would mean that the Atomic Energy Commission would not be able to fulfill military requirements for atomic weapons. I cannot believe that the Congress would wish to adjourn with our national security jeopardized in this fashion.
I urgently request that this rider be eliminated before the Congress completes its action on this bill.

Sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
