IT IS MY HOPE that the Vice President, with the cooperation of relevant departments and agencies, will continue to develop practical, imaginative programs for our young people. Special intensive efforts must be made on their behalf as the young are our greatest natural resources.
These programs should take into consideration the particular problems facing young people during summer school recess. Jobs and recreation needs intensify; working mothers now have small children at home who need constant attention; and it is essential that more community facilities be made available throughout the day and into the early evening. It is my hope that under the direction of the Vice President specific answers will be found to the problems faced by our youth today, particularly those living in deprived areas.
