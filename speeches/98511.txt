ARLINGTON, VA -- Today, U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign released its latest television ad, entitled "Tiny." The ad highlights Barack Obama's belief that Iran "doesn't pose a serious threat" even though they support terrorism, are developing nuclear capabilities and repeatedly threaten to eliminate Israel. If Barack Obama doesn't consider those "serious threats" then he is dangerously unprepared to be president. The ad will air in key states.
