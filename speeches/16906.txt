I SHARE the nation's shock and grief over Chief Justice Vinson's untimely death. He was my close personal friend for many years and a statesman and jurist whom I admired deeply.
A man of exemplary character, he possessed great human understanding, appreciation of our national heritage and a keen mind. He has filled positions of great responsibility in all three branches of Government--legislative, administrative and judicial. In all of them he served with efficiency, dignity and integrity. He was an outstanding citizen whose death is a loss to America.
