IN ACCORDANCE with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, the President determines the quantities of special nuclear material to be made available for distribution at home and abroad. Such a Presidential determination of quantities of enriched uranium for peaceful uses was announced on July 3, 1963. Since that time, there has been considerable progress in plans for the increased utilization of enriched uranium in nuclear powerplants. In order to give assurances that enriched uranium can be supplied to meet these needs, I am announcing today a further increase in the quantifies of material to be made available.
I have determined, pursuant to section 41b of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, that the quantities of uranium-235 in enriched uranium to be made available are raised from 200,000 to 300,000 kilograms for domestic distribution under section 53, and from 150,000 to 250,000 kilograms for foreign distribution under section 54. These amounts have been recommended by the Atomic Energy Commission with the concurrence of the Secretaries of State and Defense. The new total of 550,000 kilograms is more than 50 percent higher than the previous total.
The material will be distributed as required over a period of years and will be subject to prudent safeguards against unauthorized use. Charges for this material will result in substantial revenues to the United States Government. As nuclear programs develop in the future, it will undoubtedly be necessary to make further determinations increasing the amounts of material to be available. The large capacity of U.S. diffusion plants for the production of enriched uranium permits them to meet both civilian and military requirements.
A discussion of the new determination is contained in the attached statement by the Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission.
