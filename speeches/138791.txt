"Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., fighting to salvage his Presidential campaign, today acknowledged 'a mistake' in his youth, when he plagiarized a law review article for a paper he wrote in his first year at law school. Mr. Biden insisted, however, that he had done nothing 'malevolent,' that he had simply misunderstood the need to cite sources carefully." (E.J. Dionne Jr., "Biden Admits Plagiarism In School But Says It Was Not 'Malevolent'," 
, 9/18/87)
"The plagiarized article, 'Tortious Acts as a Basis for Jurisdiction in Products Liability Cases,' was published in the Fordham Law Review of May 1965. Mr. Biden drew large chunks of heavy legal prose directly from it, including such sentences as: 'The trend of judicial opinion in various jurisdictions has been that the breach of an implied warranty of fitness is actionable without privity, because it is a tortious wrong upon which suit may be brought by a non-contracting party.'" (E.J. Dionne Jr., "Biden Admits Plagiarism In School But Says It Was Not 'Malevolent'," 
, 9/18/87)
"The faculty ruled that Mr. Biden would get an F in the course but would have the grade stricken when he retook it the next year. Mr. Biden eventually received a grade of 80 in the course, which, he joked today, prevented him from falling even further in his class rank. Mr. Biden, who graduated from the law school in 1968, was 76th in a class of 85." (E.J. Dionne Jr., "Biden Admits Plagiarism In School But Says It Was Not 'Malevolent',"

. SENATOR JOE BIDEN (D-DE): "Those same people who read poetry and wrote poetry and taught me how to sing verse? Is it because they didn't work hard? My ancestors, who worked in the coal mines of Northeast Pennsylvania and would come up after 12 hours and play football for four hours?" (Joe Biden, 
 IA, 8/23/87)
 "In 2004, Biden acknowledged that he did not have family members who worked in mining. 'Hell, I might be president now if it weren't for the fact I said I had an uncle who was a coal miner. Turns out I didn't have anybody in the coal mines, you know what I mean? I tried that crap — it didn't work,' he said during an interview with Jon Stewart."

 "So taken, in fact, that he lifted Mr. Kinnock's closing speech with phrases, gestures and lyrical Welsh syntax intact for his own closing speech at a debate at the Iowa State Fair on Aug. 23 - without crediting Mr. Kinnock." (Maureen Dowd, "Biden's Debate Finale: An Echo From Abroad," 
9/12/87)
"One day that August, Bill Schneider, the columnist-pundit-pilgarlic-pollster-guru, showed up with a tape of a long, lovely TV ad for Neil Kinnock, the British Labour Party leader who was running against Margaret Thatcher. Kinnock had some beautiful stuff about what the Labour Party mean to working folk. To Joe, that was exactly why he was running: to give people a platform on which to build their futures. He grabbed that tape and took it home; he inhaled the thing. It was like when Barbara Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe's song!" (Richard Ben Cramer, 
, 1992)
 "In February of 1987, Mr. Biden borrowed from a Robert Kennedy speech without attribution, later saying the remarks had been written for him; the incident initially went unreported." (Matt Flegenheimer, "Biden's First Run For President Was A Calamity. Some Missteps Still Resonate," 
 6/3/19)
 "On Sept. 17, Mr. Biden called a news conference at the Capitol to explain himself. By turns contrite and simmering, he said the law school citation issue was not 'malevolent.' He took responsibility for not knowing that he was using Mr. Kennedy's words in the February speech." (Matt Flegenheimer, "Biden's First Run For President Was A Calamity. Some Missteps Still Resonate,"

"Sometimes only a phrase is involved. In a speech to the California State Democratic Convention on Feb. 3, Mr. Biden said that 'each generation of Americans has been summoned' to a test of devotion to democracy; the same phrase was used about national loyalty by John F. Kennedy in his Presidential inaugural address in 1961." (Maureen Dowd, "Biden Is Facing Growing Debate On His Speeches,"

 "Another example concerns speeches that Senator Biden gave in Iowa in 1985 and Las Vegas in 1986, when he adopted one of Hubert Humphrey's most renowned passages without citing the source. At the Democratic National Convention in 1976, Mr. Humphrey, then a Senator from Minnesota, declared: 'The ultimate moral test of any government is the manner in which it treats three groups of its citizens: first, those who are in the dawn of life, our children; second, those who are in the shadows of life, our sick, our needy, our handicapped, and those, third, in the twilight of life, our elderly.' Senator Biden's version offered 'a nation noble enough to treat those at the dawn of life with love, those at the dusk of life with care and those who live in the shadow of life with compassion.' Senator Biden's aides cite this similarity as an instance in which Mr. Biden paid homage to a historical leader." (Maureen Dowd, "Biden Is Facing Growing Debate On His Speeches,"

 "Joe Biden's presidential campaign lifted language without credit, at times word for word, when crafting its education and climate plans, incidents the campaign acknowledged and said were inadvertent. … Biden's campaign said Tuesday that it would update his policy plans online to properly attribute the sources of information, which in the case of his environmental plan included a coal industry entity. … In the case of his education policy, Biden used a sentence word for word from an education policy publication from the group XQ Institute." (Matt Viser, Dino Gradoni, And Jeff Stein, "Joe Biden's Campaign Acknowledges Lifting Language From Other Groups For Its Policy Plans,"

VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: "Well, look, it's a—I think you're going to see from the campaign an acknowledgment of exactly how it happened and what it did, and you know, it's a— I think it's— look, they made a mistake, they corrected it, they acknowledged it and they let me know about it, and some of the language came from are people who support the plan, so anyway, thank you." (Joe Biden, 
, 6/5/19)
"This summer, former Vice President Joe Biden did the kind of thing you might do if you've repeatedly faced accusations of lifting sentences and failing to properly cite sources: He got some plagiarism-detection software. According to filings that the Federal Elections Committee released last week, Biden's presidential campaign spent $4,200 beginning on July 10 for iThenticate's plagiarism prevention services. This was roughly a month after the campaign confirmed that it had unintentionally used language from other sources in its climate and education proposals without giving due credit."
