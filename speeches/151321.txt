Greetings from St. Croix, where POTUS is spending the first full day of his post-Christmas break.
Call time has been pushed back to 1 pm AST.
POTUS has no public events on his schedule for today. Will let you know if that changes.
From the White House:
As they have done previously, the President and the First Lady are staying at the home of their friends Bill and Connie Neville.
The White House called a lid at 10:05 am AST.
Enjoy your day, folks.
