Faith leaders from denominations representing more than 100 million Americans are making the case for the passage of President Biden's agenda to secure a brighter, more equitable future for all Americans, while ensuring the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share.
Making the moral argument that now is the time for the Build Back Better Agenda, Diane Randall of the Friends Committee on National Legislation 
: "we are presented with a once-in-a-generation opportunity to drastically change the wellbeing of millions of Americans." Rev. Jim Wallis underscores the importance of this moment, 
: "What the American people, and church members across the political spectrum, need to know is that these are moral and religious issues, not just political ones: concrete help for critical child care, needed medical care, paid family leave, safe and affordable housing, access to education which children need for their futures, job opportunities for millions of families, including effective earned income tax support and, most centrally, a child tax credit that will cut child poverty in half in America." As Rev. Walter Kim, President of the National Association of Evangelicals, 
 during the Circle of Protection's visit to the White House, "We urge the passage of this legislation."
The coalition of faith leaders includes: Bread for the World, Catholic Charities USA, the National Association of Evangelicals, the Islamic Society of North America, the Episcopal Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the National African American Clergy Network, the Union for Reform Judaism, the National Council of Jewish Women, the National Latino Evangelical Coalition, the Friends Committee on National Legislation, American Muslim Health Professionals, Sojourners, Bend the Arc: Jewish Action, NETWORK, and more.
