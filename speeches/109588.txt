"Rick Santorum recently has been criticizing politicians who go to Washington and fail to stand on principle. But last month, Senator Santorum went before the country and admitted that he put principle aside to 'take one for the team' in Washington. Voters in Wisconsin and across the country have longer memories than he apparently gives them credit for." â€”Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman
 SANTORUM: "A lot of Tea Partiers, a lot of conservatives talk tough. They go out and castigate members of Congress and elected officials for compromising on their principles, for not doing what they say they were going to do. For trying just to get a deal done, trying to pass a piece of legislation and therefore sacrifice and walk away from their principles in order to win." (Rick Santorum, Remarks in Janesville, WI, 3/27/12)
 SANTORUM: "How many times have you said you're sick and tired of politicians going to Washington, D.C. and not standing up for their principles? How many times have you said that in the last umpteen years?" (Rick Santorum, Remarks in Milwaukee, WI, 3/24/12)
 SANTORUM: "I supported No Child Left Behind. ... I have to admit, I voted for that. It was against the principles I believed in, but, you know, when you're part of the team, sometimes you take one for the team, for the leader, and I made a mistake. You know, politics is a team sport, folks." (GOP Presidential Debate, 2/22/12)
