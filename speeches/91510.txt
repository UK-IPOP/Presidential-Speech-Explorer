NEW HAMPTON, IA -- Governor Bill Richardson released the following statement today regarding the second anniversary of the Hurricane Katrina tragedy:
"The administration has failed to keep its promise to the residents of New Orleans and the American people. Katrina now stands as a monument to incompetence and arrogance. The citizens of this great country expect and deserve more from their President and their government. We need bold, dramatic change to ensure this never happens again.
"I have proposed a comprehensive plan to create an emergency response structure, able to respond immediately and effectively, that will restore the nation's confidence and peace of mind:
"Two years ago, the President vowed to rebuild the city better than it was before and promised to restore our broken faith in his leadership. Like so many other promises he has made, this too was just empty words.
"New Orleans is still suffering and is far from being rebuilt. Many residents have not returned. The resilient people of New Orleans have put life back in the city, but they have done it mostly on their own.
"As a nation, we are no better prepared now to handle a disaster like Katrina than we were then. Presidential leadership is nowhere to be found.
"We need to change course.
"Today, let us take a moment to remember and pray for the victims of this tragedy. In their name, let us renew our promise to rebuild New Orleans, and together, rebuild the promise of America."
