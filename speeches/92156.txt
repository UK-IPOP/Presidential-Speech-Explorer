SANTA FE, NM -- In yesterday's DNC/ABC Democratic Presidential debate in Iowa, Governor Bill Richardson clearly showed the differences that make him the only candidate who offers both unmatched experience and the ability to bring about the change America needs to move forward. The biggest and most important difference among the candidates is their individual plans to end the war in Iraq. Governor Richardson showed he has the strongest, most sensible plan- get all US troops out of Iraq with no residual forces left behind, then use intense diplomacy to stabilize Iraq and calm the region. He also received an enthusiastic ovation from the studio audience when he stressed the importance of education reform and outlined his one-point plan for No Child Left Behind: "Scrap it."
National media reporting and commenting on the debate was highly complimentary of Governor Richardson's performance. A few examples:
Chris Cillizza of the Washington Post's The Fix said that Governor Richardson and Senator Obama were the two winners of the debate.
David Yepsen of the Des Moines Register -- one of the two moderators of the debate -- agreed that Governor Richardson was a winner of the debate. Yepsen called this debate Richardson's "best performance" and said that "Richardson has been moving up in polls in Iowa, and Sunday's performance should help."
Rick Klein of ABC's The Note concurred that this was Governor Richardson's "strongest" debate performance. In his liveblog of the debate, he wrote: "Richardson is cooking at this debate -- he is coming across really, really well."
