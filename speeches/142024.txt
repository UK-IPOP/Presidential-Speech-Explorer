. Are you thinking of going to the border?
 At some point, I will. Yes.
Do you want to see firsthand what's going on in those facilities?
 I know what's going on in those facilities.
 And do you——
Mr. President, why do you think the message to the migrants, telling them to stay home and don't come now—why do you think that hasn't resonated yet? What more can be done, sir?
 A lot more. We're in the process of doing it now, including making sure that we reestablish what existed before, which was they can stay in place and make their case from their home country.
Thank you.
And when will you allow the media into those facilities?
