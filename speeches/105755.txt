Mitt Romney today announced additional legislative endorsements in Florida.
"I am honored to receive the endorsements of so many great legislators in the Sunshine State," said Mitt Romney. "I look forward to working with these leaders to put Floridians and all Americans back to work, turn around the economy and make Barack Obama a one-term president."
"Mitt Romney has the experience to put our financial house back in order," said State Senator JD Alexander. "While he was governor, he balanced the budget without raising taxes and was a job creator. His experience in both business and government is exactly what we need to get the economy turned around."
