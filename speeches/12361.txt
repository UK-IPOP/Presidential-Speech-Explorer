 Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence and third President of the United States, was the advocate of great causes and high ideals of human freedom—principles adopted as fundamental by the American people; and
 Thomas Jefferson as lawyer, statesman, philosopher, scientist, farmer, and architect lived a life of such rich diversity that it encompassed the full scope of the knowledge of his time, and—of happy significance to his country—knew how to carry theory into practice, and from youth to a fine old age exemplified in all of his work the principle that the true evidence of life is growth; and
 Public Resolution No. 60, 75th Congress, approved August 16, 1937, provides:
That the President of the United States of America is authorized and directed to issue a proclamation calling upon officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on April 13 of each year, and inviting the people of the United States to observe the day in schools and churches, or other suitable places, with appropriate ceremonies in commemoration of the birth of Thomas Jefferson:
, President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on April 13, 1938, and on April 13 of each succeeding year, and do invite the people of the United States to observe the day in schools, churches, and other suitable places, with appropriate ceremonies in commemoration of the birth of Thomas Jefferson.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 21st day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-second.
FRANKLIN D ROOSEVELT
