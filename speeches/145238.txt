Yesterday, President Biden announced his intent to nominate Judge Kentanji Brown Jackson, one of our nation's brightest legal minds, as Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. President Biden sought a candidate with exceptional credentials, unimpeachable character, and unwavering dedication to the rule of law. Judge Jackson formerly clerked for Justice Breyer, and has broad experience across the legal profession – as a federal appellate judge, a federal district court judge, a member of the U.S. Sentencing Commission, an attorney in private practice, and as a federal public defender. She has been confirmed by the Senate on a bipartisan basis three times – most recently last year for her current seat. If confirmed, Jackson will be the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court.
A broad range of elected leaders in the Senate and House of Representatives issued statements applauding her qualifications and acknowledging her historic nomination.
"With her exceptional qualifications and record of evenhandedness, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson will be a Justice who will uphold the constitution and protect the rights of all Americans, including the voiceless and vulnerable. A true public servant and model jurist, Judge Jackson has demonstrated a commitment to America's foundational principles of freedom, equality, and the rule of law throughout her career. As a clerk for Justice Stephen Breyer, an assistant federal public defender, a federal district court judge, and most recently as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, Judge Jackson has shown brilliance, thoughtfulness, a willingness to collaborate, and a dedication to applying the law impartially. The historic nomination of Judge Jackson is an important step toward ensuring the Supreme Court reflects the nation as a whole. As the first Black woman Supreme Court Justice in the Court's 232-year-history, she will inspire countless future generations of young Americans. Senate Democrats spent the past year working with President Biden to shape a federal judicial system that fully represents America and we will continue that trend by confirming Judge Jackson to the Supreme Court. I commend President Biden on undertaking a thoughtful, deliberate selection process for the next Supreme Court Justice. Once the President sends Judge Jackson's nomination to the Senate, Senate Democrats will work to ensure a fair, timely, and expeditious process – fair to the nominee, to the Senate, and to the American public. Under Chairman Durbin's leadership, Judge Jackson will receive a prompt hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee in the coming weeks. After the Judiciary Committee finishes their work I will ask the Senate to move immediately to confirm her to the Supreme Court. I have no doubt that Judge Jackson would make an outstanding Supreme Court Justice. Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson has been confirmed by the United States Senate on a bipartisan basis three times and I expect she will again earn bipartisan support in the Senate." [

"From a strong list of prospective candidates, President Biden has chosen an extraordinary nominee in D.C. Circuit Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. To be the first to make history in our nation you need to have an exceptional life story. Judge Jackson's achievements are well known to the Senate Judiciary Committee as we approved her to the D.C. Circuit less than a year ago with bipartisan support. We will begin immediately to move forward on her nomination with the careful, fair, and professional approach she and America are entitled to." [
, 2/25/22]
 "Judge Jackson is an extraordinary nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court and the right choice for this historic moment in our country. From her clerkship at the Supreme Court, to her work as a public defender, to her distinguished service on the D.C. District Court and Circuit Court, Judge Jackson's impressive background of public service makes her an outstanding nominee. Her experience will inform her work as a thoughtful judge with an understanding of the lives of the American people. Her history of standing up for justice, democracy, and equal rights for all Americans is exactly what our country needs right now. Both Republicans and Democrats have already voted for her for past judicial positions, which only affirms her qualifications, character, and integrity. I know Judge Jackson will be an excellent Supreme Court Justice. What an exciting time for our country." [Statement, 2/25/22]
 "The historic nomination of Judge Jackson to serve on the Supreme Court is a barrier-breaking moment in American history. Judge Jackson is a well-respected jurist whose qualifications and wide-ranging legal experience will undoubtedly serve our nation well. The rulings of our nation's highest court have a direct and consequential impact on the lives of Michiganders, including women's reproductive rights, workers' rights, environmental protections and voting rights. I applaud President Biden for nominating Judge Jackson, who is exceptionally well-qualified and look forward to a prompt confirmation process to ensure the Supreme Court further reflects the diversity of America."

I look forward to meeting with Judge Jackson and discussing her nomination." [Statement, 2/25/22]
: "Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is indisputably well qualified to serve on the Supreme Court. She currently serves as a federal appellate judge on the D.C. Circuit Court and before that spent eight years as a federal district judge on the D.C. District Court. This is a historic nomination. Judge Jackson is the first Black woman to be nominated to the Supreme Court and she embodies President Biden's commitment to ensuring that the federal judiciary is representative of America as a whole. If confirmed, she would become the first former federal public defender to serve on the Supreme Court. She has been confirmed by the Senate three times, as recently as last year with bipartisan support. I look forward to productive hearings before the Judiciary Committee soon." [

 "@POTUS has made an exceptional choice by nominating Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, an outstanding jurist, to #SCOTUS. The Supreme Court has never before benefitted from the voice and perspective of a Black woman. This nomination is not only historic — it is long overdue." [
, 2/25/22]
"This historic nomination is truly thrilling. Judge Jackson has an exceptional record of personal accomplishment and character with unquestionable qualifications as a dynamic, brilliant, jurist. She is a star – an example of the best of America. Like her mentor Justice Breyer, she is grounded in the real-world with a strong sense of how legal abstractions dramatically impact everyday Americans. As Justice Breyer said about her, she has a unique combination of commonsense and thoughtfulness. When we met earlier this month, I urged President Biden to nominate a Black woman with powerful intellect and profound integrity – and he has more than met that goal. I look forward to discussing her qualifications with colleagues on both sides of the aisle, as well as meeting with Judge Jackson and spending some time reviewing her record ahead of our Committee's confirmation hearings." [Statement, 2/25/22]
"Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is an impressive and historic choice. Her experience as a public defender and a judge on both the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit is excellent preparation for the Supreme Court. I appreciate Judge Jackson's reputation for independent thinking and fair-minded rulings, which is one of many reasons the Senate confirmed her to the D.C. Circuit on a bipartisan basis. "I look forward to meeting Judge Jackson and reviewing her record more closely in the weeks ahead. At a time of partisan division and public distrust in our institutions, this confirmation process is an opportunity for the Senate to reinforce the American people's confidence in the rule of law and our constitutional checks and balances."

"President Biden has made an excellent choice with his nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. She is an historic pick with an outstanding record of service that makes her as qualified as any Supreme Court nominee in recent memory. In his decades on the Court, Justice Breyer has not only brought a keen legal mind but an ability to engage and persuade his colleagues in ways that built majorities that could deliver lasting opinions. With this choice, I am optimistic President Biden has selected someone who will be able to serve that same role on the Court. President Biden has done his job, and now it is time for the Senate to do ours. I have been reading into Judge Jackson's record, and I look forward to meeting with her soon and working with my colleagues on @JudiciaryDems to ensure a smooth, swift confirmation process." [

Judge Jackson has dedicated her career to justice, bringing the unique perspective of a former public defender to the bench. With this historic nomination of Judge Brown, President Biden has done much more than fulfill a campaign promise. He has recognized and given voice to millions of Black women who for more than two centuries have never been represented on the nation's highest court. Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson will bring to the Supreme Court a needed perspective that has been sorely lacking from its jurisprudence.

The federal judiciary can and should reflect the diversity that is at the heart of our nation. Only then do we move closer to achieving a more perfect union. Judge Brown Jackson has already demonstrated intellect and impartiality on both the D.C. District Court and the D.C. Circuit Court. The bipartisan votes with which she was confirmed to both these seats is a credit to the record she has shown since first being confirmed by the Senate — unanimously — in 2013. Her record in both the private and public sectors brings a diversity of legal experience that provides informed jurisprudence. This is the kind of nominee we should all expect to our nation's highest court. The President has done his job, nominating a highly qualified, experienced judge for elevation to the Supreme Court. The Senate must now do its job — free of politics and political vitriol — to fairly and objectively evaluate this nominee. We have a true opportunity, after careful review, to provide our advice and consent on this historic nominee. I believe Judge Jackson's nomination is one that can unite the Senate in sending a signal to the American people that our courts should not and must not be partisan arms of our government. I look forward to this historic confirmation process." [
