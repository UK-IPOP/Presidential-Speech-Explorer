 "For the latest time since losing his bid for the GOP presidential nomination two years ago, Senate Commerce ranking member John McCain, R-Ariz., has teamed up with a prominent Democrat on legislation bitterly opposed by the Bush administration. This time, the issue is higher mileage standards for automobiles--and his partner is Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass. McCain and Kerry Thursday agreed to introduce legislation that would increase fuel efficiency standards to 36 miles per gallon by 2015." ("McCain Again Teams Up With Dems,"

 "Sen. John McCain didn't expect an enthusiastic response this morning when he touted the need for higher fuel standards to the Detroit Economic Club. No surprise, the crowd didn't exactly embrace the idea. Asked how raising Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards was 'different than raising taxes,' McCain acknowledged he didn't think his proposal would be very popular. 'I know, I said it's a tough issue. CAFE standards have to be improved. There's too much pollution in the environment, there's too much dependency on foreign oil and we're going to have to take a number of steps,' McCain told the crowd. He finished his answer to dead silence." (Amy Schatz, "McCain Urges Higher CAFE Standards – In Motor City,"

 "Major automakers characterize the Kerry-McCain plan as a reckless attempt to legislate technology that could curtail sales of their most profitable SUVs and pickups. General Motors Corp. says that as many as 100,000 jobs would be lost." (Jeff Plungis, "Automakers Support Alternate CAFE Proposal,"

Vice Chairman Bob Lutz says a proposal for higher fuel-economy standards that's gaining popularity in Washington would 'effectively hand the truck and SUV market over to the imports, particularly the Japanese.'"

 "A CAFE increase "would limit GM's ability to build as many larger vehicles as its customers may demand. Larger SUVs and pickups are a key part of GM's plan to improve profits in North America." (Justin Hyde, "GM Exec: Fuel Rules Could Doom U.S. Market For Trucks,"

 Rogers: "If you are a full-line vehicle manufacturer and you have to go from an average of 24 mpg across the entire fleet of vehicles sold to 36 mpg – a 50 percent increase – in a short period of time by auto industry standards, say 10 years, it would require simultaneously redesigning all vehicles, all engines and all powertrains. Not even GM has the resources to begin that kind of work. The cost would be astronomical and in my opinion would bring this nation to its knees from an economic perspective."

 "McCain, together with Democrat John Kerry, were initial co-sponsors of the 35 mpg (so-called CAFE) mandate that just passed Congress -- legislation that economists predict will cost the domestic auto industry $85 billion over a decade and impact thousands of jobs."

 "McCain questioned the auto industry's credibility, citing past opposition to federal regulations requiring seat belts, greater fuel economy and air bags. 'Whatever it is, they've said it was going to be the end of the auto industry,' McCain said. 'It hasn't happened.'" (Jeff Plungis, "Plan To Raise Fuel Rules Fails,"

 "McCain blasted the automakers for resisting the changes. 'The auto industry has resisted every single change in safety and efficiency for over 40 years,' he said. 'At one time they were against seat belts. At one time they were against air bags.'" (Deirdre Shesgreen, "Senate Applies Brakes To Plan Calling For Higher Fuel Efficiency Standards,"
