Today in Washington, D.C., Mitt Romney delivered a speech on education and presented his plan for reform that will provide a chance for every child. Romney criticized President Obama's preference for increased spending over genuine reform, and emphasized the unproductive role that teachers' unions have played for decades.
"I believe the President must be troubled by the lack of progress since he took office. Most likely, he would have liked to do more," said Romney. "But President Obama has been unable to stand up to union bosses, and unwilling to stand up for kids."
Romney outlined a vision for restoring the promise of America's education system and guaranteeing every student the opportunity to succeed. For the nation's K-12 schools, his policies will provide more choices for parents, further emphasize responsibility for results, and place a quality teacher in every classroom. For higher education, Romney will ensure that all Americans have affordable options to prepare them for successful careers.
"As president, I will pursue bold policy changes that will restore the promise of our nation's education system," said Romney. "Dramatically expanding parental choice, making schools responsible for results by giving parents access to clear and instructive information, and attracting and rewarding our best teachers â€” these changes can help ensure that every parent has a choice and every child has a chance."
Romney presented the details of his plan:
As president, Mitt Romney will pursue genuine education reform that puts the interests of parents and students ahead of special interests and provides a chance for every child. He will take the unprecedented step of tying federal funds directly to dramatic reforms that expand parental choice, invest in innovation, and reward teachers for their results instead of their tenure. These policies will equip state leaders to achieve the change that can only come from commitment and action at the local level. He will also ensure that students have diverse and affordable options for higher education to give them the skills they need to succeed after graduation and that, when they graduate, they can find jobs that provide a rewarding return on their educational investment.
Giving students trapped in bad schools a genuine alternative requires four things: (1) such alternatives must exist, (2) parents must receive clear information about the performance of their current school and of the alternatives, (3) students must be allowed to move to a new school, and (4) students must bring funding with them so that new schools can afford to serve them. Romney's reforms achieve each of these objectives:
Currently, there is little easily-available data for parents about their children's schools. Providing better information for parents will empower them to hold districts and states responsible for results and, when combined with increased parental choice, give them more control over their children's education. Romney's reforms will improve transparency and give parents the information they need:
A school is only as strong as its teachers, but the most promising teachers often find it difficult to reach the classroom door or receive recognition for their efforts once inside. Romney's reforms smooth the path for talented individuals to join the profession and shape the next generation.
America's traditional community and four-year colleges are the heart of our nation's higher education system. However, a flood of federal dollars is driving up tuition and burdening too many young Americans with substantial debt and too few opportunities. Meanwhile, other models of advanced skills training are becoming ever more important to success in the American economy, and new educational institutions will be required to fill those roles. Romney's reforms spur the access, affordability, innovation, and transparency needed to address all of these challenges:
. Encourage market entry by innovative new education models, emphasize skill attainment instead of time spent in the classroom, and support research and development. Repeal confusing and unnecessary regulations that primarily serve to drive costs higher, and replace them with common-sense reforms that ensure appropriate student outcomes.
