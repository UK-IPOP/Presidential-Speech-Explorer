The Rudy Giuliani Presidential Committee today announced its Women for Rudy leadership team. Led by Oklahoma's Terry Neese, the coalition was announced at a rally with Mayor Giuliani in Orlando. Joining the Mayor at the rally were Congresswoman Mary Bono Mack (R – CA) and former Congresswoman Susan Molinari (R – NY).
"Mayor Giuliani has campaigned tirelessly across the country, sharing his optimistic vision for the future of our great country," said Neese, who joined Rudy at a rally in Boca Raton, FL, on Thursday. "The Women for Rudy coalition has echoed his message, and I'm proud to lead this grassroots movement. Lower taxes and national security are issues all Americans can rally around."
"Mayor Giuliani is running a strong grassroots campaign across the country and the incredible organization and assistance of Women for Rudy is invaluable," said Rick Wiley, Giuliani's Deputy National Political Director.
