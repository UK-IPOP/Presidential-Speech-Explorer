I SHALL be pleased to act as an honorary referee to the field games between the visiting teams of Oxford and Cambridge and the American teams from Princeton and, Cornell, and only regret that my duties here will not permit me to be present and witness them in person.
The character building influence of clean sports is such that they deserve every encouragement, and besides that, I should have been glad of the opportunity to welcome these fine young men visiting our shores.
