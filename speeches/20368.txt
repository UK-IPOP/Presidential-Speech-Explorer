TOMORROW MORNING Secretary Dillon leads an American delegation to the conference at Montevideo. This conference is of vital importance to this hemisphere. Our hopes go with Secretary Dillon, and our strong support.
I consider this conference to be the most important international conference which has been held since this administration assumed responsibility on January 20th.
If it were not that we were deeply involved and heavily committed in the legislation which is now being considered by the Congress on mutual security, legislation which is an integral part of the whole program for this hemisphere, I would be attending the conference myself.
In Secretary Dillon we have selected a man who has participated in related negotiations before. He leads a high-level conference, and it is my great hope that this conference will be a success, and it will begin a new period in the hemisphere in the development of a better life for our people. So that we wish him every success.
