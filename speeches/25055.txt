BERNARD BARUCH was in the robust tradition of the philosopher-politician: one who thought and cared mightily about the course of his country but who did not shrink from actively doing what needed to be done to keep his country on course.
He loved his Nation and he lived for his Nation and that was enough to enroll him in an aristocracy of humanity.
