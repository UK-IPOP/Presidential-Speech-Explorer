At a young age, I felt drawn to math and science. The idea of innovation and its impact on our lives truly inspired me. I am also blessed with several engineers in the family, including my father, who helped show me the power of engineering.

For Louisiana, and the United States to be competitive in a global economy, our children must have a solid foundation in math and science. Vital industries to our economy, our security and our wellbeing such as defense, medical, pharmaceutical and agriculture all need a new generation of thinkers to stay on the cutting edge.

Like anything, you need to make it fun. One of the things we have really tried to do with the Jindal Foundation is to encourage hands on learning and bringing interactive tools into as many Louisiana classrooms as possible. You also need to make STEM/STEAM relatable. That helps show how important it is. We have welcomed engineers from NASA, The Dow Chemical Company, LSU and other great companies to help us give students hands-on demonstrations which help them to realize that math and science is all around them. It's exciting.

I created the Supriya Jindal Foundation for Louisiana's Children to harness the power of technology in Louisiana classrooms, to emphasize the importance of science and math, and to help develop the Louisiana workforce of tomorrow.
Through the generosity of many wonderful partners, the Foundation has raised over $2.3 million to positively impact over 1,200 classrooms across Louisiana, brought twenty-first century learning tools into classrooms, encouraged students to pursue careers in math and science, promoted healthy lifestyles, donated school supplies to children affected by the Oil Spill, inspired a love for reading and offered new parents guidance regarding the development of their young child. With these initiatives, the Foundation was able to directly impact almost 300,000 people!
