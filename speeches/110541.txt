He has stood tall for life, fiscal responsibility, entitlement reform, and our national security. National conservative leaders from Governor Mike Huckabee to Rush Limbaugh to Glenn Beck have proudly acknowledged Rick's strong conservative leadership for America. Now Americans from across the country are seeing that Rick Santorum is the right man, at the right time to lead our nation forward."
