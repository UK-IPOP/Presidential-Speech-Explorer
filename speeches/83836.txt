Last year at Evian we agreed "to support the development of cleaner, sustainable and more efficient technologies." We reaffirm our conviction that "cooperative scientific research on transformation technologies offers potential to improve public health by cutting pollution and reduce greenhouse gas emission to address the challenge of global climate change."
As we continue to implement the G8 Action Plan on Science and Technology for Sustainable Development adopted at Evian, we commit to launching the Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle ("3R") Initiative to encourage more efficient use of resources and materials. The initiative will be formally launched in the coming year at a ministerial meeting in Japan.
We will launch the Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle ("3R") Initiative at a Ministerial Conference in spring 2005 hosted by the Government of Japan. In cooperation with relevant international organizations such as the OECD, we will seek through this initiative to:
In the period since Evian our actions taken to implement the Evian S&T Action Plan include:
