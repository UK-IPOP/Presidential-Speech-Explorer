Mr. President, Mr. Foreign Minister, and gentlemen:
As you, Mr. President, complete your official visit here, I want you to know first how much we have enjoyed knowing you and your family personally and how much we have profited from the opportunity of exchanging views with you, not only on the bilateral matters which we have discussed and on which we have made considerable progress, I believe--as I understand you will cover some of those matters in your own statements, both here and when you return--but also in terms of the broader aspects of the policies of the United States in the American Hemisphere.
You are the first visitor, as we have pointed out, from Latin America during this new administration. We recognize the urgency of this problem. We recognize the need for new ideas. We recognize the need for new programs, and we want those new ideas and those new programs to be ones that we share together in which we not just talk, but in which we listen and in which we learn.
In our wide ranging discussions, not only of our bilateral problems, but in a broader sense, of the problems of the hemisphere, I cannot think of any leader in Latin America who could have contributed more to our own thinking.
I think your visit will mark a major step forward in the development of new policies by the United States in its relationship with our friends in Latin America. And I think that next week at the Economic Conference [Inter-American Economic and Social Conference] that is being held in Trinidad we will see some of the first fruits of those new directions and certainly the credit for these new departures-they will be modest to begin with, but the promise for the future will be very great--the credit will go to you and to this visit. Without your visit we might not have moved as fast as we should have.
