 In the meantime, since the start of 2008, Congress has been on recess almost as many days as they have been in session.
 The President's proposed bill would increase access to FHA-insured loans and expand FHA's authority to price insurance fairly, with risk-based premiums.
 Since 
 was announced, FHA has helped more than 140,000 families stay in their homes by refinancing about $20 billion worth of mortgages. By the year's end, this program is expected to have helped a total of nearly 300,000 homeowners.
 This creates a three-year window for homeowners to refinance and pay no Federal taxes on any debt forgiveness.
 President Bush recognized the initial signs of slowdown and acted decisively. Congress responded to the President's call for action, and in February the President signed a bipartisan economic growth package that puts more than $150 billion back in the hands of families and businesses.
 Under current law, tax-exempt bonds are only for first-time homebuyers and cannot be issued for refinancing.
 Congress needs to pass legislation that strengthens the independent regulator of the GSEs and ensures their focus on the housing mission.
 If Congress allows the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to expire, 116 million taxpayers will see their taxes go up by $1,800 on average, and we will see an end to many of the measures that have helped our economy grow â€“ including the 10 percent individual income tax bracket, reductions in the marriage penalty, the expansion of the child tax credit, and reduced rates on regular income, capital gains, and dividends.
