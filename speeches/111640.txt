"For three and a half years, President Obama has repeatedly demonstrated he doesn't have what it takes to fix our economy — and yesterday's disappointing economic news only further confirmed that fact. Home sales are down and millions of middle-class families are still struggling. It's unacceptable, and Americans deserve a new direction and new president." —Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 "New single-family home sales in June fell by the most in more than a year and prices resumed their downward trend, suggesting a setback for the budding housing market recovery. The Commerce Department said on Wednesday sales tumbled 8.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted 350,000-unit annual rate, the lowest rate in five months. The percent decline was the largest since February 2011." (Lucia Mutikani, "New Home Sales Post Biggest Drop In Over One Year,"

 "Americans bought fewer new homes in June after sales jumped to a two-year high in May. The steep decline suggests a weaker job market and slower growth could make the housing recovery uneven. The Commerce Department said Wednesday that sales of new homes fell 8.4 percent last month from May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 350,000. That's the biggest drop since February 2011."

 "These latest numbers fly in the face of rising home builder optimism and a huge run on the stocks of the public builders. Some analysts, however, have been warning that this recovery is fragile at best, given other factors in the economy, specifically lackluster job growth and poor consumer sentiment."

 "Forty-four percent (44%) of Americans now say it's at least somewhat likely that the United States will enter a 1930's-like economic depression in the next few years. Just as many (42%) see this scenario as unlikely. These findings include 20% who say an economic depression is Very Likely in the near future but only seven percent (7%) who say it's Not At All Likely to happen. Belief in the possibility of a depression similar to one in the 1930s is at its highest level this year but is below results measured in 2011."
