Air Force One wheels down at Luke Air Base in Arizona at 12:26 pm
President Biden, wearing aviator sunglasses on a mild, sunny day here in Arizona, deplaned at 12:35 p.m. local at Luke Air Force Base in Maricopa County, Arizona. He shook hands with Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey and the two spoke out of earshot from the pool.

Chief Master Sergeant Catherine Erin Buchanan, Command Chief, 944th Fighter Wing.
Mr. Biden was followed by Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, who greeted Mr. Ducey warmly, and members of the Arizona congressional delegation who exchanged hellos. Sen. Mark Kelly, wearing a Navy ballcap, was joined by his spouse, former Rep. Gabby Giffords.
At 12:41 p.m. the motorcade was rolling for the TSMC plant in Phoenix.
President Biden's motorcade arrived at the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. site in Phoenix at 1:25 p.m. after an uneventful, roughly 45-minute drive along a highway dotted by green cacti. Small, scattered groups of pro-Trump and pro-Biden groups gathered a few miles from the site.
One of the plant's buildings is adorned with massive U.S. and Arizona flags, along with a banner that reads, "A Future Made in America: Phoenix, Arizona."
The construction project is massive, with a series of blue, red and gold cranes stretched out across the sprawling site. (We are told that one of the crane's is the world's largest."
The president will be taking a tour of the chip plant shortly.
President Biden started his tour of the TSMC site at 1:43 p.m., joined by CC Wei, CEO of TSMC, Dr. Mark Liu, chairman of TSMC, and Aaron Butler, President of the Arizona Building and Construction Trades Council.
"Hey guys, how are you?" Mr. Biden said to a group of workers, many who were wearing white hard hats and yellow reflective vests. They were all standing inside a cavernous facility, where hard-hat wearing workers could be spotted in the distance working on a chip cleanroom. The group included Dieuanh Phan, the manufacturing manager of TSMC, and members of UA Pipefitters Local 469.
It was difficult to hear the president at times inside the building, but he thanked the workers and asked how many people were employed at the site. It's an active construction site here and your pooler spotted a light gray film of dust on the bottom of the president's black loafers.
The president then walked over to a second site, which offered a vista of a massive red crane, which the pool was told was one of the largest in the world. "Beautiful," the president said, marveling at the site. At one point, he appeared to speak to one of the crane operators. The group included Lacey Sue Suastegui, senior project manager of TSMC, and business agents and members of UA Pipefitters Local 469. He wrapped up his tour at 1:53 p.m.
Prior to the president's arrival, your pooler spotted Apple CEO Tim Cook chatting with NEC Director Brian Deese, while Gov. Doug Ducey was in conversation with Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Sen. Mark Kelly.
Earlier in the day, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. announced plans to build a second semiconductor factory at the site and increase its investment there to $40 billion.
TSMC, the world's largest contract-chip maker, had previously announced at $12 billion investment plan, including its first factory in Arizona that the president will be touring. The facility will produce 4-and-5 nanometer chips.
Construction on the second factory at the site is slated to begin in the coming year and the company said production would begin in 2026.
The president's remarks are coming up shortly and they will be carried at

President Biden began his remarks at the TSMC site at 2:16 p.m.

Air Force One was wheels down at Joint Base Andrews at 9:48 p.m. ET. There were no visitors to the press cabin, where the TVs aired CNN's coverage of the Senate runoff election in Georgia. By the time of our arrival, no winner had been declared in the race by the AP and networks.
We have light rainfall and blustery conditions here at Andrews, with a temperature of 50 degrees F.
President Biden walked down the staircase of AF1 at 10:03 pm.
Asked for his reaction to the Senate race, he shouted to the pool, "We're going to win. We're going to win Georgia." He then boarded the Beast.
We have a bad weather call so Mr. Biden will be motorcading back to the White House.
Handing off to the in-town pool.
Good night.
