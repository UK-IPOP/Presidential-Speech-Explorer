My dear Judge Robinson:
I have your letter of January 8th tendering your resignation as a member of the Federal Radio Commission. I must, of course, accept your wish in the matter. You have performed a real public service and I wish to express my personal appreciation, to which I know I may add the appreciation of many thousands of your friends and countrymen.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Hon. Ira E. Robinson, Federal Radio Commission, Washington, D.C.]
