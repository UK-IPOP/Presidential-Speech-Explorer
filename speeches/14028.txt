 an increased supply of food is vitally needed to promote peace and happiness in the postwar world; and
 farm accidents rob the nation of thousands of lives and millions of dollars worth of food and other property each year; and
 experience in previous observances of National Farm Safety Week has clearly shown the necessity and benefits of a coordinated and constant educational farm-safety program:
 President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the Nation to observe the week commencing July 21, 1946, as National Farm Safety Week.
And I request all persons and organizations concerned with agriculture and farm life to do everything in their power to discover and publish the facts about farm accidents, and to develop practical safety programs which farm people everywhere can translate into direct action against hazards which daily threaten their lives and happiness. As a start, I specifically suggest that the farm people of the country observe National Farm Safety Week by resolving to eliminate at least one hazard a day until their farms are as safe as they can possibly make them.
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 27th day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventieth.

HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
DEAN ACHESON,

Acting Secretary of State.
