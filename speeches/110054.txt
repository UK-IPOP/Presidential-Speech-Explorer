Today, the Administration officially opened two new national, multi-agency centers to improve how the U.S. Government administers its export control system. This is a significant step forward in the President's Export Control Reform Initiative of implementing common sense reforms to streamline and improve the nation's export control system.


In support of the E2C2 and the ITU, the Director of National Intelligence has designated the Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive as the entity responsible for coordinating export control issues involving the Intelligence Community. This designation is another significant process improvement for more seamless and comprehensive access to intelligence that strengthens our export control system's protection of U.S. national security.

These multi-agency centers are changing the way the Executive Branch does business by implementing a more fully coordinated and harmonized approach that facilitates secure trade. Such an approach will better protect military critical technologies from being transferred to countries or entities of national security and proliferation concern. It will also strengthen the U.S. defense industrial base by helping U.S. exporters to be more competitive and reliable suppliers. These steps are improving how the U.S. Government utilizes its existing resources to ensure that our export control system meets our national security and foreign policy objectives.
