In compliance with the provisions of the act of March 3, 1915, establishing the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, I submit herewith the eleventh annual report of the committee for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1925.

The statement of the present status of aviation, as outlined in Part V of the committee's report, should dispel the impression that America is lagging in the technical development of aircraft for military purposes. Scientific research on the fundamental problems of flight and the collection of results of research conducted in other progressive nations are official duties of the committee. Their opinion that America is at least abreast of other nations in the technical development of aircraft is commended to the Congress as the most authoritative that can be had. I agree with the committee that substantial progress in aeronautics is dependent largely upon scientific research. I believe that the work of the committee is the most fundamental activity of the Government in connection with the development of aeronautics and that its continuance is essential if America is to maintain its present advanced position in aircraft development.

The condition of the aircraft industry and the prospects for the development of commercial aviation on a sound basis have materially improved during the past year. To encourage the development of commercial aviation I wish especially to indorse the recommendation of the committee for the creation of a bureau of air navigation in the Department of Commerce.
