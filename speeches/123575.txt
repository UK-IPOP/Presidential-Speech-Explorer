We have good people in this race. We have good people running for president. And I thank them today for their sacrifice and their willingness to serve to honor this great country and to make her better. But my job was to find the person I thought could do it the best. So I wanted somebody with fight. I wanted somebody with passion. I wanted somebody that had conviction to do the right thing, but I wanted somebody humble enough that remembers that you work for all the people. I wanted somebody that was going to go and show my parents that the best decision they ever made for their children was coming to America.

We say that every day is a great day in South Carolina. Ladies and gentlemen, if we elect Marco Rubio, every day will be a great day in America!
