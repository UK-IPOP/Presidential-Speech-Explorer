THE UNTIMELY death of Dorothy Elston Kabis is a blow not only to her friends and associates, but to the country in whose service she lived and died.
Her dedication to good government was unwavering, her organizational talents unsurpassed, her sense of humor unfailing. The eloquence, perseverance and tireless devotion of "Dottie" Kabis to the important causes she espoused gave her immeasurable influence in countless areas of national endeavor.
She provided the modern American woman a stirring example around which to build her life, and proved to all of us the unlimited potential for achievement by women in our society.
The Republican Party is proud to claim her. But we are even prouder that she shared her talents with the nation. As we who worked with her and knew her best now memorialize the enduring good she did, we also set the tone for what will be a nation's lasting tribute. In our hearts, as in the hearts of her friends across the country, there will always be a special place for Dorothy Elston Kabis.
