Dear Mr. Secretary:
Your third annual report on the Rural Development Program to assist small and low-income farmers is an impressive record of achievement.
I note with particular interest the continued expansion of the program to new areas of need, and its growing impact on private and government activities in rural areas throughout the Nation.
As you clearly indicate in the state-by-state summary accompanying this report, the Rural Development Program has resulted in more opportunities through the introduction of new farm crops, expanded and more efficient farm marketing, off-farm jobs in newly established or enlarged rural industries, and vocational guidance and training.
Notable in the program has been the imaginative, vigorous leadership provided by state and local leaders in the participating states. Farm, business, civic, educational and church leaders, assisted by government agencies, are contributing their time, skills and resources to this vital work.
The Rural Development Program is providing a framework for strengthening the Nation's agriculture on a long-term basis. It can help thousands of rural communities all across the land meet the challenge of the future.

Such a program deserves the awareness and support of all Americans.

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
