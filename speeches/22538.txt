Ladies and gentlemen:
We are delighted to have the guests with us that we have today. First, Mr. Thomas Martin. While a captive, Mr. Martin wrote his wife that he looked forward to spending the evening in a Lima, Peru, night club.
I hope my invitation hasn't interfered with you, Mr. Martin, and I hope you enjoy an evening in Washington or New York. Will you stand up and meet the press.
Next, Mr. Michael Kristula and Bernard Rifkin. They have contributed to the program designed to help the Bolivian miners and the people of Bolivia in general. Mr. Kristula is returning to continue his work and Mr. Rifkin is resigning.
We are very pleased that these men have been spared and we are glad that they are with us today. I know that they will enjoy the entertainment that the press always gives their subjects.
