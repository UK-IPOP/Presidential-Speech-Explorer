My dear Mr. Snyder:
I am deeply interested to learn of the dinner on Wednesday evening to leaders of education and industry following the close of the seventh Conference of Major Industries. I will be obliged if you will express to this distinguished gathering my cordial greetings and good wishes. The growing relationship between education and business is a happy augury for both, and will lead to enlarged usefulness in both spheres of activity.

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
