 the American National Red Cross was established officially by the Congress of the United States and operates under grant of authority from the Government but nevertheless receives its support solely from the voluntary contributions and efforts of the American people; and
 the charter of the Red Cross imposes upon it specific duties and responsibilities in providing welfare services for the armed forces and for veterans and their families, and in meeting the needs of families suffering from disasters; and
 the American National Red Cross, working with the eighty-five nation League of Red Cross Societies, helps to alleviate human suffering caused by disaster or disease throughout the world; and
 in communities across this Nation more than two million Red Cross volunteers help their neighbors with youth services, a blood program, first aid, water safety, nursing services, and other humanitarian activities; and
, throughout its eighty years of varied and commendable services in our Nation, the Red Cross has earned the respect and gratitude of our citizens:
 President of the United State s of America and Honorary Chairman of the American National Red Cross, do hereby designate March 1961 as Red Cross Month; and I urge all Americans to support the Red Cross in its local, national, and international missions of mercy.
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-eighth day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen, hundred and sixty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fifth.

JOHN F. KENNEDY
