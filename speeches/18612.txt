Mr. President:
The people of the United States extend a very warm welcome to you, to Mrs. Lopez Mateos, and to your lovely daughter.
We feel that we are more than merely your geographical neighbor. We are proud to call you our friend. And we devoutly hope that you feel in that same fashion toward us.
We have very much in common--more than a common boundary of sixteen hundred miles in length; we live by the same values; we believe in human dignity and human rights and human freedom. We have the same objectives in our countries, of protecting and furthering the interests of each citizen, the humble and the great.
Through the years there has developed between our two countries a greater understanding, a greater affection, and for these things we are exceedingly grateful.
Moreover, one of our great objectives is that in search for peace. We are determined between ourselves to handle our problems that inevitably occur between friends and neighbors, on the basis of fairness and justice to both sides.
Now, for you today, I hope as you start this visit, you will experience, every minute you are here, the same warm feelings of cordial friendship on every side that I experienced when I was your guest in Acapulco--one of the brightest and most cherished memories that I have in my entire tour in this Office--they are those days that I spent with you.
And if the American people can make you feel that same deep satisfaction that comes from being surrounded by cordial friendship, I assure you, sir, they will try--there is no question about that.
So again, "bien venido."
