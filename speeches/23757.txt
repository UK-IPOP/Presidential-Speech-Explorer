Ladies anti gentlemen:
I know that you all join me in welcoming the Chancellor, the foreign Minister, the State Secretary, and the Ambassador of Austria and the other members of his party, here to the United States. We are very glad to have you here, Chancellor.
I think most of you know something of his life, his distinguished service in World War I, when he lost his leg--and 5 years in Dachau which tested the strength of his political convictions--his efforts since that time to maintain the integrity and the security of his country. And he has been joined in that effort by a number of distinguished Austrians, of whom one of the most distinguished is the foreign Minister, whom we are very glad to have here today and who has labored under burdens which would stagger a lesser man to maintain the very delicate balance which maintains his country's position.
So that we are delighted to have them all here. They come at a useful time, particularly when the events occurring in Europe hold such fruitful prospects. We are also glad to have the whole group here because they come from a very outstanding country which was very generous to Mrs. Kennedy and myself last June, and also to Secretary Dillon with the World Bank, and to probably all of us who have visited there at one time or another. All of us have come away with the warmest feelings of friendship for the Austrian people and to know that that friendship is reciprocated.
So, Chancellor, Minister, Ambassador, ladies and gentlemen, I know that you will join with me in drinking to our guests, to the country they represent--and to the President of Austria.
