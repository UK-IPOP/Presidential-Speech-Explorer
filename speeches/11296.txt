 President of the United States of America, do hereby find and declare, on the basis of such investigation and report, that the circumstances requiring the provisions of my proclamation of September 5, 1939, with respect to the classes of cotton and cotton waste hereinafter described no longer exist. Accordingly, pursuant to the aforesaid section 22, as further amended by the act of January 25, 1940 (54 Stat. 17), I hereby proclaim that the provisions of my proclamation of September 5, 1939, are suspended, effective immediately, insofar as they apply to the following classes of cotton and cotton waste:
