MR. PRESIDENT, it is indeed an honor for any American to invite you to this country. You have exemplified in your corner of the world patriotism of the highest order. You have brought to your great task of organizing your country the greatest of courage, the greatest of statesmanship--qualities that have aroused our admiration and make us indeed glad to welcome you.
We hope sincerely that the talks that we shall be able to have in these next few days will do much to strengthen still further the friendship between your country and this one. You are indeed welcome, sir.
