UPON THE OCCASION of the unveiling of the Columbus Monument at Palos, I have great pleasure in extending to the people of Spain in the name of the citizens of the United States an expression of friendly good wishes and an assurance of the abiding esteem felt in this country for that nation through whose generosity the great discoveries of Christopher Columbus were made possible.
