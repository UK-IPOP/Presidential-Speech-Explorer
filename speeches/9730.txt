To the Senate and House of Representatives:
It is my painful duty to inform you of the death today of Calvin Coolidge, former President of the United States.
There is no occasion for me to recount his eminent services to our country to members of the Senate and House, many of whom were so long associated with him. His entire lifetime has been one of single devotion to our country and his has been a high contribution to the welfare of mankind.
HERBERT HOOVER

The White House,

January 5, 1933.
