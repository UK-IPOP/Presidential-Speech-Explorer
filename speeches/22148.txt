Mr. Prime Minister:
This is an historic and happy occasion. The new cable between our countries is another welcome step toward transforming the Pacific from a barrier to a bridge between Asia and America.
I am sure that better communications will mean even better understanding between our peoples.
We are proud this symbol of the strong bonds of friendship between the United States and Japan is being placed in service this year when the Olympic games focus the eyes of the world on your country and on your capital city.
May I take this opportunity to express to you and your countrymen the sympathy and concern of my countrymen for the suffering and sorrow inflicted by the earthquakes this week.
We are proud to work with your country in the labors of the free world, Mr. Prime Minister--and it is my great pleasure to talk with you in this way tonight.
