I approve your recommendation and the recommendations of the Secretaries of State, Treasury, Commerce, the Acting Secretary of Defense and the Acting Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers regarding the release of 200,000 tons of copper from the national stockpile.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 5 of the Strategic and Critical Materials Stockpiling Act, as amended (50 U.S.C. 98(d)) and based on the recommendations mentioned above and the opinion of the Attorney General, I herewith determine that such release is required for purposes of the common defense. Disposals should be made through regular producer channels on a periodic basis and in such a way as to facilitate the orderly distribution of copper supplies with priorities to defense and defense-supporting users, such as ammunition manufacturers, as necessary.
I also approve the other recommendations in your memorandum of March 17.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
