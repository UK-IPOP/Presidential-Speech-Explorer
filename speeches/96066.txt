 President Bush met with the leadership of the European Union (EU), Slovenian Prime Minister and European Council President Janez Jansa and European Commission President Jos√© Manuel Barroso, at Brdo Castle in Slovenia to advance our efforts to jointly confront global challenges. Holding the U.S.-EU Summit in Slovenia, a country once behind the Iron Curtain and now a member of NATO and the EU, is a compelling example of the success of our common vision of a Europe whole, free, and at peace.
 In their discussions today, President Bush and European Union leaders discussed how to remove barriers to increase trade and investment to grow our economies and help lift people out of poverty.
