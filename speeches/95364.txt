 "Moron Moment for McCain ... and why some of us will NEVER support him. Cheap shot at Romney (candidate of change) as a set up for saying what a really fine guy Obama is." (Andy McCarthy, "Moron Moment For McCain,"

 "At certain moments it had the effect of making Romney look more sympathetic, at others it made him look like the only adult on stage, and at others it made him look like he must be the front-runner, since people were so determined to take him down a peg.

 "If you were looking for substance across the board on issues, I think Romney was the clear winner in tonight's debate.

 "Then McCain tussled with Romney over immigration and told him that Romney could spend his whole fortune calling McCain's immigration plan amnesty but he'd be wrong. Man, going after him for being rich, that's a blow. We'll see if voters think McCain's attacks crossed the line." (David Brody, "Brody File Reaction TO Republican Debate,"

 "McCain - the guy who was for amnesty before he was against it before acknowledging that it's the only solution and is not amnesty in the first place except it kinda, sorta is, except that he'd never be for amnesty - says Romney is the 'candidate of change.' Change. You'd almost think of a resolutely, died-in-the-wool pro-lifer filing a brief in the Supreme Court to suppress the First Amendment rights of a pro-life group to help pro-abortion incumbents get elected ... not that Senator Straight Talk would ever do such a thing ..."
