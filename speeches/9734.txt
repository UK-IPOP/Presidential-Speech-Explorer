THE PRESIDENT has today sent to Congress an estimate for an appropriation of $150,000 for continuation of the work of the Arms Conference and a message recommending an appropriation of $150,000 for expenses of participation of the United States in the International Economic Conference.
The purpose of these recommendations is to enable the Arms Conference to be carried forward, together with preparatory work of the Economic Conference, but more particularly to provide President-elect Roosevelt with necessary resources to carry forward these activities.
