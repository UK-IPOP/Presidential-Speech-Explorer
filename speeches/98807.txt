ARLINGTON, VA -- U.S. Senator John McCain's presidential campaign issued the following statement from Doug Holtz-Eakin, McCain 2008 Senior Policy Adviser, on the latest version of Barack Obama's plan for higher taxes on the American people:
"Barack Obama has voted in support of higher taxes 94 times in just 3 years, including higher taxes for Americans making just $42,000 a year. If voters consider Barack Obama's record of opposing tax cuts and his outspoken proposals to raise taxes on family savings, Social Security and small businesses -- this latest campaign promise lacks a single shred of credibility."
 (S. Con. Res. 70, CQ Vote #85: Adopted 51-44: R 2-43; D 47-1; I 2-0, 3/14/08, Obama Voted Yea; S. Con. Res. 70, CQ Vote #142: Adopted 48-45: R 2-44; D 44-1; I 2-0, 6/4/08, Obama Voted Yea)
 "The resolution Obama voted for would not have increased taxes on any single taxpayer making less than $41,500 per year in total income, or any couple making less than $83,000. The $32,000 figure is approximately the taxable income of a single person making $41,500 per year, after all deductions and exclusions." (FactCheck.org, "The $32,000 Question,"

 "The top two income-tax brackets would return to their 1990s levels of 36% and 39.6% (including the exemption and deduction phase-outs). All other brackets would remain as they are today." (Jason Furman and Austan Goolsbee, Op-Ed, "The Obama Tax Plan," 
, 8/14/08)
 "Sen. Obama believes that one of the principal problems facing the economy today is the lack of discretionary income for middle-class wage earners. That's why his plan would not raise any taxes on couples making less than $250,000 a year, nor on any single person with income under $200,000 -- not income taxes, capital gains taxes, dividend or payroll taxes."

 Obama: "If you are a family making less than $250,000, my plan will not raise your taxes - not your income taxes, not your payroll taxes, not your capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes." (Sen. Barack Obama, Remarks On Taxes, Kaukauna, WI, 6/12/08)
 Obama: "It is true that those like myself who are in the top 5 percent, we're going to see a tax increase. I'm going to roll the Bush tax cuts back to the levels they were in the 1990s." (Fox Business' "Fox Business," 6/26/08)

 Obama: "I have paid for every element of this economic agenda. By ending a war that's costing us billions, by closing tax loopholes for corporations, by putting a price on carbon pollution, and by ending George Bush's tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans." (Sen. Barack Obama, Remarks On Economic Prosperity, Janesville, WI, 2/13/08)
 Obama: "So I put forward a very specific plan. ... Those kinds of progressive tax steps, while closing loopholes and rolling back the Bush tax cuts to the top 1 percent, simply restores some fairness and a sense that we're all in this together, as opposed to each of us being in it on our own."

 "Even as Barack Obama proposes fiscally responsible tax reform to strengthen our economy and restore the balance that has been lost in recent years, we hear the familiar protests and distortions from the guardians of the broken status quo. Many of these very same critics made many of these same overheated predictions in previous elections. They said President Clinton's 1993 deficit-reduction plan would wreck the economy. ... Now they are making the same claims about Sen. Obama's tax plan, which has even lower taxes than prevailed in the 1990s -- including lower taxes on middle-class families, lower taxes for capital gains, and lower taxes for dividends."

 "The income tax boost accounts for more than half the revenue raised by the 1993 Clinton package.

 "Obama started his campaign saying his plans would not increase taxes for people earning less than $250,000. But he found himself in an apparent contradiction by saying he would tax all income to fund Social Security, not just income up to $102,000, as is now the case." (Abdon M.

 "While Obama has suggested imposing the 12.4 percent tax on all income above $97,000 per year, Edwards would only impose it on those making more than $200,000 per year.

 "Under current law, income up to $102,000 a year is taxed for Social Security. Obama would create a 'doughnut hole' by not imposing new Social Security taxes on income between $102,000 and $250,000. His aides said income exceeding $250,000 would be taxed at a rate of 2 percent to 4 percent, rather than the 6 percent tax that people pay toward Social Security on income below the $102,000 cutoff, which is matched by their employer's paying a 6 percent tax. Employers would probably pay an additional tax, but the total tax paid by both employee and employer would not exceed 4 percent of the amount of income earned over $250,000."

 Obama: "In terms of capital gains, I've suggested we might go back up to 20 (percent), because..." Fox News' Chris Wallace: "You had suggested 28 (percent)." Obama: "Well, what I've said is I certainly would not raise it higher than it was under Ronald Reagan, but the fact is that I'm mindful that we've got to keep our capital gains tax to a point where we can actually get more revenue. But that's not something that's going to affect the average person with a 401(k) when people start talking about how, 'Well, there are, you know, millions of Americans who own stock,' most of them own stock in 401(k)s where their taxes are deferred and they pay ordinary income taxes when they finally cash out."

 CNBC's Maria Bartiromo: "How do you plan to change the tax code when it comes to capital gains? How high will that 15 percent rate go?" Obama: "Well, you know, I haven't given a firm number. Here's my belief, that we can't go back to some of the, you know, confiscatory rates that existed in the past that distorted sound economics. And I certainly would not go above what existed under Bill Clinton, which was the 28 percent." (CNBC's "Closing Bell," 3/27/08)
 "The top capital-gains rate for families making more than $250,000 would return to 20% -- the lowest rate that existed in the 1990s and the rate President Bush proposed in his 2001 tax cut." (Jason Furman and Austan Goolsbee, Op-Ed, "The Obama Tax Plan,"
