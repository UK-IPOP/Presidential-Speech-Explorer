 This is spectacular, thanks.
 What are you getting there?
 I'm just getting, you know, about 400 calories a pop.
 I thought you gave up on the sweets, sir.
 Well, I'm confronted with excellent sweets. I'll be biking this weekend, in other words. Are you a biker these days?
 I'm ready to go.
 You are? Record that. [

 You will enjoy these thoroughly. They're wonderful. Just for the President.
 I'm looking forward to it.
How much do I owe you?
 They are free.
 No, they're not free.
 Okay, $5.28 with tax.
 How's your business doing?
 Wonderful.
 Seventy-two cents is your change.
 So good to meet you.
 Nice to meet you.
 Appreciate you, candy man, great to see you all. Thanks for saying hi. Good to meet you.
All right, listen, buy something here. [

 Can you spot me $5? [

 Thank you all. Hey, Tommyâ€”you remember Tommy.
 Yes. Hi, Tommy.
 It's always good to see you.
 Thank you all. Is anybody going to buy anything here? I'm trying to drum up a little business. [

 As long as you don't leave us behind.
 Leave no reporter behind. [
