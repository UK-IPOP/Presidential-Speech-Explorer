The Administration supports H.R. 2864, which would codify the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's consultation program. This program provides free safety and health assistance to approximately 25,000 workplaces annually.
H.R. 2864 would not affect direct spending or receipts; therefore, it is not subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.
