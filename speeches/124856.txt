Marco Rubio: No new taxes of any kind. Any new tax does not lead to economic growth. 
 


— Mark Rivera (@markriv) 
Rubio: "Believe it or not, multiple Republican candidates for president support new taxes on the American people."

In economic speech, Rubio hits Republicans who support what he dubs "intentionally sneaky" Value Added Tax (i.e. Ted Cruz, Rand Paul).

Rubio: Some R candidates support "imposing a new tax that generations of conservatives have fought against, called a Value Added Tax."
