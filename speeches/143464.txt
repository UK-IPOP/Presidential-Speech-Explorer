Greetings,
I will be your in-town print pooler today. POTUS does not have any events currently scheduled. The briefing is slated for 1:30 PM.
The briefing will be at 2 PM now, White House says.
Two minute warning for the briefing
The briefing wrapped at about 2:58 PM.
The White House called a travel/photo lid at 3:40 PM.
Good evening,
President Biden's trip to Chicago will no longer be taking place tomorrow.
The White House has sent an update on the president's conversations with lawmakers.
In meetings and calls over the weekend and through today, President Biden has been engaging with members of Congress on the path forward for the Build Back Better Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal. He will now remain at the White House tomorrow to continue working on advancing these two pieces of legislation to create jobs, grow the economy, and make investments in families, rather than failed giveaways to the rich and big corporations.
There will be more to come on his engagement over the next couple of days, and the trip to Chicago to discuss the ongoing importance of getting people vaccinated will be rescheduled.
