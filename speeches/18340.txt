Your Majesties:
I count it an opportunity and a rare distinction to welcome the two of you here as the guests of our Nation in this Capital.
For Mrs. Eisenhower and myself it is a particularly happy opportunity that we may repay something of the hospitality you so graciously extended to us two years ago in Athens.
May your stay here be an enjoyable one, and may you find as much pleasure in our house as we did in yours.
