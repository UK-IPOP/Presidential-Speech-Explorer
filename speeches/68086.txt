Dole/Kemp '96 Deputy Press Secretary Christina Martin released the following statement today:
"Most senior citizens won't tolerate double talk from their grandchildren, let alone their President. Yet, Bill Clinton continues to talk a false game while raising taxes on Social Security benefits, threatening retirement security, and leading Medicare down a path of imminent bankruptcy.
"It is Bob Dole, and Bob Dole only, who has seniors in mind as he plans for the future ... and when he talks you can count on it being straight-forward and honest. Bob Dole is calling for a 15% across- the-board tax reduction and preservation of programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Bob Dole is also setting out to right a wrong by repealing Bill Clinton's 1993 tax hike on Social Security recipients -- a Clinton mistake that is costing some Social Security recipients approximately $ 1,000 a year. (Bruce Bartlett, Testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, 3/1/95)"
