[Released June 30, 1946. Dated June 28, 1946]
Dear Mr. Ross:
I have your letter of June 28, containing the resignations of yourself and your fellow Committee members, together with recommendations made pursuant to Executive Order No. 9664.
The members of your Committee performed an important war service task of great difficulty and delicacy. They performed it capably, even under a continuous barrage of criticism and harassment.
The degree of effectiveness which the Fair Employment Practice Committee was able to attain has shown once and for all that it is possible to equalize job opportunity by governmental action, and thus eventually to eliminate the influence of prejudice in the field of employment.
Please convey to the members of the Committee my appreciation of the devotion they brought to this war-time task. I thank them for their service, and I accept their resignations with great regret.

Very sincerely yours,
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Mr. Malcolm Ross, Chairman, Fair Employment practice Committee, Washington 25, D.C.]
