THE FORMER PRESIDENT of the United States has once again placed his great talents at the disposal of the government, and I am sure that I speak for the people of the nation as I take this occasion to thank him publicly for responding to this call to duty.
The government is fortunate that Mr. Farley has likewise agreed to help the Commission in its work. His knowledge of government and its functions will be of inestimable value to the tremendous task confronting the Commission.
