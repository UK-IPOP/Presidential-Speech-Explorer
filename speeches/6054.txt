I submit to you herewith the report of the American members of the International Waterways Commission regarding the preservation of Niagara Falls. I also submit to you certain letters from the Secretary of State and the Secretary of War, including memoranda showing what has been attempted by the Department of State in the effort to secure the preservation of the falls by treaty.
I earnestly recommend that Congress enact into law the suggestions of the American members of the International Waterways Commission for the preservation of Niagara Falls, without waiting for the negotiation of a treaty. The law can be put in such form that it will lapse, say in three years, provided that during that time no international agreement has been reached. But in any event I hope that this Nation will make it evident that it is doing all in its power to preserve the great scenic wonder, the existence of which, unharmed, should be a matter of pride to every dweller on this continent.
