 It is such a joy to be here to Graceland. It's my first visit.
 My first visit too.
 The Prime Minister's first visit.
 It's like a dream, with President Bush and Presley's daughter.
 Thank you all for greeting us. You're awfully kind to be here.
 You look like Elvis.

 The visit here is an indication of how well-known Elvis was around the world. A lot of people are still singing Elvis Presley songs here in the States, and there's a lot of people who love Elvis Presley in Japan, including the Prime Minister. This visit is also a way of reminding us about the close friendship between our peoples.
And, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for agreeing to come here. A lot of Americans are thrilled you're here, particularly to Graceland. It means a lot to our country that you would be that interested in one of America's icons, Elvis Presley.
 My birthday is the same as Elvis's.
 You and Elvis were born on the same day?
 January 8th. Even now, I often listen to Elvis CDs.
 Still listen to Elvis CDs?
 Sure.
 You're a pretty good Elvis singer.
 I'm not impersonator.

 I thought you were going to do "Blue Suede Shoes." Thank you.
