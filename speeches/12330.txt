 certain public islands lying off the coast of Southern California contain fossils of Pleistocene elephants and ancient trees, and furnish noteworthy examples of ancient volcanism, deposition, and active sea erosion, and have situated thereon various other objects of geological and scientific interest; and
 it appears that it would be in the public interest to reserve such lands as a national monument, to be known as the Channel Islands National Monument:
