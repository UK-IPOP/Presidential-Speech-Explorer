My dear Mr.___________:
I am transmitting herewith the draft of a bill which will make it possible to complete our interstate highway system by 1972. The program will be financed on a pay-as-you-go basis.
I am convinced that either stretching out or cutting back our highway program would be unwise. It would be particularly unfortunate today, when our economy needs the growth, our people need the safety, and our national defense needs the security that this program helps provide. Unless this legislation is enacted promptly, apportionments to the States will have to be reduced substantially below desired levels.
This is a sound method for resolving the difficulties the program now faces and for meeting our responsibilities to the future.
I am also enclosing a letter from the Secretary of Commerce dealing with the measure.

Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY
