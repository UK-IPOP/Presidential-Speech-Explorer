"As governor, Mitt Romney presided over a historic turnaround of Massachusetts. Under Governor Romney's leadership, Massachusetts' unemployment rate fell to 4.7%, the economy created tens of thousands of new jobs, and the state's rainy day fund grew to over $2 billion. If President Obama had half of Mitt Romney's record, he'd be running on it." – Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson

"Romney's policies are credited with improving the state's competitiveness. His administration promoted high-density development to increase housing production, got a fast-track permitting law enacted by the Legislature to help businesses expand, and revived an agency to help firms move to the state." (Brian Mooney, Stephanie Ebbert and Scott Helman, "Ambitious Goals,"

 "When Mitt Romney became governor of Massachusetts in 2003, the state had a budget gap of almost $3 billion and was losing thousands of jobs a month. In Mr. Romney's four-year tenure, the deficit was eliminated without raising the sales tax or the income tax, and since the labor slump hit bottom in December 2003, the state has gained 81,000 jobs."

 "Yet much good conservative work was done on his watch: restructuring and streamlining of state government, the elimination of a $3 billion deficit and the addition of $2 billion to a 'rainy day' fund, and reducing red tape for small businesses - all without raising taxes or adding to state debt."

Deval Patrick yesterday signed a $32.5 billion state budget that raises state aid for public schools by 4.5 percent and counts on $700 million in health care cost savings to achieve balance. ... The budget supports spending with $350 million drawn from the state's reserve account, leaving the rainy day fund with a projected balance of $1.28 billion."
