IT IS gratifying to know that these distinguished Americans will serve the National Endowment for the Humanities in its effort to achieve educational and public goals of great importance to all our people. In the 2 short years of its existence, the Endowment has affected many diverse groups in the country. Children from inner-city schools are participating in summer enrichment programs. Men and women are receiving encouragement to further their interest in the history of their communities and States. Grants enable scholars to discover and interpret America's past, and permit young college teachers to pursue important research. Valuable programs such as these can only be identified and supported with the thoughtful guidance of the National Council on the Humanities. These new members will, I am confident, continue the excellent work of their predecessors.
