-

 Our economic and military strength require that we end our strategic vulnerability to an oil shut-off by nations like Iran, Russia, and Venezuela, and that we address environmental concerns. To do this, Governor Romney has called for a bold and far-reaching research initiative - an Energy Revolution - to be our generation's equivalent of the Manhattan Project or the Moon mission. This will be a mission to create new, economic sources of clean energy.
 Many of our civilian national security and foreign policy structures were created decades ago to confront Cold War threats. Building on the Goldwater-Nichols military reforms of the 1980s, we need to ensure that our civilian instruments of national power have the ability to build joint efforts among our civilian agencies and empower Regional Deputies with clear lines of authority, budgets and responsibility to develop and execute regional plans and strategies. We must also constantly challenge bureaucratic "group think" and revitalize our national security structures so we have the capabilities needed to meet 21st century challenges.
 The failures of efforts such as the United Nations Human Rights Council have given multilateralism a bad name. But America's strength is amplified when it is combined with the strength of other nations. We need to look to expand alliances such as NATO to face the new threat of radical Jihad and increase our homeland security.
 As President, Governor Romney will call together our Middle East allies and the major nations of the developed world to address these issues by establishing a Partnership for Hope and Prosperity. This Partnership would assemble the resources of all developed nations to assure that threatened Islamic states have public schools, micro credit and banking, the rule of law, human rights, basic health care, and competitive economic policies. Resources would be drawn from public and private institutions, and from volunteers and NGOs. Its policies would favor expansion of free trade and investment.
