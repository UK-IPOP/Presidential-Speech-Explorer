IT IS with personal pleasure and satisfaction that I have today approved S. 1723, a bill to admit young Canadians to Annapolis and West Point. These men should benefit by the experience gained at the two institutions, while our young men will derive a broader background and perspective from knowing Canadians at closer range. The associations formed in common during these undergraduate years should serve to strengthen still more the excellent relationship, rounded on full friendship and mutual confidence, which exists between the two countries.
