His Excellency

Ngo Dinh Diem

President of the Republic of Viet-Nam
I was deeply touched by your message. Your most welcome visit to the United States has served to strengthen even further the friendship between our two countries and to permit the people of this country to demonstrate their high esteem for you and the people of Viet-Nam. It has been a very great pleasure for me to have met you personally and to have had a frank exchange of views on matters of mutual interest to our countries. The progress of the Republic of Viet-Nam, under your leadership, in promoting peace, stability and the general welfare of the Vietnamese people augurs well for the future of your country.
My warmest wishes go with you on your return to Viet-Nam.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
