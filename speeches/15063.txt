MRS. JONES, I congratulate you on this award.
Next to a child's mother, the greatest influence on his character and his growth into a good citizen is his teacher.
I remember with much pleasure the teachers I had when I was going through the grade schools and through high school. Some of them are still alive, and I still keep in touch with those that are alive.
They had a tremendous influence on the route which I followed in informing myself on government, on the Republic of the United States, and what it means. And I am more than happy for this opportunity of bringing the attention of the country to the fact that one of its main supports, and one of the reasons why it is the greatest Republic in the world has been due to the teachers who take young minds and train them to be citizens as they should be.
Therefore, it is a great pleasure to me to have you here this morning.
