Hon. LINN BOYD,
I communicate to the House of Representatives herewith a report from the Secretary of the Interior, dated the 24th instant, containing so ranch of the information called for by the resolution of the 17th instant as it is practicable or compatible with the public interest to furnish at the present time, respecting the proceedings which have been had and negotiations entered into for the extinguishment of the Indian titles to lands west of the States of Missouri and Iowa.
FRANKLIN PIERCE.
