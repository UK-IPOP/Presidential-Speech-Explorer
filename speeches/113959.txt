"Over the last four years, President Obama has run up trillions of dollars in new debt that the next generation will be forced to repay. This week, the Obama Administration confirmed we'll need yet another debt ceiling hike shortly after the election. Middle-class Americans and job creators can't afford four more years like the last four years. As president, Mitt Romney will deliver real change by cutting wasteful spending and putting our nation on the path toward a balanced budget." — Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson

 OBAMA: "[T]oday I'm pledging to cut the deficit we inherited in half by the end of my first term in office. This will not be easy. It will require us to make difficult decisions and face challenges we've long neglected. But I refuse to leave our children with a debt that they cannot repay — and that means taking responsibility right now, in this administration, for getting our spending under control." (President Barack Obama,

 OBAMA: "The problem is, is that the way Bush has done it over the last eight years is to take out a credit card from the Bank of China in the name of our children, driving up our national debt from $5 trillion for the first 42 presidents - #43 added $4 trillion by his lonesome, so that we now have over $9 trillion of debt that we are going to have to pay back -- $30,000 for every man, woman and child. That's irresponsible. It's unpatriotic." (Sen. Barack Obama,

 DANNER: "Equally important, small-business owners are alarmed by the precipitous increase of our national debt and deficit. They know that you can't keep a business running if you keep spending your way into oblivion and they wonder why the government can't operate more like a business. Electing leaders who understand our nation's debt and spending crisis and who put forth viable solutions to reduce the burden on future generations is very important to the small-business community."

 OBAMA: "It is important though to recognize if we keep on adding to the debt, even in the midst of this recovery, that at some point, people could lose confidence in the U.S. economy in a way that could actually lead to a double-dip recession."(Fox News, "
