Good morning from the White House on this Father's Day. The in-town travel pool is gathering at the Palm Room doors. Destination not yet known.
There are no public events on the president's schedule.
For those interested, your pooler did not receive a COVID-19 test at the White House this morning.
At 10:29 a.m., the motorcade is rolling from the White House for what appears to be a trip to Virginia, since there's a state trooper helping to lead the way.
Your pooler has not seen President Trump.
Temperature checks were administered at the gate and again before boarding the press vans in the motorcade.
The motorcade has arrived at Trump National in Sterling, Va.
The press vans veered off from the rest of the motorcade at 11:05 a.m. The pool will be holding at the nearby Italian restaurant.
After pulling in to the parking lot of the Italian restaurant and having a brief discussion, the pool is now rolling towards Trump National itself.

The pool took a brief drive by the entrance of Trump National for visual purposes.
We have returned to holding at the Italian restaurant.
At 2:36 p.m., the pool vans departed the restaurant parking lot. We're holding now on the side of the road outside Trump National.
There's a small group of protesters gathered nearby.
The motorcade rolled out of the Trump National property at 3:40 p.m.
The pool did not see President Trump, but Republican strategist Brian Bartlett (@BrianBartlett) tweeted at your pooler from inside the property.
The thread includes a brief video showing POTUS with a red hat and white shirt.
