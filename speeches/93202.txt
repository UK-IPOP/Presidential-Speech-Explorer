 "Of all the problems Giuliani will face, none will loom larger – or sooner – than the question of what to do about the city's finances. Under a tough law passed after the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970s, he will be required to explain in January how he plans to close the gap in the current year's budget, estimated at about $400 million [and growing]. Soon after, he will be required to come up with the outline of his budget for the fiscal year starting next summer, which currently contains a projected $1.5-billion deficit [and growing]."

 "A study commissioned by the Hotel Association of the City of New York and the New York State Hospitality and Tourism Association found that the city is the highest-taxed destination in the country, at $23.74 per night, compared with $7.67 in other major cities. As a result, hoteliers and tourism officials say, the city is losing business, some of it just across the Hudson to hotels in New Jersey."

 "The [hotel] tax has annoyed various meeting planners to the extent that some are boycotting New York.

 "At least a few New Yorkers have long despaired of making non-New Yorkers grasp the gargantuan perversity of the city's welfare system. Help has arrived. 'Hands to Work,' by Columbia journalism Prof. LynNell Hancock, purports to be an expose of welfare reform under Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. It is far more profitably read as a breathtaking tour of the mindset — supplied by the author and by those she writes about — that for decades made New York the welfare capital of the world."

 "[O]ur moral critique — if anything, I feel, in retrospect, I was not bold enough in Washington, DC. Our moral critique of the welfare state is going to accelerate, and the place it's happening is at the state and local governments. I mean, Giuliani, in his real reform of welfare, is in fact, behaving as an absolute revolutionary." (Newt Gingrich, Remarks At Progress And Freedom Foundation Conference, Washington, DC, 1/22/96)
 "The Giuliani administration, which created the nation's largest and most successful workfare program among single adults in the Home Relief program, is now extending the work requirement to recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children i.e., single mothers.

 ANDREW MURR: "Crime dropped dramatically in NYC when you were there and when Giuliani was mayor. He's taking credit for part of that. What portion of the credit does the mayor deserve?" BRATTON: "[I]t could not have been done without Giuliani. In New York City, one of the great strengths of [the mayor's] position is you have ability to coordinate all elements of the criminal-justice system. … But he deserves significant credit. It could not have been done with the speed and the comprehensiveness and the ultimate impact without him." (Andrew Murr, "Bratton Hugs Back," Newsweek.com,

 BRATTON: "[Giuliani's] great strength was believing that you could do something about crime. … Giuliani basically fought all the political fights against all the naysayers who said it couldn't be done. So he provided the opportunity and the leadership and fought a lot of the political battles with what was at that time an extraordinarily liberal city."

 "As the 1988 Republican nominee, Vice President George Bush will lug with him a long list of political liabilities. … But with the right choice [for Vice President] … Bush could simultaneously turn disadvantage to advantage and the political world on its ear. … Now admittedly Rudolph Giuliani is not a household name, but if you need references … [G]iuliani led the prosecution of the 'pizza connection' in which eight New York Mafia chiefs were convicted and jailed. Who put corrupt executives from Wedtech … behind bars? It was the same man who put Bronx Democratic boss Stanley Friedman away and the prosecutor who risked the wrath of editorial writers, organized labor and politicians by moving for a takeover of the corruption-ridden Teamsters' union. There is a strong argument against putting any first-time candidate on a national ticket. Nobody, it's argued, is prepared for the scalding scrutiny. But you know that Rudolph Giuliani, who has terrorized dirty cops, sleazy politicians and criminals on Wall Street, has been investigated by all of them in an effort to discredit him. Death threats have not slowed him down. He's clean as a hound's tooth; he's gone after all the big boys; he's tough as nails, incorruptible and as untouchable as Eliot Ness.

Wednesday in Des Moines, Iowa, the Republican presidential frontrunner unveiled several attractive ideas to 'restore fiscal discipline and cut wasteful Washington spending.' … Why should anyone believe Giuliani ever would implement such clever plans? Well, he already has. As mayor of New York, Giuliani used similar reforms to reverse the city's decline and rejuvenate its finances."
