FIRST OF ALL, you know how much I will prize the portrait that was made by Sir Oswald Birley. To have a replica will be a very great honor, and to have you bring it to me is something that I can scarcely imagine. You know how I have felt toward you all these years. I assure you it will always be the same, and I will always have the same feeling toward all those other people that make up that great band that I am privileged to call my British friends.
Thank you.
