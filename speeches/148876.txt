A lunch lid has been called until 1 p.m.
The White House has extended the lunch lid until 2:30 p.m.
As previously noted, the lid was pushed back several times today. The press pool linked up with the presidential motorcade at 3:54 p.m., and we're on the move to a yet-to-be-disclosed location.
President Biden arrived at St. Edmond's Catholic Church at 4:00 p.m. Your pooler did not see whether anyone else was with him.
President Biden left St. Edmond's Catholic Church at 4:58 p.m.
Biden waived at the small crowd gathered across the street, who cheered as he walked down the church steps. When a local resident shouted "we love you, Joe," the president turned around and said "Thank you."
While Biden was in the church, a few people gathered at a distance to observe the scene, including a friendly Jack Russell-pug mix named Jimmy, who greeted some members of the press pool.
The pool is now rolling to a location that has not been announced.
Travel/photo lid called at 5:12 p.m.
