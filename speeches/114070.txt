"In recent weeks, President Obama can't seem to settle on his greatest failure in office — he's claimed it's the tone in Washington, immigration reform, and even his storytelling skills. But it's clear the President's greatest failure — by far — is his inability to fix our economy. With 23 million Americans struggling for work and anemic economic growth, the middle class simply can't afford four more years like the last four years. Mitt Romney will deliver a real recovery with 12 million new jobs, robust economic growth, and a stronger middle class." — Ryan Williams, Romney Campaign Spokesman
