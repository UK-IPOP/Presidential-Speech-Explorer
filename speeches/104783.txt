Today, the President called for the Senate to pass the Small Business Jobs Act to strengthen the capacity of small businesses to create jobs and lead an economic recovery. The legislation includes several key Administration initiatives - including the Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF), the State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI), extension and expansion of key SBA loan programs, and small business tax cuts including zero capital gains for key small business investments. The House of Representatives passed similar small business legislation on June 17, 2010.

Administration proposals in this package have received broad support from organizations representing small businesses and community banks. The Independent Community Bankers of America and 29 state banking associations have urged "prompt enactment of the Small Business Jobs Act with the SBLF," calling the SBLF "a bold, fresh proposal." The National Small Business Association has argued that "The Small Business Jobs Act, if passed in its entirety, would provide much-needed access to capital for small businesses." In supporting the Small Business Jobs Act, the National Federation of Independent Business specifically praised the SBLF: "[T]he lending fund has the potential to help credit-worthy small businesses that have had difficulties obtaining credit."

 By providing $30 billion in capital to small banks with incentives to increase small business lending, the SBLF- which would be established, through new legislation, as completely separately from TARP - could support several multiples of that amount in new lending.

2. 
 In consultation with several Governors and Members of the House and Senate, the President proposed a State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) to strengthen state programs that support lending to small businesses and small manufacturers. The program allows states to build upon successful models, including collateral support programs, Capital Access Programs (CAPs), and loan guarantee programs.

1. 
 The President has called for - and the Senate bill includes - elimination of capital gains taxes on certain small business investments. Under the Recovery Act the President signed last year, 75 percent of these capital gains would be excluded from taxes - this provision goes one step further and fully excludes these capital gains from taxes.

2. 
The bill extends - as the President proposed in his budget - a Recovery Act "bonus depreciation" provision that encourages businesses to invest in plants and equipment by accelerating the rate at which they can deduct capital expenditures. The Recovery Act provision is projected to reduce business taxes by about $38 billion in 2009 and 2010.

3. 
 The Administration has supported small businesses by further extending provisions in the Recovery Act and HIRE Act that increase the amount of investments these firms can immediately write offâ€”providing an tax incentive to expand and create new jobs. The Senate legislation includes an increase in the amount small businesses can write off and the level at which this write-off phases out for both 2010 and 2011. 


The Administration's small business jobs initiatives currently under consideration by the Senate have received broad support from organizations, including:
