"This will be America's first such treaty in Sub-Saharan Africa in nearly a decade. It reflects our shared commitment to systems of fair and open investment. It will bring more capital to Rwanda's dynamic and growing economy."
 The BIT will enter into force after ratification by the United States and Rwanda, following approval of the Treaty by the United States Senate and the Rwanda Parliament. This is the first BIT concluded between the United States and a Sub-Saharan African country since 1998.*
 These protections include nondiscriminatory treatment, free transfer of investment-related funds, prompt, adequate, and effective compensation in the event of an expropriation, and transparency in governance. The BIT also gives investors the right to bring investment disputes to neutral, international arbitration panels.
 While the current level of U.S. investment in Rwanda is modest, several large U.S. companies conduct business with Rwandan firms and are exploring trade-related initiatives with the Rwandan Government.
* The United States currently has five BITs in force with Sub-Saharan African countries: Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, the Republic of Congo, and Senegal.
