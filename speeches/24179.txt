IT IS important that the recommendations of the Council and the Conference receive serious attention by local, State, and Federal government officials. And much more than official action is involved here. Many of the recommendations in this report deal with the role of the private sector in fulfilling the rights of Negro Americans. Organized labor, the business community, foundations, religious, educational, and civic organizations have a vital role to play in that crucial effort.
The recommendations of this Conference should be studied and discussed by every thoughtful and responsible American, and wherever practicable they should be implemented without delay.
There may be recommendations on which it is not possible to secure agreement among men of good will. That is to be expected with a subject of this gravity and complexity. But the report gives us an agenda for debate and action for years to come. Thus it more than justifies the months of painstaking effort that went into its preparation.
