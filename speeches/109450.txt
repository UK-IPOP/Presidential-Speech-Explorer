"We already knew about the Obama Rule — the insistence on raising taxes to support more spending and even bigger government. Now we have the Biden Rule, which is the Vice President's repeated equation of higher taxes with patriotism. Americans know that our taxes are already too high and that Washington spends too much money. In November, they will have the chance to tell the Obama Administration that enough is enough." —Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 BIDEN: "I often point out, wealthy people are just as patriotic as poor people. They're just as patriotic as middle-class people. And I think they know — I think they know they should be doing more." (Vice President Joe Biden, Campaign Event, Exeter, NH, 4/12/12)
 "Democratic vice presidential candidate U.S. Sen. Joe Biden said Thursday that people earning more than $250,000 should ‘be patriotic' and pay more taxes. ... ‘It's time to be patriotic,' said Biden. ‘Time to be part of the deal. Time to help get America out of the rut.'" ("Biden: Wealthy Paying Taxes 'Patriotic',"
