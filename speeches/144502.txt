America is on the move, and we see the signs of that across our economy. There has been historic job growth since President Biden took office – more than 2 million jobs created, and a monthly average of 540,000 new jobs – the most in any President's first four months. The average number of new unemployment claims has been cut in half since President Biden took office. And, independent projections from the Federal Reserve, the World Bank, the OECD, and many others all forecast America this year reaching the highest levels of growth in nearly four decades.
Over the past week, we have seen continued evidence that President Biden's economic plan is working.
