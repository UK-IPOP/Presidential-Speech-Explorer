Pool is holding inside the hotel, ahead of Biden's remarks.
Pool was ushered into the fundraiser at 7:59pm, where Biden had just begun speaking to a group of 18 seated at two long tables, as well as four virtual attendees.
Biden, seated at the head of the table, spoke for roughly 9 minutes, largely about his climate agenda. At the outset, he called the climate crisis "the existential threat to humanity. That's not hyperbole."
Biden also spoke to the urgency of slowing the planet's warming, saying "Our grandchildren will never forgive us and the world will change."
Biden later mentioned that he has a call with a foreign leader at 8:40pm. Am asking for additonao details and will pass along.
More quotes to come.
In interim, WH passes along the names of two attendees.
Introducing Biden at the event was: Elizabeth "Lise" Strickler, Co-Founder, Three Cairns Group
Also asking Biden a question as the pool left (could not hear the specifics of the question): Nathaniel "Nat" Simons, co-founder, Prelude Ventures
Attached is a recording of Biden's remarks.
On his climate agenda, Biden said there's "a long way to go" and that he's running into some obstacles.
Biden at one point referenced Russia's invasion of Ukraine as an example for "why we need to get off our dependence on fossil fuels."
He also said he's going to continue to take executive action on climate "where I can," but did not offer specifics.
As always, check quotes against the recording and transcript.
Pool is heading back to the vans.
