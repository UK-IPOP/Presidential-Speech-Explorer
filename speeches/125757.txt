In the Republican field, the USHCC formally endorsed Kasich, recognizing the Ohio governor as someone who has consistently fought for policies encouraging economic growth. The USHCC acknowledged Kasich's efforts as a policymaker to balance the federal budget in 1997, closing Ohio's $8 billion budget shortfall and creating over 425,000 jobs in the private sector.
In regards to both Clinton and Kasich endorsements, the USHCC made a swipe at Republican front-runner Donald Trump, a businessman based from New York City. Palomarez recognized there is a lot at stake in the upcoming presidential election and Americans cannot let the U.S. divide further.
"There is so much at stake in this election and our country cannot afford to have those who would divide our nation and prey on the fears of the American people as our President," said Palomarez.
