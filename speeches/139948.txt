Greetings from a crisp, sunny, 50 degree day at the White House. President Trump is at Camp David. He called in to Fox News's Maria Bartiromo's show this morning. He's scheduled to depart Camp David aboard Marine One at 11:30 am and touch down on the South Lawn at 12:05 pm.

Your pooler was tested for COVID-19 and is awaiting the President's arrival. Construction is continuing on the Inauguration viewing stands at the edge of Lafayette Park. From outside the press room doors, intermittent hammering can be heard. 


Marine One landed on the South Lawn at 12:27 pm.

President Trump walked off Marine One with three of his grandchildren Arabella, Theodore and Joseph. (Ivanka and Jared's kids.) He did not stop to answer questions shouted by reporters. He was asked if he was planning to attend Biden's inauguration, who else he plans to pardon, and whether he was considering a pardon for himself. It is unclear if he heard the questions.

President Trump was returning to the White House after spending a night at Camp David.

(The White House said Marine One left Camp David at 11:49 am.) 


The White House called a travel photo lid at 12:36 pm. Have a great day all.
