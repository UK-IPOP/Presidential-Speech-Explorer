VICE ADMIRAL BURKLEY has served two Presidents, President Kennedy and myself, and an entire generation of servicemen, with high distinction, loyalty, and great skill. He is a healer who honors the tradition of his profession. He is going on the retired list now after an active duty career that began the day after Pearl Harbor. He leaves with my enduring gratitude and that of the two White House staffs he has served so ably.
