This week in Cornwall, the United States and G7+ Leaders announced more than one billion safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines to accelerate global coverage. This announcement means that since 2020, the G7+ has committed to financing and providing approximately 2.3 billion vaccines for the world. The United States is providing nearly half of that support and is the single largest COVID-19 vaccine donor in the world. This 2.3 billion total includes support for expanding local production capacity around the world to add more than a billion doses to the global vaccine supply by the end of 2022.
G7+ countries have previously committed to finance and share more than 1 billion doses.
G7+ investment in local vaccine production capacity will support at least 1 billion vaccine doses by the end of 2022.
The G7+ agreed to provide an additional more than 1 billion doses starting summer 2021.
The United States calls on countries to donate additional doses of safe and effective vaccines, strengthen vaccine readiness, and work with private sector partners to vaccinate the world. In addition to support for the G7+ commitment on vaccines, the United States will continue to share doses from our domestic supply as they become available.
