 to view the ad. The script is below.
 "An enemy without borders. Hate without boundaries. A people perverted. A religion betrayed. A nuclear power in chaos. Madmen bent on creating it. Leaders assassinated. Democracy attacked. And Osama bin Laden still making threats. In a world where the next crisis is a moment awayâ€¦ America needs a leader who's ready."
 "I'm Rudy Giuliani and I approved this message."
