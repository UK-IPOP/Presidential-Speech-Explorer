Your pooler spied a red golf cap as POTUS emerged from the White House. Call time was moved up to 8 am; the forecast is for scattered thunderstorms this afternoon and highs around 90.
The motorcade arrived at Trump National golf club in Sterling at 9:50 am after an uneventful ride. There were a few protesters at the entrance, including one woman holding a sign that said “I ordered Mary's book.”

A Jeep drove by, repeatedly, bearing a “Trump 2020” banner fluttering on a pole.
