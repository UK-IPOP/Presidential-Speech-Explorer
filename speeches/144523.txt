Hello from the White House!
I'm your in town pooler for the day. A lunch lid has been called until 2:45.
President Biden will sign the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act into law and will deliver remarks with the Vice President in the East Room at 3:30.
I'll check back in later with any updates!
Pool has gathered ahead of the Juneteenth Act signing and remarks delivered by President Biden and Vice President Harris.
Pool is in the East Room for the bill signing. Four rows of seats are spread across the room. Representatives Maxine Waters, Ayanna Pressley, Ilhan Omar and other members of the CBC are in the audience. Biden and Harris walked in to applause.
Harris looked out over the crowd and smiled when she announced that Juneteenth would become a national holiday. White House staff will send a full list of attendees after the event.
Opal Lee, the activist known as the grandmother of Juneteenth, is seated in the front row of the audience as Biden delivers remarks about her efforts to make Juneteenth a national holiday. She leaned in toward the stage and smiled as President Biden told the story of her efforts.
Vice President Harris held Opal's hand as President Biden signed the act and handed her a pen.
The pool was led out of the East Room at 4:10 pm while President Biden spoke with members of Congress and a lid was called at 4:48pm.
Have a good night y'all!
