Yesterday, Vice President Kamala Harris announced the 
 to upgrade our public schools with modern, clean, energy efficient facilities and transportation. The Action Plan activates the entire federal government in leveraging Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and American Rescue Plan investments to deliver health and learning benefits to children and school communities, save school districts money, and create good union jobs. It provides tools and funding that schools, school districts, states and local communities can all use to work together to address this critical challenge.
As part of the Action Plan, the Department of Energy 
 through President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to make public schools more energy efficient and save schools money. This new program will lower energy costs, improve air quality, and prioritize schools most in need, enabling schools to focus more resources on student learning.
Delaware Senator Tom Carper, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works: "No parent should worry about the quality of air their child is breathing in school — whether in the classroom or on a school bus. That's why I am delighted to see the Biden-Harris Administration taking action to reduce harmful pollution in our schools and improve the health of our students and teachers. Today's announcement will help our nation's schools access the historic funding that Congress has provided for air quality monitoring, clean school buildings, and clean transportation provided in the American Rescue Plan and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. We fought for these investments to deliver better educational experiences for students across our country — especially those in historically underserved communities that have long carried the burden of high pollution." [Statement, 4/4/22]

"BEL was honored to be with Vice-President Harris and Secretary Granholm for a special event that took place at Thomas Elementary Achool in Washington, DC. In her remarks introducing an initiative to "upgrade our public schools with modern, clean, energy efficient facilities and transportation," the Vice President pointed to the importance of school buses, which represent the nation's largest form of public transportation. The takeaway for BEL? The benefits of electric school buses are scalable. We hope to help provide access to the funding for rural areas and others local communities who can use the money saved by switching to electric to meet other school and educational needs." [

"Today's announcement marks a strong step toward better health and educational outcomes for children in our public schools, especially for communities of color that are disproportionately impacted by toxic pollution. This whole-of-government approach to school infrastructure will help ensure kids in schools breathe cleaner air while saving districts money and creating good-paying jobs. More than 25 million children ride dirty diesel-powered school buses each day, and programs like the Biden-Harris Action Plan for Building Better School Infrastructure will help schools better access the resources they need to make sure that kids have a clean ride to school. We also urge Congress to swiftly approve President Biden's FY2023 Budget and enact the House-passed $555 billion investments in climate, jobs and justice investments to make our schools even safer and healthier."

"Equipping America's schools with cleaner, more efficient energy technologies will reduce pollution, improve health and lower operating costs. By making sure that schools have access to clean renewable energy, we can help ensure a better future for all of us. Schools with cutting-edge energy technologies can set an example in communities across America and help educate the next generation about steps we can take to clean up our air and preserve a healthy climate. Energy efficiency upgrades for our schools even have the added bonus of helping reduce these institutions' energy costs, meaning more precious education dollars can go toward teaching our kids rather than heating or cooling drafty buildings. Less pollution, healthier kids and better education outcomes. What's not to like? It's great to see the Biden administration advance this kind of win-win-win that communities across the country can tap into and reap tangible local benefits." [

""Climate change is a real issue for public school students and communities across Texas. From school evacuations and floods during Hurricane Harvey to heat waves that make classrooms too hot to learn, our outdated school facilities aren't ready for the climate crisis.
