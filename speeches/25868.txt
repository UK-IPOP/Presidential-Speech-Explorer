Dear Mr. President:
On behalf of the American people I thank you for your warm message of congratulations on the completion of the Apollo VIII Mission. Colonel Borman, Captain Lovell, and Major Anders join me in this expression of appreciation for your gratifying words.
As we come to the New Year, I also wish to tell you again of the warmth of my feeling for the people of France and of my abiding faith that the destiny of our two nations will remain closely linked in the years to come.
We have both faced serious problems this year in bearing our respective responsibilities. But standing back from these immediate problems, I trust you share with me the faith that the clouds of war are slowly beginning to lift from Southeast Asia and that by giving our full support to the Jarring Mission we can prevent them from enveloping the Middle East again.
In different ways, we each have borne governmental responsibilities for some thirty years. Recalling what our nations have been through in this time and the underlying prosperity and security they now enjoy, I would hope you, too, look with confidence on the future of our nations and the western family of which they are a part.
You have my very best wishes in carrying out the demanding tasks of leadership in the year ahead.

Sincerely,
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
[The Honorable Charles de Gaulle, President of France]
