My dear Miss Park:
I am glad to learn that the M. Carey Thomas Prize is to be awarded to Miss Jane Addares at Bryn Mawr College on May 2nd.
Miss Addams' distinguished achievements and her eminence in American life deserve every possible recognition, in addition to that which she already possesses in nationwide admiration and affection

Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
