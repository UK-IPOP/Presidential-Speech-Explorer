 the Congress by joint resolution of May 18, 1928 (45 Stat. 617), has authorized and requested the President of the United States to proclaim annually May 1 as Child Health Day; and
 the health and security of its children are essential to the wellbeing of the Nation; and
 it is advisable this year as we launch the social security program to encourage by every possible means the development of plans to promote maternal and child health and to extend child-welfare services:
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim and designate the first day of May of this year as Child Health Day, and do urge all agencies, public and private, concerned with the health and welfare of children, on this day to study the plans for Federal, State, and local cooperation in promoting the health and security of children, to note the extent to which those plans have so far been put into effect, and to make arrangements for carrying their benefits to the children in every county in the United States.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
 at the City of Washington this 13th day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixtieth.
FRANKLIN D ROOSEVELT
