Voters across the country and especially here in New Hampshire got to hear me say repeatedly the truth: that Barack Obama is trying to redefine the role of government in our country and America's role in the world.

And I think the evidence is — we raised more money in the first hour of that debate than any other debate. We feel great. Look, at the end of the day, New Hampshire voters are among the most serious voters in the country, If not the most serious. They look at the issues, the underlying factors and they want to know candidates that don't just know what they are just talking about but have a real plan and a real strategy moving forward and that is what we have built our campaign on. We feel great about the dividends that is going to pay here in about 24 hours.
