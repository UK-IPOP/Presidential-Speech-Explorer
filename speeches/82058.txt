President Bush and Brazilian President Luiz Incio Lula da Silva agreed to launch joint activities to improve HIV/AIDS treatment, care, and prevention in Lusophone (Portuguese-speaking) Africa.
President Bush stressed that the program will take advantage of Brazil's expertise in creating a national program for HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment (including an advanced program to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission), and benefit from the cultural and linguistic advantages that Brazil brings to programs in Lusophone Africa. Activities will initially take place in Mozambique, and will later expand to Angola.
Brazilian and American experts will work with their colleagues in Lusophone Africa in the following areas to support HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment programs:
Much of the work will be carried out through innovative "triangular twinning," or linkages between clinical and training institutions in the United States, Brazil, and Lusophone Africa to build capacity for health care and health research.
