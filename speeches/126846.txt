When I think about this election, I'm reminded of how the generations before us chose leaders of optimism and strength at critical moments in our history. Today we face a critical moment, and we have to decide what kind of country we want to leave our children and grandchildren. I believe we're lucky to have a next generation leader like Marco Rubio working to inspire and unite our people the way Ronald Reagan once did. I believe our Party would be remiss to pass up this opportunity to build a brighter, more conservative future for America. Marco's innovative vision will extend the American experiment into a new century and restore opportunity to the greatest nation on earth.
