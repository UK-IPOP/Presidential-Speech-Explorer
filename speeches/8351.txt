My dear Mr. Newlin:
It is with great interest that I note the work which the American Bar Association is doing in disseminating information relative to our National Constitution--its history and purposes.
Familiarity with, and respect for, this greatest of all charters of government among our fellow citizens is essential to our national welfare.
While I understand the Association's work along these lines is carried on throughout the year, it has come to my attention that special emphasis is given to these activities during that week which includes September 17th, designated as "Constitution Day".
You and your associates are rendering a splendid patriotic service in [p.292] this connection, and I desire to express my appreciation of this service, with the hope that it will be continued with increasing benefit to all concerned.
Yours faithfully,
HERBERT HOOVER
[Mr. Gurney E. Newlin, President, American Bar Association, Los Angeles, California]
