On Tuesday, September 29, 2020, the American Guild of Musical Artists (AGMA) endorsed Joe Biden for President. The organization cited President Trump's anti-union and anti-worker approach to stacking the courts and his mission to undermine the protections American workers deserve. Additionally, the union lauded Biden's long career of standing "shoulder to shoulder" with unions and declared that it is time to restore "empathy and dignity to the White House." 






In its 84 years, the American Guild of Musical Artists (AGMA) has never endorsed a presidential candidate â€” but that all changed today. The AGMA Board of Governors voted on Tuesday, September 29 to endorse Joseph Biden and Kamala Harris for President and Vice President of the United States.

"President Trump has nominated anti-union and anti-worker judges at every level of the federal judiciary, including to the Supreme Court, resulting in judicial opinions that have attacked and undermined the legal status and protections of unions in the United States," reads a part of the 
 that was presented and approved by the AGMA Board of Governors in support of endorsing Joe Biden as President.

This endorsement comes after careful consideration to break AGMA's longstanding tradition of not endorsing political candidates, and after AGMA members across the country expressed their hope that the union endorses Joseph Biden for President and Kamala Harris for Vice President.

"Joseph Biden has always stood shoulder-to-shoulder with unions. It is time to restore empathy and dignity to the White House," said Ray Menard, AGMA President. "AGMA is proud to endorse Vice President Biden and Senator Harris."

Within the next calendar year, the AGMA Board of Governors will send a non-binding referendum to the membership, asking them to advise as to whether AGMA should make political endorsements in the future.

 National unions representing a range of other workers and professions have also endorsed Biden, including:
