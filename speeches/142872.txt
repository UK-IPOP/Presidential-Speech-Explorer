Pool Reports by 
, 
Good morning from the White House where it is cloudy, a bit over 40 degrees, and getting warmer. I'll be your print pooler for today.
Pool received COVID testing shortly after 10am. President Trump has no public events scheduled, but we've received the now-traditional assurance he is very busy.
Will pass along any updates.
Confirming that we have not had any updates to the schedule. White House remains quiet, aside from a brief scramble from photographers to capture Biden/Harris inauguration signage going up in view of the White House.
Lunch lid expected relatively soon.
Following an uneventful afternoon, the White House called a travel/photo lid at 7:09 pm.
Enjoy your evening, everyone. Stay safe and healthy.
