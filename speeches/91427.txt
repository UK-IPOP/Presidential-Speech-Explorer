 "On Iraq, Romney asserted his support for President Bush and the current troop surge. He said he wouldn't disclose alternative plans for Baghdad until he's convinced this surge isn't working. 'I won't lay out 'Plan B,' because I want 'Plan A' to work,' he said." (Tim Gallager, "Romney Preaches Military Might," 
, 7/23/07)
 "All Americans want U.S. troops to come home as soon as possible. But walking away now or dividing Iraq up into parts and walking away later would present grave risks to the United States and the world. Iran could seize the Shiite south, al Qaeda could dominate the Sunni west, and Kurdish nationalism could destabilize the border with Turkey. A regional conflict could ensue, perhaps even requiring the return of U.S. troops under far worse circumstances." (Governor Mitt Romney, "Rising To A New Generation Of Global Challenges," 
, July/August 2007)
 "There is no guarantee that the new strategy pursued by General Petraeus will ultimately succeed, but the stakes are too high and the potential fallout too great to deny our military leaders and troops on the ground the resources and the time needed to give it an opportunity to succeed." (Governor Mitt Romney, "Rising To A New Generation Of Global Challenges," 
, July/August 2007)
 "'At a time when American families and individuals are making a surge of sacrifice to support this troop surge, I think it's time for American citizens and politicians to make a surge of support,' Romney said Wednesday in Pelham, N.H., a comment he repeated throughout the day."

 "There's no question: It's essential for America to show that we are committed to success in Iraq. Our men and women are the bravest and most patriotic in the world, that are over there fighting. We deserve to give them the kind of support they need to make this mission successful." (Fox News, Republican Presidential Candidate Debate, Durham, NH, 9/5/07)
 "A father's concern about U.S. support for the military surge in Iraq has prompted Republican Mitt Romney to both make a $25,000 donation to a variety of military support agencies and urge Americans to engage in a similar display of patriotism. The money will be divided between USO Care Packages, the Fisher House, A Soldiers Wish List, Packages from Home, Operation Thank You, Operation Shoebox and America Supports You. Links to each site have been placed on Romney's presidential campaign Web site,

 '"He has made a number of statements over the years that have not proved to be factual,' said Harry Reid, the Democratic majority Senate leader. Mr. Reid predicted the assessments of Gen Petraeus and Mr. Crocker would 'pass through the White House spin machine, where facts are often ignored or twisted and intelligence is cherry picked.'" (Andrew Ward And Ed Luce, "Democrats Cast Doubts On Petraeus," 
, 9/9/07)
 "Former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards said he is concerned the Petraeus report 'will be basically a sales job by the White House, that it'll be a PR document.' He said Congress should use its power to fund the war to insist on a withdrawal timetable." (Nedra Pickler, "Dems Agree On Iraq, Immigration,"

 SEN. OBAMA: "And the president now is trying to present an argument that somehow because there has been some impact as a consequence of 30,000 troops in Baghdad, that that has brought about any movement on the political front. At this point, I think everybody is aware there will be no military solution to what's happening in Iraq. The question is, are we going to be able to bring about a political accommodation?"

 "'I really respect him, but I think he's dead flat wrong,' Mr. Biden said when asked about Gen. Petraeus' expected recommendations. 'I will insist on a firm beginning to withdraw the troops, and I will insist on a target date to get American combat forces out.'" (Eric Pfeiffer, "Democrats Doubt Petraeus' Impartiality," 
, 9/10/07)
 "MoveOn.org, a leading antiwar group, will be even more critical in a full-page advertisement to run today in the New York Times, describing Petraeus as 'General Betray Us' and a 'military man constantly at war with the facts.'"
