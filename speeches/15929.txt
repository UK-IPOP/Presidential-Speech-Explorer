I AM grateful for your message and hasten to assure you that I shall find strength and courage in your brave words. The wholehearted pledge of support which you give will be a source of inspiration and fortitude as we gird ourselves for the difficult tasks ahead. We have taken our stand on the side of Korea and our pledge of faith to that nation is a witness to all the world that we champion liberty wherever the tyranny of communism is the aggressor.
HARRY S. TRUMAN
[Honorable Thomas E. Dewey, Governor of New York, Albany, New York]
