"When President Obama declared that Americans didn't build their businesses, he wasn't saying anything extraordinary — he was just saying what he actually believed. After three and a half years of liberal policies that have grown the size of government, President Obama's record is clear. We tried it his way, and middle-class Americans have paid the price. Our country deserves a new direction — and a president who doesn't devalue hard work and entrepreneurship." —Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 OBAMA: "Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen. The Internet didn't get invented on its own. Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet." (President Barack Obama,

 "The numbers are staggering.  The ranks of the long-term unemployed swelled last month from 5.1 million to 5.4 million, and those individuals now account for 42.8% of the unemployed.  Meanwhile, the average length of time the unemployed have spent out of work has climbed steadily higher — and older Americans have been the hardest hit."
