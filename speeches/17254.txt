Mr. President:
I am particularly happy to act as the agent of the American people in receiving from your hands, on behalf of the Italian people, this replica of the art of antiquity, together with objects which you did not mention--the column and the beautiful capital on top of it that I see just outside the enclosure.
I assure you that all America will be extremely gratified by your action, not only because of their interest in ancient arts, and in modern art, but because of their understanding that this gift comes from the affection and the sense of relationship on the part of the Italian people to our own. As you know, we have many millions of citizens of Italian derivation. They will be, I think, extremely proud that you brought this gift to our people, and all the rest of us will take a tremendous satisfaction that it has been handed over in the hands of one who is a militant leader for democracy and human values in this world of today.
Thank you very much.
