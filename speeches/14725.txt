 the war has entered a decisive stage requiring the fullest measure of individual sacrifice;
 the American National Red Cross is an auxiliary to the United States armed forces and, as such, is providing indispensable service to our troops throughout the world as well as to their families at home;
 these wartime activities, including the collection of life-saving blood for the wounded, recreation work in military hospitals, provision of aid to families of servicemen, shipment of food parcels to prisoners of war, production of surgical dressings, operation of overseas clubs and recreation centers, and recruitment of Army and Navy nurses, all combine to save countless lives, restore hope, and provide comfort for our fighting men;
, through its vast network of local chapters, this agency of our people simultaneously conducts an extensive program of training and community service, while continuing with traditional efficiency to lessen the distress of those overwhelmed by disaster; and
 this agency is wholly dependent upon individual support and personal participation and is issuing its 1944 appeal to the entire citizenship for a minimum War Fund of $200,000,000;
, President of the United States of America and President of the American National Red Cross, do hereby designate the month beginning March 1, 1944 as "Red Cross Month" and earnestly beseech my fellow Americans to observe it by opening their hearts to this humanitarian appeal in order that we may keep the Red Cross at the side of our fighting men and their dependents in their hour of greatest need.
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
 at the city of Washington this 19th day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-eighth.
FRANKLIN D ROOSEVELT
