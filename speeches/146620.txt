"For Michigan, and our nation, to be competitive we must invest in quality roads, bridges, water systems, and equitable access to transit. We also need to prepare for the future by investing in broadband, electric vehicle infrastructure, and cybersecurity. Unfortunately, Michigan has suffered the consequences of disinvestment in infrastructure. From Flint to Benton Harbor to Hamtramck to small towns across our great state, our communities have been the poster child for the case to eliminate lead services lines

"The President's Build Back Better and infrastructure bills are what this country needs, what families and cities desperately need," Mayor Norton said during the joint briefing.

The League of Wisconsin Municipalities urges our congressional delegation to support the bipartisan efforts to provide much-needed investments in our nation's infrastructure.
The annual 
 gave Wisconsin a C overall, but drinking water and wastewater rated only a C- and roads and transit received a D+. That's unacceptable.
As stated by the American Society of Civil Engineers in their analysis, "(p)ositive economic growth hinges on the availability and capacity of underlying systems that must support it, namely our infrastructure. Clean water (surface and drinking water), roads, bridges, transit systems, airports, water and sewer systems, dams, ports, and energy systems are categories of infrastructure that directly affect our ability to live, work, play and produce economic expansion and development. Infrastructure provides the foundation of our state's economy and is integral to preserving our high quality of life.
Much of Wisconsin's infrastructure requires capacity or maintenance upgrades or is reaching the end of its expected lifespan. You will see this reflected in Wisconsin's grades. The energy grid, transportation systems, sewers and drinking water systems of decades ago need upgrading to better prepare for security threats, larger storm events, increased use of renewable fuels and a changing population."
