The Administration opposes H.R. 4568, because:


— the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation has always been an entirely domestic agency without any international expertise or responsibility; and

— it would be detrimental to sound and coordinated management of foreign policy to grant Interior or the Advisory Council broad and duplicative international authority, especially without requiring specific approval of the State Department or AID as appropriate.
