CABLE DISPATCHES set forth that the London Daily Herald has announced that President Hoover is considering a proposal to call a world conference to deal with world trade. The announcement is erroneous. The facts are these: The Herald telephoned the White House yesterday asking that the President comment on its editorial advocating such a conference. I said that there was no comment to be made here. The Herald asked if the editorial would be considered. I replied that if the American press carried the editorial it would be read. That was the extent of the telephone conversation.
