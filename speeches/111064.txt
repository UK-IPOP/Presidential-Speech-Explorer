"After nearly four years in office, middle-class Americans aren't better off under President Obama, with fewer jobs, lower incomes, and increased poverty – so he's turned to a president whose record he can tout. But from 20 million new jobs to historic welfare reforms, President Clinton has a record President Obama simply can't match. Americans deserve a president willing to run on his own accomplishments, and not the record of a predecessor." – Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 "Democrats and Republicans alike should be distressed by President Barack Obama's disregard for constitutional limits on his authority. The president's flouting of the separation of powers risks turning this country into something other than a representative democracy. Congress should move in a bipartisan rebuke of Obama's overreach before he neuters that institution. In a blatant challenge to the legislative branch, Obama by executive order tossed out the Clinton-era welfare reform that required able-bodied aid recipients to work, saying the federal government will no longer enforce the law."

 "Today, I have signed into law H.R. 3734, the 'Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996.' While far from perfect, this legislation provides an historic opportunity to end welfare as we know it and transform our broken welfare system by promoting the fundamental values of work, responsibility, and family. This Act honors my basic principles of real welfare reform. It requires work of welfare recipients, limits the time they can stay on welfare, and provides child care and health care to help them make the move from welfare to work."

 "In January 2009, the month President Obama entered the Oval Office and shortly before he signed his stimulus spending bill, median household income was $54,983. By June 2012, it had tumbled to $50,964, adjusted for inflation. (See the chart nearby.) That's $4,019 in lost real income, a little less than a month's income every year." (Editorial, "Negative $4,019,"

 "The median household income increased during the two terms of Clinton (by 14 per cent, as we'll see in more detail below), Ronald Reagan (8.1 per cent), and Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford (3.9 per cent). ... Under Clinton, the median income increased 14 per cent."  (Ronald Brownstein, "Closing The Book On The Bush Legacy,"
