The Clinton campaign today announced its Virginia Hispanic Leadership Council, comprised of community leaders from across the state who are already mobilizing grassroots support for Hillary leading up to Virginia's February 12th primary.
"Latinos in Virginia know that Hillary Clinton has the strength and experience to create the real change America needs," said Carlos Del Toro, Chair of the Virginia Hispanic Leadership Council. "Hillary will fight for us day in and day out - whether it's providing health care for every single American, or returning our troops from Iraq safely and soundly, or fixing our economy on day one. Hillary will be a President that will worry for the wellbeing of our families," Del Toro added.
"Hillary Clinton is our friend. She has been committed to the issues that are important to Latino families for 35 years," said Rita Aguilar, Co-chair of the Council. "Latinos appreciate her hard work and her ability to bring solutions to the challenges facing our community and our country."
"I am very excited about receiving the support from these community leaders," said Hillary Clinton. "The Hispanic community has been key for our campaign, and it will play a key role in the February 12th primary. I look forward to working with them to help put our country back on track."
