"This campaign will be about President Obama's record in office — and nowhere is that record of failure more clear than in the Hispanic community. After promising to fix America's economic hardships in 2008, President Obama's failed policies have left millions of Hispanics without jobs and millions more in poverty." —Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson
 OBAMA: "More Americans are out of work, and have mortgages they can't pay, and cars they can't afford to drive, and wonder how they'll ever afford to retire. And we've all seen the statistics - we all know the Hispanic community has been especially hard hit. Now, we didn't get here by accident." (Sen. Barack Obama,

 OBAMA: "This election is about the 45 million Americans who don't have health care - one in three Hispanics - and about the small business owners who can barely stay afloat because of rising health care costs. They're counting on us to guarantee health care for anyone who needs it and make it affordable for anyone who wants it. That's what I'll do as President." (Sen. Barack Obama,
