 So this is a 5-year lobbying ban. And this is all of the people—most of the people standing behind me will not be able to go to work—[
]—or do anything adverse to our wonderful country. Okay, 5-year ban. It's a 2-year ban now, and it's got—full of loopholes. This is a 5-year ban, so you have one last chance to get out. [
] Does anybody want to get out? Good. I had a feeling you were going to say that.

This was something—the 5-year ban—that I've been talking about a lot on the campaign trail, and we are now putting it into effect.

. National Security Council.

. This is the organization of the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council. You know pretty much what it represents. It represents a lot and also a lot of efficiency and, I think, a lot of additional safety. People have been talking about doing this for a long time, like, many years.

Okay. Here, Mr. Vice President.

. Thank you, Mr. President.

. This is the plan to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, in other words, ISIS. I think it's going to be very successful.

Okay, that's big stuff. Have a good weekend.



Is your Government prepared to implement the immigration Executive order that you issued yesterday?

 Totally.

And is it a Muslim ban?

 Totally. It's not a Muslim ban, but we are totally prepared. It's working out very nicely. You see it at the airports; you see it all over. It's working out very nicely. And we're going to have a very, very strict ban, and we're going to have extreme vetting, which we should have had in this country for many years.

Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much.
