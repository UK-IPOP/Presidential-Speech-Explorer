In an explosive interview, Tony Bobulinski, a former business associate of Hunter Biden, detailed how he met with Joe Biden, his brother Jim, and his son Hunter regarding a lucrative financial deal with a Chinese energy company in 2017.

In addition to his firsthand story, Bobulinski provided a tape recording, texts, emails, and business records as supporting evidence for his claims about the Biden family's systematic use of Joe Biden's power and position to enrich themselves.

The former vice president was intimately involved in Hunter's schemes, according to Bobulinski, leading the Navy veteran to conclude that "Joe Biden and the Biden family are compromised."
