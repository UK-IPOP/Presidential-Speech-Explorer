I BELIEVE this project can offer badly needed health and housing care for the elderly and the poor in Washington. I hope it will serve as an example for other cities which lack adequate health care in poverty areas.
The National Medical Association deserves great credit for taking the lead in sponsoring this project. It is an example of how concerned citizens in a voluntary association can work with government to solve urgent problems.
