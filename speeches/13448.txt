His Majesty George H King of Hellenes Athens
I wish to extend you my most heartfelt sympathy on the sad occasion of the sudden death of His Excellency Cimon Diamantopoulos. He was both a worthy representative of your valiant people and a greatly loved friend of this country. I feel a sense of personal loss in his passing.
HARRY S. TRUMAN
