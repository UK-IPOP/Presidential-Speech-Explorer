"Millions of middle-class Americans are struggling in the Obama economy and there's no relief in sight. After three and a half years, the results of President Obama's policies are clear: businesses aren't hiring, poverty is climbing, and manufacturing is weakening. Middle-class Americans need a new direction, and a new president who can get our economy back on track." — Andrea Saul, Romney Campaign Spokesperson

 "Economic forecasts are coming down all over Wall Street: Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank both cut forecasts of second-quarter growth to just over 1%. Companies from chipmaker Intel to Morgan Stanley have missed or lowered earnings forecasts — 99 companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 lowered second-quarter projections.

 "On Wednesday, a survey by the Fed said hiring was 'tepid' in most of its districts in June and early July. And manufacturing weakened in most regions. Retail sales fell in June for the third straight month, the government said this week. That led many economists to downgrade their estimates for growth in the April-June quarter. Many think it will be even slower than the first quarter's scant 1.9 percent annual pace." (Christopher Rugaber, "Unemployment Rates Rose In 27 US States In June"
