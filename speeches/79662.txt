Presidents Bush and Kwasniewski have agreed that the United States and Poland will develop a closer military relationship, one that will benefit both countries. The United States and Poland will establish a Military Cooperation Working Group to select specific areas for robust cooperation.
This initiative reflects the strategic importance of the Polish-American relationship and Poland's intention to transform its military into a 21st Century force -- much like the United States is transforming its own forces.
The United States and Poland will benefit from closer military cooperation. This cooperation, moreover, will demonstrate to other NATO Allies and nations aspiring to join the Alliance the possibilities and benefits of modernizing and transforming defense capabilities.
Aspects of the initiative could include, but are not limited to, the following:
The first meeting of the Military Cooperation Working Group on Transformation will establish a "short list" of near-term projects and opportunities and discuss future goals.
