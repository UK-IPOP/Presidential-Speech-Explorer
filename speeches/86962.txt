 "Rising enrollment in the new Medicare drug benefit may be helping thousands of older Minnesotans, but it also has cut sharply into low-cost Canadian drug sales through a state-operated website, two reports indicate. The reports are the latest indication that millions of Americans appear to be switching from Canada to Medicare for their drugs. While enrollment in the Medicare benefit rose 9 percent in the past month, the government said Thursday, Canadian drug sales through the Minnesota RxConnect program plunged 52 percent in March."

 According to guidance from the HHS Inspector General and CMS, patient assistance programs sponsored by drug manufacturers may operate outside of the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit, without violating the anti-kickback statute or any other program requirements. This means that no pharmaceutical manufacturers need to end their assistance programs for people with Medicare drug coverage. Pharmaceutical assistance programs may continue to provide free or discounted drugs to financially needy Medicare Part D enrollees outside of the Medicare drug benefit. See 
 for details.
 "It is simply unacceptable for any pharmaceutical company to use the launch of the new Medicare prescription drug benefit as an excuse to limit their [PAPs] as of May 15, particularly since there is now clear legal guidance from the OIG on ways to operate these programs."

 On average, Medicare will pay for more than 95 percent of the costs of prescription drugs for low-income seniors.
 Last fall, millions of applications for extra help were mailed to many low-income seniors and Americans with disabilities. Applications are also available at locations around the country, including over 30,000 pharmacies, or through the Social Security Administration by visiting 
, or calling 1-800-772-1213 (TTY 1-800-325-0778), or going to any Social Security office. There is no cost or obligation to apply for extra help, and no financial documents or complicated records are required. Everyone who thinks they may qualify should apply.
 "They are poor or near-poor, old, disabled or both. Some have cancer or AIDS, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, spinal cord injuries or multiple sclerosis." (Richard Wolf and Julie Appleby, "Tough Choices Can Be Side Effects Of Medicare Plan,"

 "The Bush administration issued a new policy on Wednesday that protects Medicare beneficiaries against the sudden loss of coverage for drugs they are taking under the prescription-drug program. ... Dr. Mark McClellan, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, summarized the policy this way: 'In general, a plan cannot change your coverage for the drugs you are using during the year. The stability of drug formularies is extremely important for many of our beneficiaries.'" (Robert Pear, "New Drug Rule Protects Medicare Beneficiaries," 
 , 4/27/06 )
 The six classes are: chemotherapy, HIV/AIDS, anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, anti-convulsant agents and immunosuppressants. CMS requires plans to cover all drugs in these classes.
 By law, these appeals and exception requests must be handled within 72 hours, or 24 hours in the case of a life-threatening event.
 Wait times on 1-800-MEDICARE average less than two minutes, and plans have similar call wait times.

 That's what insurance is about: seniors pay a little more now but get peace of mind. About one in six beneficiaries do not take any drugs.
 "Ida Solo of Richardson takes only two prescriptions, so she wasn't sure she'd sign up for Medicare's new drug coverage. For weeks, Ms. Solo wondered whether she'd get her money's worth. Finally, she joined a Humana plan for $14.13 a month. What persuaded her to enroll was the peace of mind she'd have. If she ever fell ill, her prescription costs would be covered. 'I bought it for when I get older,' she said. Ms. Solo turned 102 last month." (Bob Moos, "Time To Sign Up,"

 If enrollment rates continue at the current pace, the government may enroll 90 percent of the estimated 43 million eligible seniors by the May 15 deadline.
 As of March 23, there were 11 million seniors with retiree coverage partially subsidized by the federal government and 5.8 million seniors were auto-enrolled. This month, CMS is auto enrolling about 1 million low income seniors that have not picked a plan but qualify for extra help. There are about 6 million people who don't need to sign up because they have other coverage (i.e., they are covered by VA, Indian Health, or they are still working).
 "The deadline is forcing seniors – and their adult children – to act. Note that one in eight taxpayers file in the week before April 15. … Congress rejected an extension in February. With almost a month to go, it should resist the temptation to change its mind." (Editorial, "Views Of Medicare Plan Shift," 
 , 4/17/06 )
 "Also, there's plenty of help available to make a decision now. Social service agencies, state insurance departments and pharmacies are helping seniors navigate the system. More than 1,000 enrollment seminars are held each week." (Editorial, "Views Of Medicare Plan Shift," 
 , 4/17/06 )
