I couldn't be more excited to announce my support for Marco Rubio for President of the United States. It has become abundantly clear that Marco Rubio is the only conservative who can unite the Republican Party and beat Hillary Clinton in November. As a business owner and community leader who cares deeply about the future of my state and my country, I am urging my fellow Nevadans to support the next generation of conservative leadership and to caucus for Marco Rubio on Tuesday, February, 23rd.
