The Clinton campaign today released its Kansas Steering Committee, made up of community leaders from across the state who will mobilize grassroots support for Hillary leading up to Kansas's February 5th caucus. Capitalizing on the momentum from Tuesday's victory in the New Hampshire Primary, the campaign is ready to compete for every vote in Kansas.
As a caucus state, the organizational and grassroots support included in this steering committee will allow the campaign to compete for votes and delegates in every corner of the state.
"I am so encouraged by the support I have of community leaders and activists across Kansas," Clinton said. "With their help, we can bring our message of change throughout Kansas and the nation."
