The Rubio campaign released Marco and Jeanette Rubio's joint federal tax returns from 2010 to 2014. The Rubios' income has included earnings from employment with the U.S. Senate and Florida International University, Marco's legal work, Marco's books, and Jeanette's business.

There is no doubt the Rubio family has come a long way from the days when their largest monthly expense was a check to Sallie Mae and checks were sent in the mail to pay bills with the hope the payment did not arrive before the next paycheck was deposited into their account. Today, the Rubios have a single debt: the mortgage on their family home. They are able to send their four children to private Christian schools in Miami, and have created college savings accounts for each child.

The financial priority in Marco's life is to provide his four children with a good home, a quality education, and a safe and happy upbringing. As he wrote in his book,


The mark I make in this world will not be decided by how much money I make or how many titles I attain. Rather, the greatest mark I can leave is the one I will make as a father and a husband.
