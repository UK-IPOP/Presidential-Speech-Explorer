U.S. SENATE,

COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS,

September 1, 1960
Mr. SIMON MALLEY,

420 East 56th St.,

New York 22, NY
DEAR MR. MALLEY: Thank you for your letter. I want to assure you that my overall position on the Algerian question has not changed, and I feel it is properly a matter of International concern, particularly when negotiations are not proceeding in good faith. It is my feeling that General De Gaulle at heart does desire to pursue a more liberal policy in Algeria than his predecessors, but I do not think that it is sufficient to say that it therefore becomes exclusively a French problem.
Let me say that I have sent Governor Harriman to West and Central Africa on a factfinding mission, and he is not concerning himself directly with the Algerian problem. Though Algeria obviously has implications throughout Africa, I can assure you that Governor Harriman is proceeding responsibly and intelligently in appraising conditions and in his discussions with African leaders.
With every good wish, I am
Sincerely,
JOHN F. KENNEDY.
