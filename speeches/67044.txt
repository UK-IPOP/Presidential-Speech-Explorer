 President Clinton, what are the prospects for common ground on this NATO issue?
 I'm looking forward to the meeting. I think we'll work something out; I hope we will. We have had 11 meetings. We've worked hard together, and I'm glad to see President Yeltsin looking so fit and well.
 How are you doing, President Clinton?
 Great.
