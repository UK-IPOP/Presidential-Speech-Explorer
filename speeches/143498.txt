Yesterday, the Biden Administration 
 a set of historic actions across six agencies to phase down super-polluting hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), bolster the competitiveness of American industries, and maintain and create hundreds of thousands of good-paying, union jobs across the country. And, the Environmental Protection Agency released a 
 to implement the bipartisan American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act and phase down the production and consumption of HFCs by 85% below baseline levels within the next 15 years.
This landmark climate protection program is expected to provide cumulative benefits of $272 billion and reduce emissions by 4.5 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent by 2050—equal to nearly three years of U.S. power sector emissions at 2019 levels.
Leaders from across the country, environmental organizations and advocates, and business and manufacturing leaders applauded President Biden's leadership on reducing climate pollution from HFCs and supporting U.S. industries and workers.
 "We applaud the EPA for finalizing a balanced HFC Allocation Rule on time, a critical step in phasing down hydrofluorocarbons over the next fifteen years and a win-win for both the climate and the economy. The plan allows U.S. manufacturers to maintain a technological advantage over foreign competitors in the global marketplace in supporting an appropriate transition, while creating thousands of new and good paying jobs in the U.S. When aligned with international efforts, this phasedown will help avoid up to 0.5 degrees Celsius rise in temperature, important to meeting global climate ambitions."

 "This rule is the critical first milestone in the implementation of the AIM Act, which became law in December 2020. We applaud the EPA and the entire Biden Administration for its effort to meet the first statutory deadline for its promulgation." [
, 9/23/21]
 "We look forward to reviewing the final allocation rule in full detail and working with EPA to achieve a smooth phasedown as it also initiates efforts on user sector rules and refrigerant management." [
, 9/23/21]
 "AHRI and its member manufacturers that produce and use hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants are pleased that the EPA finalized the allocation rule on time, as required by the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act. Predictability is a very important aspect of the manufacturing process, and this timely rule ensures that our member companies are aware of this regulatory terrain for the coming years. This rule is a critical step in the 15-year industry-supported process of phasing down HFCs and represents a win for both the climate and the American economy. We are hopeful that the administration will soon submit the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol – the treaty that underpins the AIM Act – to the United States Senate and continue the process of putting the United States on record with the majority of the world's nations in support of this global phase down." [

 "Today marks an important leap forward in our efforts to tackle the climate crisis and kick start our economy. Putting the AIM Act into action will create good-paying jobs for the American people and help position our nation for a brighter future. This is a slam dunk, plain and simple: phasing down HFCs will support American leadership in manufacturing and innovation, bring down global temperatures, strengthen our economy, and help save our planet. Now that the Biden administration is putting the AIM Act into action, there's no reason to delay ratification of the Kigali Amendment. Let's join the rest of the world as we phase down hydrofluorocarbons and lead this new era of climate action." [

 "Cutting superpollutant HFCs is a win-win for our economy and for our communities. Today's announcement from @POTUS Biden will create $272 billion in benefits for American businesses and workers, all while protecting families from pollution. Drawing down the use of HFCs was one of the recommendations in our #SolvingTheClimateCrisis Action Plan. @HouseDemocrats will keep working alongside President Biden to protect American families and unleash the clean energy economy." [
, 9/23/21]
 "Phasing out HFCs is a vital step in addressing climate change. The AIM Act I authored slashes greenhouse gas emissions while bolstering our manufacturing industry & driving American competitiveness. Thanks @EPAMichaelRegan for ensuring the law's successful implementation!" [
, 9/23/21]
"Great news — the EPA has released its final rule to implement the AIM Act, a Senate plan to cut Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by 85% by 2036. This directive — combined with similar actions by 125 other nations — is key to the overall strategy to slow climate change." [
, 9/23/21]
"I applaud the Biden administration for taking strong action against hydrofluorocarbons. These greenhouse gases are less common but more potent than carbon dioxide. In May, @SenAlexPadilla and I encouraged the administration to use California's rules as a national model, and this is a good step in that direction. I look forward to more action decreasing the use of these harmful gases." [
, 9/23/21]
"HFCs are superheating our planet. I applaud President Biden's actions to cut down these super-pollutants. We must use this action as a springboard and continue to push for the ambitious solutions we need to combat the climate crisis by passing the budget reconciliation bill." [

 "This is enormously important from a direct climate impact and also because it sends a strong signal internationally in advance of COP26." [Tweet, 9/23/21]
"Today @EPAMichaelRegan signed a rule to reduce emissions of hydrofluorocarbons by 85% over 15 years. These potent, harmful pollutants greatly contribute to the warming of our climate. I'm grateful to @POTUS & @EPA for taking action to protect our environment and our industries." [
, 9/23/21]
 "This @EPA rule will cut the use & production of HFCs – extremely potent greenhouse gases – in the U.S. by 85% over the next 15 years, implementing a law we passed in Congress last year. This will make a huge difference in fighting the climate crisis." [
, 9/23/21]
 "Proud to work in @EnergyCommerce on a new law targeting reducing hydrofluorocarbons. Now @POTUS and @EPA are using new authority to reduce this dangerous greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change at a rate thousands of times more than CO2." [
, 9/23/21]
 "I'm glad to see this. It's one of many steps we must take to drastically reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. #ClimateAction" [
, 9/23/21]
 "I co-introduced the AIM Act in 2020 to phase down hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)—powerful heat-trapping chemicals. Today, @WhiteHouse & @EPA revealed plans to implement the bill. These actions are some of the most consequential steps we can take to combat the climate crisis. Over the years, I've made it a priority to tackle these harmful substances and eliminate them from our atmosphere. I'm thrilled to see how this legislation will make a difference for generations to come. Let's keep the momentum going." [

 "We have repeatedly seen how environmental crime can fundamentally undermine the best efforts to protect our climate. This is a groundbreaking effort to fight crime in climate pollutants by combining the latest technology with the broad cooperation necessary to deliver on U.S. climate goals." [
, 9/23/21]
"The EPA is moving fast to phase down production and import of super-polluting HFCs. This meets the central requirement of the bipartisan AIM Act, which passed last year with broad support from industry, states, and environmental advocates. Moving from HFCs to climate-friendlier alternatives is an important part of President Biden's plan to meet the climate crisis by cutting America's heat-trapping emissions at least in half by 2030—with big benefits for jobs, our health and a safer future." [
, 9/23/21]
 "The Biden Administration's new rules to phase down hydrofluorocarbons could not come soon enough. Hydroflourocarbons are thousands of times more potent as a warming agent than carbon dioxide, so replacing these with more climate-friendly alternatives is essential for the United States to achieving its climate goals. These new rules bring U.S. policy in line with the requirements of the Kigali Amendment, an international agreement joined by more than 120 countries to reduce the consumption and use of these powerful pollutants. The phasedown is supported by leading American businesses and could result in thousands of good-paying jobs and enhance the competitiveness of American industry on the global stage. If all countries do their part to successfully phase-down hydroflourocarbons, these efforts alone could avoid up to half a degree Celsius of global warming by the end of this century." [
, 9/23/21]
 "This rule is hugely beneficial for both the climate and American businesses. Phasing out these superpollutants is expected to help avoid nearly $300 billion dollars' worth of climate damages, and U.S. companies are projected to profit from the phasedown program as demand for domestically produced substitutes increases. The rule is a major milestone in U.S. policy since any meaningful strategy to tackle climate change must address for HFCs as well as other sources of climate pollution." [
, 9/23/21]
 "President Joe Biden and his administration took a major step forward today to address climate change. Left unchecked, the super-pollutants targeted by today's actions would have continued to aid in the destabilization of our climate with an intensity that is 1,000 times greater than carbon dioxide. We are facing a worldwide crisis, and that requires the kind of whole-of-government response that prioritizes public health, American competitiveness, and well-paying union jobs that we've seen from this administration. We cannot delay action on climate change any longer—the United States must lead the way in building a clean future." [
, 9/23/21]
 "Today brings another example of how the Biden-Harris administration is using their all of government approach to tackle climate change by slashing emissions of super-pollutant HFCs and driving innovation and clean tech jobs here in the U.S. This critical action, which implements the bipartisan American Innovation and Manufacturing Act enacted by Congress last year, will help protect those communities, often low wealth communities and communities of color, who are most vulnerable to the damaging impacts of climate change. From the 'code red for humanity' IPCC report to devastating extreme weather and long-standing environmental and racial injustice and economic inequality, it's never been more urgent or more important to act on climate. Congress needs to keep up the momentum by moving forward with the Build Back Better Act, which would put us on the path to reducing our emissions 50 percent by 2030, as science and justice require." [

 "The U.S. Climate Alliance welcomes the EPA's finalization of this rule to phase down highly-potent HFCs across the country. National standards will ensure all communities have access to higher quality products, and that we are giving U.S. industry the best opportunity to innovate and lead the global transition to HFC alternatives. Alliance states have been leading the charge in reducing HFC emissions in recent years and now have a strong federal partner in this push. It's a win for jobs, a win for our economy and it will help us achieve our bold state and federal climate goals." [
