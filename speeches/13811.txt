DURING THE WAR PERIOD, gardening further demonstrated its value to our people in many ways. The splendid response to the appeal for more home-produced food was an important factor in making it possible during the war for the people of this country to be better fed than before the war while supplying the best-fed fighting forces in the world and providing essential food supplies to our allies. The threat of starvation in many parts of the world and the urgent need for food from this country emphasize the importance of continued effort to add to our total food supply this year.
A continuing program of gardening will be of great benefit to our people. In addition to the contribution gardens make to better nutrition, their value in providing outdoor physical exercise, recreation and relaxation from the strain of modern life is widely recognized. The Department of Agriculture through a long-time garden program can do much to encourage more attractive home surroundings and improved community development, and can provide a large body of citizens with much needed assistance in home gardening.
