Quick overview: No big news here. Biden called into the Zoom meeting and a stock photo of the president appeared on the screen as he spoke.
The major thrust here is Biden acknowledges a resurgence of Covid and recognizes he needs faith leaders to urge skeptical communities to receive the vaccine and to not get too "cavalier" when traveling and abiding by Covid safety measures like mask-wearing.
"They're going to listen to your words, more than they are me, as president of the United States " Biden told the leaders they could talk to their congregations "about what we have to do, what's available and not to be fearful, not to be fearful of getting the vaccine."
Biden also noted that because he and family had been vaccinated he may be able to see family members on Easter.
More quotes TK
Here are Biden remarks to faith leaders.
This is run through Otter and tried to go through and fix some. If anyone needs something specific, please let me know.
Some highlights of Biden remarks:
"The point I'm trying to make is for the faith community as faith community leaders, you've been critical partners to us in our COVID response.
We need you to spread the word, let people in our communities and your community know how important is to get everyone vaccinated when it's their turn, and soon they'll just be able to just line up and just get their name on a list.
And that's how we're going to defeat this virus and that's how we're going to come together again in our communities, in our houses of worship.
What I'm worried about now what the scientists are telling me, people are getting too cavalier with traveling a great deal, gathering in larger crowds and people aren't wearing their masks. Aren't on social distancing. Aren't washing their hands. And you've seen this spike.
"I think this is the Godly thing to do. Protect your brother and sister."

More TK
Your pooler is now at Psaki’s press briefing.
More precise quotes from Biden TK. I will in meantime tweet pics (they’re not great) from Cabinet meeting.
President Joe Biden's first Cabinet meeting was held in the East Room instead of the typical Cabinet meeting room to abide by Covid safety provisions. The Cabinet, as well as key staff members, sat at large tables arranged in a square formation.
Each person was seated with an empty chair separating them from the next. Cabinet members were each wearing a mask. Biden was not wearing a mask as he made opening remarks.
The president was seated with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to his left and Secretary of State Antony Blinken to his right. Vice President Kamala Harris was sitting opposite Biden, facing him.

Biden opened by referencing his American Jobs rollout in Pittsburgh then noted he was asking five Cabinet members to take "special responsibility" to "engage the public on selling the plan," working with senior White House officials and Congress.
He said that would be a subject of the meeting as well as a directive from him to Cabinet members on spending and his "commitment to Buy American to make sure that they're spending on American made goods, American corporations and American employees."
"Today I'm directing every member of the Cabinet, I mean specifically every one of them, to take a hard look at their agency spending and make sure it abides by my Buy American standards."
Biden added he'd ask each Cabinet member to report back to him at the next meeting.
He did not take questions despite a couple shouted out. "Mr. President, at the border!" Fox's Peter Doocy attempted, to no avail.
The White House tells your pooler that the Cabinet meeting ended at about 3:40 p.m .. It was about two hours, per White House.
The White House called a lid at 4:10 p.m.
Thanks all!
