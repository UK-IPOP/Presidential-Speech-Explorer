"President Obama's energy policies have made life more difficult for middle-class families, increasing costs and killing jobs. But instead of owning up to their policies, the President's advisers are on defense, offering misleading statistics and imaginary claims. The Romney Plan for a Stronger Middle Class will deliver more jobs and higher take-home pay, while finally putting the nation on a path to energy independence by 2020." – Amanda Henneberg, Romney Campaign Spokesperson

CARNEY: "Well I don't mean that every single project imaginable that would require some sort of federal approval has necessarily but I mean every form of energy has enjoyed the very aggressive support of this Administration. That includes nuclear, and wind, and solar and bio fuels, and as you know oil and gas." (

 TAPPER: "Why do you and the President continue to refer to it as an all of the above energy approach when there are certain components Republicans are pushing for that you reject such as the Keystone Pipeline or other things..." CARNEY: "Well first of all the Keystone Pipeline is a process. We haven't rejected it. There's a process underway at the State Department that was delayed for two reasons, first because people were concerned about, folks in Nebraska including the Republican governor because of the original route and because of Congress's insistence in including it as part of the payroll tax extension. That is a specific issue." (
