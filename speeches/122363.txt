Alexandria, VA â€” Today, Lindsey Graham 2016 released a series of new digital ads highlighting Senator Graham's 33 years of military service and his extensive experience in international affairs.
The first ad, entitled "One," focuses on the depth of knowledge Senator Graham has that makes him uniquely qualified, in this field of candidates, to be Commander-in-Chief. The second ad, entitled "Bio," looks to the challenges the senator has overcome in life to highlight his understanding of the economic and security threats Americans are facing. 
In case you missed it, the Graham campaign released its first television ad on Monday, entitled "Make it Count," as well as a series of radio ads, featuring two-time New Hampshire Presidential Primary winner, Senator John McCain.

Lindsey Graham. Because the first job of any president is to keep us safe.

Served 33 years in the military.
Traveled 35 times to war zones in the Middle East.

Lindsey Graham. The one leader to keep your family, and America, safe and defeat our enemies abroad. Because in a dangerous world, experience matters.

I'm Lindsey Graham and I approve this message.
