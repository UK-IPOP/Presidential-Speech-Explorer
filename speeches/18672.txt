Dear Mr. President:
I am deeply distressed at the indications of hardship and suffering being undergone now by the people of your nation and have just issued the following public statement:
"The people of the United States are appalled at the disaster that has struck the friendly, hard-working people of Chile. Earthquakes, tidal waves, avalanches and volcanic eruptions have brought extremely serious personal casualties and heavy material damage that will take years to overcome.
"Many people in Chile are homeless, injured and poorly clothed. It is now winter in Chile. The disaster area is one of heavy rainfall. Hence the extent of personal suffering being experienced by Chileans is almost beyond comprehension.
"The United States Government is doing all it can to assist the Government of Chile and the Chilean people in this catastrophe.
"In addition, I urge all our people promptly to demonstrate once again the great generosity so characteristic of them. The Chileans need help of many kinds--medicine tents, clothing, food and other things. Cash contributions can be made to the American Red Cross. Contributions of material goods can be made through many voluntary organizations which, I am informed, are issuing local appeals. I have asked General Alfred M. Gruenther, President of the American Red Cross, to arrange for the coordination of this voluntary material assistance."
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
