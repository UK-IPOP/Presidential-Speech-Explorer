Thank you all very much. Well, Lew, thank you very much. Laura and I are thrilled to be here.

I appreciate the members of the press. I think you serve a very useful purpose, especially tonight. As you know, we're studying safe levels for arsenic in drinking water. [
] To base our decision on sound science, the scientists told us we needed to test the water glasses of about 3,000 people. [
] Thank you for participating. [
]

It's good to see so many Members of the Congress here, my fellow Texan Tom DeLay here at the head table. Lew asked me a little earlier if Tom ever smiled. I said, "I don't know. I've only known him 9 years." [
]

Senator Lieberman is here. We all know Joe is an Orthodox Jew, so he does no work from sundown Friday until sundown Saturday. This has so impressed me, I myself am thinking of converting—[
]—so I don't have nothing to do from sundown Saturday to sundown Friday. [
]

Most of you probably didn't know that I have a new book out. Some guy put together a collection of my wit and wisdom or, as he calls it, my accidental wit and wisdom. [
] But I'm kind of proud that my words are already in book form. So like other authors, I thought I'd read from it tonight. [
] It's like the thoughts of Chairman Mao, only with laughs and not in Chinese. [
]

Here's one from the book—and I actually said this. [
] "I know the human being and fish can coexist peacefully." [
] Now, that makes you stop and think. [
] Anyone can give you a coherent sentence, but something like this takes you into an entirely new dimension. [
]

Here's another: "I understand small-business growth; I was one." [
] You know, I love great literature. [
]

I actually said this in New Hampshire: "I appreciate preservation. It's what you do when you run for President. You've got to preserve." [
] I don't have the slightest idea what I was saying there. [
]

Or how about this one: "More and more of our imports come from overseas." [
]

Now, most people would say, in speaking of the economy, we ought to make the pie bigger. I, however, am on record saying, "We ought to make the pie higher." [
] It is a very complicated economic point I was making there. [
] But believe me, what this country needs is taller pie. [
]

And how about this for foreign policy vision: "When I was coming up, it was a dangerous world, and we knew exactly who the ‘they' were. It was ‘us' versus ‘them,' and it was clear who the ‘them' was." [
] "Today, we're not so sure who the ‘they' are, but we know they're there." [
]

John Ashcroft, by the way, attributes the way I talk to my religious fervor. In fact, the first time we met, he thought I was talking in tongues. [
]

Then there is my most famous statement: "Rarely is the question asked, is our children learning?" [
] Let us analyze that sentence for a moment. [
] If you're a stickler, you probably think the singular verb "is" should have been the plural "are." But if you read it closely, you'll see I'm using the intransitive plural subjunctive tense. [
] So the word "is" are correct. [
]

Finally, let's see you wordsmiths out there diagram this sentence: I said—this may sound a little west Texan to you— "but when I'm talking about myself and when he's talking about myself, all of us are talking about me." [
]

Now, ladies and gentlemen, you have to admit, in my sentences, I go where no man has gone before. [
]

But in closing, the way I see it is, I am a boon to the English language. I've coined new words, like "misunderstanding" and "Hispanically." [
] I've expanded the definition of words themselves, using "vulcanized" when I meant "polarized," "Grecians" when I meant "Greeks," "inebriating" when I meant "exhilarating"— [
]—and instead of "barriers and tariffs," I said "terriers and bariffs." [
]

And you know what? Life goes on. [
] My wife and my daughters still love me. [
] Our military still protects our shores. [
] Americans still get up and go to work. [
] People still go out and have fun, as we're doing tonight.

I don't think it's healthy to take yourself too seriously. But what I do take seriously is my responsibility as President to all the American people and to the office I hold. And that is what I came tonight to tell you.

Thank you for inviting me, and thank you for your "horspitality." [
