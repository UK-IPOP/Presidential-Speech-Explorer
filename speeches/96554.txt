 "The Arizona Republican indicted the entire federal court system for he sees as its embrace of judicial activism, calling the 'common and systematic abuse of our federal courts' the 'great exception' to a system of checks and balances in this country that otherwise works well." (Bret Hovell, "McCain Criticizes 'Activist Judges,'" ABC News, 5/6/08)
 "In his speech at Wake Forest University, McCain identified the battle over the proper role of the judiciary as 'one of the defining issues of this presidential election.' Defending the Constitution's separation of powers, he forcefully decried how the decades-long 'common and systematic abuse of our federal courts' by judicial activists has usurped the power of the American people to address policy questions through the democratic process." (Editorial, "McCain's Promise On Judges," National Review, 5/6/08)

 "Senator McCain's speech will be well-received by millions of Americans alarmed by activist judges who undermine the rule of law by legislating from the bench. We applaud Senator McCain for his support of federal judges who will apply the U.S. Constitution. He is correct in criticizing both federal judges who presume to 'make law instead of apply it' and the obstructionist Senate Democratic leaders who continue to deny hearings to well-qualified judicial nominees."

 "McCain has this much correct: we cannot restrain the federal government while the judiciary acts as a legislature. The very act of judicial activism of the kind supported by Obama, Clinton, and others puts more and more power into the federal government and away from the states and the people."

 (Klaus Marre, "McCain Lambastes Judicial Activism," The Hill, 5/6/08)
 "How radical was Obama's nay vote? His was one of only 22 votes in opposition to Roberts. Chris Dodd and Patty Murray voted to confirm Roberts, and yet Obama and Hillary Clinton voted against him. Getting to the left of Dodd and Murray takes some doing, and for a man who professes to be some kind of unifying force, the result proves him to be a hard-Left ideologue."
