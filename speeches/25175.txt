THE PRESIDENT takes a most serious view of the fact that police protection furnished the American Embassy in Moscow yesterday was wholly inadequate despite prior notification to the Soviet Government of an impending demonstration. The United States Government must insist that its diplomatic establishments and personnel be given the protection which is required by international law and custom and which is necessary for the conduct of diplomatic relations between states. Expressions of regret and compensation are no substitute for adequate protection.
