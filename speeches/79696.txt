The President today declared a major disaster exists in the Federated States of Micronesia and ordered Federal aid to supplement national and state recovery efforts in the area struck by Tropical Storm Chata'an, including flooding, mudslides and landslides on July 2-4, 2002.
The President's action makes Federal funding available to municipal governments in Chuuk State on a cost-sharing basis for debris removal and emergency protective measures, including direct Federal assistance, at 75 percent Federal funding.
Federal funding is also available on a cost-share basis for hazard mitigation measures.
Joe M. Allbaugh, Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), named William L. Carwile, III as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected area.
The Agency said that damage surveys are continuing and additional assistance and jurisdictions may be added after the assessments are completed.
