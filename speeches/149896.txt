President Biden remains focused on response and recovery efforts in the wake of Hurricane Fiona. The President has made clear that Puerto Rico officials, first responders, and all those impacted by the storm have the full support of the Federal Government. He approved an Emergency Declaration prior to landfall and immediately approved the Governor of Puerto Rico's request for a Major Disaster Declaration for Individual and Public Assistance. He has been in regular contact with Puerto Rico Governor Pierluisi and asked FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell to travel to the island as soon as the hurricane made landfall.
At a briefing in New York last week with the FEMA Administrator, the Governor of Puerto Rico, New York Governor Kathy Hochul, New York Mayor Eric Adams, and other Federal and local officials, President Biden announced additional financial support for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and pledged to support Puerto Rico in its recovery efforts in the weeks to come.
Consistent with the President's direction for a robust and well-coordinated Federal response, the Administration has taken swift action to support Hurricane Fiona response and recovery efforts.
