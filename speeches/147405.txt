Yesterday, National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy convened the 12th meeting of the National Climate Task Force to discuss President Biden's commitment to protecting the most vulnerable Americans from extreme heat, strengthening the nation's resilience to extreme weather events, and lowering energy costs for families.
The Task Force received a science briefing on this summer's forecasted extreme heat, drought and wildfires in the West and flood risk across the East. The Task Force discussed how these climate and weather extremes disproportionately impact historically disadvantaged communities across America, and how the Task Force is taking action to fight back by weatherizing homes; updating building codes to boost resilience; setting flood-risk reduction standards to protect homeowners and businesses; shielding workers from extreme heat exposure on the job; increasing federal firefighters pay across the country to fight wildfires; and accelerating construction of grid-strengthening clean energy projects that will cut consumer costs.
In addition, the Task Force discussed efforts to leverage domestic climate action to spur international efforts, including recent successes advanced through the President's action-focused
