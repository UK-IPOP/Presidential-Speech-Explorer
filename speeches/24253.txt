It is gratifying to learn of the progress of the rent supplement program.
I am particularly pleased to see the wide, representative character of organizations serving as sponsors--cooperatives and labor unions, settlement houses, veterans, civic groups, and especially churches. Their willingness to join forces with private enterprise and government in attacking the stubborn problem of housing the poor must be matched by our readiness to give them all the assistance we can.
This is a new kind of venture for most of them. There is little in their normal experience that prepares them as sponsors of housing projects. They will be greatly aided by business and professional people in the building industry competent to handle the complex problems of project planning and construction. On the other hand, their association with those lacking either competence or proper motivation can lead to failures and discouragement. When liberal government assistance is available, as it is in the rent supplement and the elderly housing programs, there is always some danger of attracting those few speculators who would promote unsound projects for selfish ends.
Guidance by your Department during the formative stages of these projects can be critically important. It is then that you can give nonprofit sponsors the counsel and technical assistance they need. It is then also that you can maintain controls that will keep out the unscrupulous few who might seek to exploit the program.
I want you to give the highest priority to whatever steps are necessary to maintain a system of assistance and surveillance. I shall continue to follow the rent supplement program with keen interest.
