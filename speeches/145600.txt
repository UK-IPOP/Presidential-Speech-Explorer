Today, the Biden-Harris Administration announced state-by-state breakdown of funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, this funding will help states, localities and tribes address home energy costs this winter. The Administration announced that a total of fourteen major utility companies have made commitments to prevent shutting off utilities for Americans applying for aid and expedite assistance, with seven new commitments today 
 on commitments made last November.
: In 2021, the Biden-Harris Administration and Congressional Democrats delivered $8 billion in LIHEAP funding nationally, 
, thanks to an additional $4.5 billion provided by the American Rescue Plan. These funds represent the largest appropriation in a single year since the program was established in 1981. These resources are already allowing states across the country to provide more home energy relief to low income Americans than ever before.
: The American Rescue Plan provided other critical resources that states and localities can use to address home energy costs. ERA programs, which received an additional $21.5 billion in funding from the American Rescue Plan, can provide help with past-due utility bills or ongoing assistance with energy costs to help distressed renters avoid shut-offs and keep current on expenses. State & Local Fiscal Recovery Funds can also be deployed to help deliver energy relief to families.
The Administration has taken action to ensure that these historic resources are distributed swiftly and equitably this winter:
