Dear Mr. Prime Minister:
Thank you for your warm and thoughtful letter on our meeting with the President of Mexico at White Sulphur Springs.
I hope you enjoyed the occasion as much as I did, and I am confident that all three of us profited from the friendly and informal talks that we had. These talks will surely bring even closer the intimate relations between our three countries.
With warm regard,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
