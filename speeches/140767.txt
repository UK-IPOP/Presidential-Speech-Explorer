 that the coronavirus vaccine will be safe and effective, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are 
, fueling anti-vax conspiracy theories, and actively trying to undermine the public's confidence in a vaccine.

: "Well, I think that's going to be an issue for all of us. I will say that I would not trust Donald Trump."

: Kamala Harris says "I think that's going to be an issue" when asked if she would get an approved coronavirus vaccine.
: Joe Biden suggests the coronavirus vaccine won't be "real" and may not be "safe."
: Biden says the vaccine is "not likely to go through all the tests that needs to be and the trials that are needed to be done."
: Biden asks "Who's going to take the shot? Are you going to be the first one to say sign me up?"
: Biden said he would take the coronavirus vaccine "only if we knew all of what went into it."
