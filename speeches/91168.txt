"Rudy Giuliani wasn't just watching a revolution take place, he led a Republican revolution in New York City. It really comes down to the difference between saying and doing. Rudy isn't just reading a political script – he has the record of results to back it up. He cut taxes 23 times, got people off the welfare rolls, cut the bureaucracy, dramatically reduced crime and made New York City safe for families." – Katie Levinson, Communications Director

 "[O]ur moral critique — if anything, I feel, in retrospect, I was not bold enough in Washington, DC. Our moral critique of the welfare state is going to accelerate, and the place it's happening is at the state and local governments. I mean, Giuliani, in his real reform of welfare, is in fact, behaving as an absolute revolutionary." (Newt Gingrich, Remarks At Progress And Freedom Foundation Conference, Washington, DC, 1/22/96)

'The contrast with London couldn't be greater. Where I live now people get mugged, the streets stink of litter and there is graffiti and prostitutes' cards everywhere.' … New York, he says, has benefited from Mayor Rudolf [sic] Giuliani's 'zero tolerance' campaign …" (Colin Freeman, "West End Now As Bad As New York At Its Worst," The Evening Standard, 8/10/01)

Photos … clipped from adult magazines, also festooned artist Chris Ofili's depiction of Jesus' mom. 'The city shouldn't have to pay for sick stuff,' Giuliani said."
