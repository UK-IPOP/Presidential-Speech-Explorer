H.R. 265 - Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019
(Rep. Bishop, D-GA)

H.R. 266 - Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019
(Rep. McCollum, D-MN)

The Administration opposes passage of H.R. 264, making appropriations for financial services and general government; H.R. 267, making appropriations for the Department of Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development, and related agencies; H.R. 265, making appropriations for Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies programs; and H.R. 266, making appropriations for the Department of the Interior, environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2019 and for other purposes. House Democratic leadership has expressed its intent to consider these appropriations bills in sequence. The Administration is committed to working with the Congress to reopen agencies affected by lapsed appropriations, but any effort to do so must address the security and humanitarian crisis on our Southwest border and should restore funding for all agencies affected by the lapse.

For FY 2019, the Administration has repeatedly and clearly communicated the requirements for border security, most recently in a letter from the Office of Management and Budget to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees on January 6, 2019, that reflected the latest in the bipartisan discussions.

Moving these four bills without a broader agreement to address the border crisis is unacceptable. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact appropriations legislation that adequately addresses the security and humanitarian crisis on our Southwest border and gets the entire Federal Government back to work for the American people as soon as possible.
