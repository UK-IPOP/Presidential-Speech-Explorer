The North Carolina for Hillary campaign today unveiled its Women's Leadership Council and names of over 1,500 North Carolina Women for Hillary. The announcement comes as women across the Tar Heel State, including four prominent national supporters - Reverend Marcia Dyson, National Organization for Women President Kim Gandy, political leader Irene Natividad, and Hillary's longtime friend Betsy Ebeling - participate in a statewide Women's Day of Action.
"I am excited to see the dedication of these women who have expressed their support for Hillary," said Gladys Graves, former President of the North Carolina Association of Educators. "Senator Clinton has a long time commitment to the issues that North Carolinians care about including providing health care for every American, defending civil and human rights, standing up for nation's children and boosting our failing economy. She is an intelligent and caring woman and we need someone like that in the White House."
A complete list of women who are supporting Hillary is available upon request.
