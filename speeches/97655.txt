ARLINGTON, VA -- Today, in Pennsylvania, John McCain highlighted the fact that throughout this campaign, Barack Obama's "definition of rich has a way of creeping down." From $250,000 to now $150,000, check out Barack Obama's downward definition of rich:
 (Barack Obama, Remarks, Powder Springs, GA, 7/8/08)
 FURMAN: "Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the op-ed today makes a very important point that, while Barack Obama would not raise taxes for any family making below $250,000 -- in fact, it would cut taxes for almost all of the families making less than that -- Senator McCain cannot make a similar promise for his tax plan because, for the first time in history, he would make families pay taxes on the health insurance that they get from their employers." (Obama For American, Press Conference Call, 8/14/08)
 "He'll restore the middle class by cutting taxes for small businesses, and for 95 percent of workers and their families, including 5.7 million in Ohio. If you make less than $250,000, you won't see your taxes go up one single dime. In fact, your tax rates will be lower than they were under Ronald Reagan." (Governor Ted Strickland, Democratic Radio Response, 10/4/08)
 OBAMA AD: "The Obama Plan: Families Making Less Than $200,000 Get Tax Cut." (Obama Ad, "Defining Moment," 10/25/08)
 "Spreading the wealth was not--he was talking about is all of the tax breaks have gone to the very, very wealthy. For example you have right now, this year, under the old tax policy that was just -- that was put in by George Bush, people making an average 1.4 million a year, good people, decent people, patriotic -- they're going to get an $87 billion tax break. What we're saying is that $87 billion tax break doesn't need to go to people making an average of 1.4 million, it should go like it used to. It should go to middle class people -- people making under $150,000 a year." (Joe Biden, Interview With WNEP Scranton, 10/27/08)
