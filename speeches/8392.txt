PERMIT ME to express my sincere appreciation of your message upon the occasion of the signing by the plenipotentiaries of Chile and Peru of the protocol recording the exchange of the instruments of ratification of the Treaty signed on June 3 last at Lima, whereby the problem of Tacna [p.243] and Arica has been brought to a definite and happy solution. Please accept at the same time my cordial good wishes and those of the people and Government of the United States for your personal well-being, and for the ever increasing prosperity of your great country.
