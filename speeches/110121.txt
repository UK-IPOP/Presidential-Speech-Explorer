"How many months ago was it, 37 months ago, [President Obama] told us that if he could borrow $787 billion, almost a trillion dollars, he would keep unemployment below 8 percent. It has not been below 8 percent since. This president has not succeeded, this president has failed — and that's the reason we're going to get rid of him in 2012." —Mitt Romney

 "Three years ago, President Obama said he would be looking at a 'one-term proposition' if the economy didn't turn around during his first term. 'If I don't have this done in three years, then there's going to be a one-term proposition,' Obama said during a Today show interview broadcast Feb. 2, 2009."

 OBAMA: "[T]oday I'm pledging to cut the deficit we inherited in half by the end of my first term in office. This will not be easy. It will require us to make difficult decisions and face challenges we've long neglected. But I refuse to leave our children with a debt that they cannot repay — and that means taking responsibility right now, in this administration, for getting our spending under control." (President Barack Obama,

 "The 2013 budget the president submitted today does not come close to meeting this promise of being reduced to $650 billion for fiscal year 2013. The president noted in that 2009 speech the Obama administration inherited a $1.3 trillion deficit. The deficit was similarly $1.3 trillion in 2011, is projected to be $1.15 trillion in 2012, and the president's budget claims it will be $901 billion in 2013."

 OBAMA: "What's the first thing you do when you're in a hole? Stop digging. So our first job — I just want to be honest — our first job is to stop adding to our debt. ... You can't be serious about deficit reduction or debt reduction if you are adding more annual debt." (Sen. Barack Obama, Remarks In Fairfax, VA, 7/10/08)
 "The only thing that you can be certain will become law in this budget if Mr. Obama is re-elected is the monumental tax increase. His plan would raise tax rates across the board on anyone or any business owners making more than $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for couples." (Editorial, "The Amazing Obama Budget,"
