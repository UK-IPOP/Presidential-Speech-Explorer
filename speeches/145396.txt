Good afternoon. Pool is gathering ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris' remarks on expanding broadband access to needy American families. The White House announced earlier Monday morning that 10 million American households had signed up for the Affordable Connectivity Program, launched under President Biden's infrastructure law.
Her speech is scheduled to start at 2:45pm and can be live-streamed here:
Feel free to reach out directly with any questions.
Pool entered South Court Auditorium just before 2:30pm. VP will be speaking after FCC chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel and WH infrastructure advisor Mitch Landrieu.
Stage setup is standard for these events, with bipartisan infrastructure law language ("AFFORDABLE INTERNET" and "HIGH-SPEED INTERNET") peppered over the traditional White House graphics.
Pool will send a photo of the scene in a later report. More to followâ€¦
