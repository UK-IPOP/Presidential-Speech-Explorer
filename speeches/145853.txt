, 
The pool arrived near the Biden residence in Rehoboth Beach at 4:08 pm as the president walked to a neighbor's house for a visit. Pool did not see POTUS.
POTUS will be leaving for Wilmington immediately after, a day earlier than anticipated. We are holding nearby until departure.
We're told the president in fact drove to neighbor's house, out of sight of the pool. We are holding.
Per the White House:
Updates on the Biden Administration's COVID surge response activities happening throughout the holidays:
To date, the Federal Government has helped more than 30 States and territories, and deployed over 2,100 Federal personnel and thousands of ventilators, ambulances, and other critical supplies. In addition, more than 13,000 National Guard members have been activated in 48 states to support vaccinations, testing, and clinical care. These deployments are fully paid for by the Federal Government â€” thanks to the President's actions.
Per the White House:
The President and the First Lady are visiting with their friends and neighbors, Ambassador Mark Gitenstein and Elizabeth "Libby" Gitenstein.
The pool joined President Biden's motorcade at 5:24pm and we are now rolling toward Wilmington.
