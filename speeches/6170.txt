 the Yellowstone Forest Reserve, in the States of Wyoming and Montana, was established by proclamation, dated January twenty-ninth, one thousand nine hundred and three, under the provisions of the act of Congress, approved March third, eighteen hundred and ninety-one, entitled, "An act to repeal timber-culture laws and for other purposes", and the act of Congress, approved June fourth, eighteen hundred and ninety-seven, entitled, "An Act making appropriations for sundry civil expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ending June thirtieth, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, and for other purposes";
 it is provided by the aforesaid act of Congress, approved June fourth, eighteen hundred and ninety-seven, that "The President is hereby authorized at any time to modify any Executive order that has been or may hereafter be made establishing any forest reserve, and by such modification may reduce the area or change the boundary lines of such reserve, or may vacate altogether any order creating such reserve"; under which provision the boundary lines of the said forest reserve were changed and the area thereof reduced by proclamation dated May fourth, nineteen hundred and four;
 the public lands in the State of Idaho, within the limits hereinafter described, are in part covered with timber, and it appears that the public good would be promoted by setting apart and reserving said lands as a public reservation;
 President of the United States, by virtue of the power in me vested by the aforesaid act of Congress, approved June fourth, eighteen hundred and ninety-seven, do hereby make known and proclaim that there are hereby reserved from entry or settlement, and added to and made a part of the aforesaid Yellowstone Forest Reserve, all those certain tracts, pieces or parcels of land lying and being situate in the State of Idaho and within the boundaries particularly described as follows:

Excepting from the force and effect of this proclamation all lands which may have been, prior to the date hereof, embraced in any legal entry or covered by any lawful filing duly of record in the proper United States Land Office, or upon which any valid settlement has been made pursuant to law, and the statutory period within which to make entry or filing of record has not expired: Provided, that this exception shall not continue to apply to any particular tract of land unless the entryman, settler or claimant continues to comply with the law under which the entry, filing or settlement was made.
Warning is hereby expressly given to all persons not to make settlement upon the lands reserved by this proclamation.
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
 at the city of Washington this 22d day of May, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and five, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and twenty-ninth.

THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
