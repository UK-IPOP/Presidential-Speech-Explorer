 â€” Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann announced today her blueprint for economic prosperity and job creation titled "American Jobs, Right Now." With 9.1 percent unemployment, $16.7 trillion in national debt, and a severely weakened U.S. dollar, Bachmann is unveiling her vision for restoring confidence in the our financial system, spurring economic growth, and creating jobs for out of work Americans.
"It's evident that the current trajectory of our country is simply not sustainable and President Obama lacks the understanding of how to return to a position of economic prominence in the world," Bachmann said. "My blueprint will create an environment which will create real jobs here at home, and return America to a position of economic prominence in the world."
Eleven Points of "American Jobs, Right Now" Blueprint:
"My solutions are simple. We need to cut government spending, legalize America's God-given natural resources, and stop taxing investment and productivity," Bachmann said. "In other words, we need to do what growing economies do."
