THE United States Government is ready and willing to discuss all problems affecting the relationship between the United States and Panama. It was our understanding that the Government of Panama was also willing to undertake these discussions. Our position is unchanged. We feel in this time of difficulty between the two countries that it is time for the highest exercise of responsibility by all those involved.
