The Administration has no objection to House passage of H.R. 2116, which contains a number of provisions that would expand veterans' health care services. The Administration is committed to providing veterans high-quality health care through an increasingly effective health care system.
The Administration, however, has serious concerns about some of the bill's provisions and will work with the Senate to address them. In particular, the Administration is concerned by provisions:
H.R. 2116 would affect direct spending and receipts; therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimate indicates that the bill would increase direct spending by a total of $2 million during FYs 2000-2004.
