In the past weeks the country has given a remarkable demonstration of confidence. With the reopening of a majority of the banks of the country, currency in excess of $1,200,000,000, of which more than $600,000,000 was in the form of gold and gold certificates, has been returned to the Federal Reserve Banks.
Many persons throughout the United States have hastened to turn in gold in their possession as an expression of their faith in the Government and as a result of their desire to be helpful in the emergency. There are others, however, who have waited for the Government to issue a formal order for the return of gold in their possession. Such an order is being issued today.
The order authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue licenses for obtaining gold for industrial requirements, exportation of gold for trade purposes, and other legitimate needs not involving hoarding. With these exceptions, the order requires all persons to deliver to one of the Federal Reserve Banks, branches, or agencies, or to a member bank, in exchange for other currency, their gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates other than gold coin and gold certificates not exceeding $100 and gold coin having a recognized special value to collectors of rare and unusual coins. While the order is in effect persons who come into possession of gold not covered by the exceptions set forth in the order will also be required to exchange it for other currency. The order is limited to the period of the emergency.
The chief purpose of the order is to restore to the country's reserves gold held for hoarding and the withholding of which under existing conditions does not promote the public interest.
