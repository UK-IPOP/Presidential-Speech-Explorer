WASHINGTON, DC - Today, to celebrate the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Day of Service and honor Dr. King's life and legacy, President and Mrs. Obama, and 10 Cabinet Secretaries and senior Administration officials participated in community service projects in Washington, DC. Led by the Corporation for National and Community Service and the King Center, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Service is an opportunity for all Americans to come together to help meet the needs of their communities and make an ongoing commitment to service throughout the year. This year, the King Day of Service includes thousands of projects - from delivering meals and refurbishing schools to reading to children, promoting nonviolence and more - spread across all 50 states.
"Dr. King dedicated his life to advancing social justice and equal opportunity for all," 
 said. "But more than forty years after his death, there is still much work left to be done. Through service, we honor his legacy by helping our neighbors, strengthening our communities and meeting the challenges we face together. I encourage all Americans to not only continue Dr. King's work through service today, but to make service a part of your lives every day."
