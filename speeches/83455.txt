"These are exciting times for our country. It's a time of amazing change. The economy is changing. The world is changingâ€¦We need to make sure government changes with the times, and to work for America's working families." -

Many of the Nation's labor laws were designed a generation ago. Provisions in these laws do not fit today's changing workplace, and do not give workers the flexibility to spend more time with their families. For some families, the most valuable commodity is extra time, and these families should have options.
