 Hello, everybody. So we're going to North Carolina. Big crowd. Really big crowd. And we're going to have a good time.

We're doing very well in the polls. I guess you noticed it's going up rapidly, and we look forward to it. Hi, Steve [Steve A. Holland, Reuters].



What are you going to do about that mute button tomorrow?

 About who?

The mute button on the—at the debate. The mute button.

 Well, I think the mute is very unfair, and I think it's very bad that they're not talking about foreign affairs. They're supposed to be talking about foreign affairs. And I think that the anchor is a very biased person. Her parents are very biased. But that's my life.

In the meantime, that's the White House standing behind me, right?

Mr. Trump——

Are you doing any preparation?

 Yes, I do prep. I do prep.



Mr. President, are you asking the Attorney General to investigate Joe Biden and his son?

 Thank you very much, everybody.
