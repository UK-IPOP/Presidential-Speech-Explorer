Today, the President is holding a Summit on Global Supply Chain Resilience with the European Union and 14 like-minded countries to foster greater international cooperation on near-term supply chain disruptions and chart a course to strengthen and diversify the entire supply chain ecosystem over the long term—from raw materials, intermediate and finished goods, manufacturing, to shipping, logistics, warehousing, and distribution.

Today's announcements build on the Biden-Harris Administration's ongoing work under 
 to build resilient supply chains that the President issued in February.
Joining the President at the Summit are Leaders and representatives from Australia, Canada, Democratic Republic of the Congo, the European Union, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Italy, Republic of Korea, Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, and the United Kingdom. They will discuss how we tackle the immediate supply chain challenges from this unprecedented economic recovery and build long-term supply chain reliance for the future.
