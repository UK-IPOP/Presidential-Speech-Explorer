Verona, PA - Former Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) made the following statement in reaction to New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's decision not to offer clergy a role in the 10th anniversary ceremony commemorating the terrorist attacks of 9/11.
"James Madison called our nation's vibrant public expression of faith the 'perfect remedy' and if there was ever a day in recent history that our nation needed such a remedy it was September 11th, 2001. It is disconcerting that Mayor Bloomberg decided to exclude clergy from the ceremony commemorating the 10th anniversary of this horrific attack. I urge Mayor Bloomberg to reconsider his unfortunate decision. It is important to allow clergy to attend and take part in the memorial intended to bind the wounds of a still healing nation."
