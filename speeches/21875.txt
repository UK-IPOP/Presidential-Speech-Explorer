Dear Henry:
I was very happy to receive your letter of June twenty-seventh outlining the progress and work of the Commission on National Goals. I am amazed at the speed with which you have put this project together, and I am, of course, pleased that you now think it will be possible to have a report by December.
Your recommendations, I am sure, will be most timely. I feel more strongly than ever that your committee has the opportunity to make an historic addition to our knowledge and understanding of the democratic processes and our national ideals and purposes.
Again, my sincerest thanks for undertaking this most vital assignment.
With warm regard,

Sincerely,
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
