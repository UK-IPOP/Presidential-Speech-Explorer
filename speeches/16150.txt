I AM releasing herewith a letter which I have received from the Secretary of State about the action of the House of Representatives in rejecting the Korean aid bill on Thursday by a vote of 193 to 191. I entirely concur in the Secretary's views as to the seriousness of this action and the necessity for its speedy rectification. I shall take up this matter with congressional leaders and urge upon them the need for immediate action, in order that important foreign policy interests of this country may be properly safeguarded.
