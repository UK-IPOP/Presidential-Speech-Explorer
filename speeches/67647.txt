-There should be four one-on-one debates between President Clinton and Bob Dole, and two one-on-one debates between Vice President Gore and Jack Kemp.
-The debates should be one hour in length, and with a single moderator.
-The first debate should be September 25th or 26th. The last debate should be October 21st or 25th.
-The locations of four of these debates -- St. Louis, Hartford, St. Petersburg, and San Diego--are fine with us. We recommend Cleveland and Detroit for the other two debates, but would be willing to work with the Commission or other sponsors on the locations of these other two debates.
