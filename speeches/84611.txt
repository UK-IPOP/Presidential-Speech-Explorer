 The President was briefed on preparations for the arrival of Hurricane Rita and evacuation efforts at Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) headquarters. The President then traveled to Northern Command headquarters in Colorado to assess the Federal government's efforts to respond to Rita in coordination with state and local officials.
 Working with other Federal, state, and local agencies, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and FEMA have prepared for Hurricane Rita. The Federal government is pre-positioning personnel and supplies to immediately respond.
 Infrastructure Protection division is assessing the potential consequences to critical infrastructure located in the storm's projected path, along with the requirements to secure and restore these facilities in the storm's aftermath. Based upon these assessments, DHS will work with private sector partners and state and local government officials during the recovery phase.
