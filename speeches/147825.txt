There are nine Operation Fly Formula flights currently scheduled for the week of July 13, projected to import more than 4 million, 8-ounce bottle equivalents of infant formula to the United States. By June 19, Operation Fly Formula flights will have imported nearly 12 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of infant formula.
Kendamil infant formula is transferred to Target and made available through the company's national network of stores. Bub's Australia infant formula will be distributed across Walmart's national network of stores, as well as Albertsons Companies' and The Kroger Company's national network of subsidiary stores. In a lot of cases, though it depends on the state, Walmart, Albertsons Companies, and The Kroger Company stores accept benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children or WIC.
Under Operation Fly Formula, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the General Services Administration (GSA), and the Department of Defense (DOD) are partnering to import infant formula from other nations that meets U.S. health and safety standards, so it can get to store shelves faster.
