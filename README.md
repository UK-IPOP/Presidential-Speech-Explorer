# Presidency Project

This project is here to work on presidency data.

Due to the size of the data most of it will be shared with the research team via Microsoft OneDrive. However I may add an "analytical" dataset of a compressed file here.


In order to avoid making a bunch of branches that are not really features, I want us to create a folder for each "project" you work on. I.e. sentiment analysis should be a folder. Predictions should be a folder, and so on.


I will try to keep this README up to date and following our current work.
