# Notes


@dbutler524...

So basically the only file I wrote code in was `presidents/spiders/presidents.py`_. The rest of the files were generated by `scrapy startproject`. In that file you can see I basically provide a list of starting urls, and a `parse` function to run on each of those URL pages. I then yield a new request and run the `parse_speech` function on that page.
